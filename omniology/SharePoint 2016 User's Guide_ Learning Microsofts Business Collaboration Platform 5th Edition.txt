 Acknowledgments 
 I have worked with Apress for many years writing books that provide people with the knowledge they need to 
take advantage of SharePoint, and I am always impressed with the dedication of its staff to providing quality 
publications. Creating a book like this is a team effort, and everyone at Apress has been great to work with. 
I would like to specifically thank several people who have been instrumental in helping to bring this book

 Introduction 
 SharePoint 2016 is Microsoft’s business collaboration platform. It offers web content management, 
document management, reporting, search, and social collaboration capabilities that can be combined into 
comprehensive business solutions. Solutions within this platform can be created more quickly and are more 
cost effective than custom-developed solutions. The platform also provides a far greater degree of flexibility 
than packaged solutions can. 
 That said, in many situations where SharePoint is introduced, people struggle to understand and 
use the platform. In other situations people have difficulty expanding their use of SharePoint from a basic 
intranet or document management environment to a business solution platform. This book addresses these 
struggles and needs. It is meant to serve as a complete reference to all the capabilities available in SharePoint 
to help you understand how to configure and use them. 
 This book was created for SharePoint users at all levels. Beginners are introduced to information to 
help them make effective use of the capabilities the platform offers. Intermediate users are provided the 
details they need to manage SharePoint resources. Advanced users are offered a foundation upon which 
to understand all of the capabilities the platform contains and are shown how to create solutions that take 
advantage of these capabilities. 
 A deep knowledge of the capabilities available in SharePoint, experience working with a variety of 
organizations, and an understanding of how to successfully combine them to create effective business 
solutions have all combined into the creation of this book. I hope this information will enable you to gain an 
in-depth understanding of SharePoint 2016 and more effectively manage and use the platform. 
 Whom This Book Is For 
 The goal of the book is to provide the knowledge anyone needs to use the Microsoft SharePoint 2016 
platform. Whether you are new to SharePoint, are moving from a previous version, or are a longtime 
user, this book will give you the information you need to take effective advantage of the capabilities of the 
SharePoint 2016 platform. 
 If you are looking for a resource that offers you an easy-to-follow and detailed understanding 
of SharePoint, this book is for you. As a user guide, it does not require you to have any programming 
knowledge. It does, however, assume you have a basic understanding of web sites and how to navigate them. 
Some topics also require a working knowledge of Microsoft Office applications, such as Word and Excel.  
 How This Book Is Structured 
 This book organizes the capabilities of the SharePoint platform into a format that serves as an end-to-end 
reference guide, a guide you can read through to learn about all SharePoint has to offer or to look up specific 
topics. It includes step-by-step instructions, figures, tables, and examples. Its chapters describe all of the 
SharePoint capabilities so that you can use them as building blocks for solutions.

 CHAPTER 1  
 Introduction to SharePoint 
Technologies 
 SharePoint 2016 allows for the effective management and sharing of information, automation of business 
processes, collaboration, and interaction with others. SharePoint is Microsoft’s business collaboration 
platform that works closely with Microsoft Office technologies to enable individuals to better organize 
content, share work, and take information with them wherever they go. 
 SharePoint is designed to help in achieving the following  goals  :
• 
 Provide business users with faster, more comprehensive access to actionable 
information. The goal is not only to provide access to more information but to make 
it possible to locate the most relevant information to allow people to rapidly respond 
to business needs. 
• 
 Enable individuals to find the most relevant people to work with, to connect with 
them, and to allow them to work together effectively. Teams can easily share 
information regardless of location, and communities of people sharing common 
interests can be formed. 
• 
 Improve individual and team productivity by making it easy to create and manage 
information and allowing this information to be made available as part of related 
business processes. 
• 
 Reduce the cost and time of providing enterprise-wide business solutions by 
providing a set of application services that work together and can be combined into 
business solutions. 
 Whether you are new to SharePoint, experienced with SharePoint 2016, or moving from a previous 
version to SharePoint 2016, this  SharePoint 2016 User’s Guide is designed to provide the information you 
need to be successful. The author provides a real-world look at how to effectively use all the capabilities the 
platform offers. He includes numerous examples showing how to take advantage of these capabilities and 
suggesting points to consider as you create and work with your SharePoint solutions. 
 The guide discusses the basic and advanced capabilities of both SharePoint Server 2016 Standard and 
Enterprise and provides step-by-step instructions to explain how to use these capabilities to create solutions. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SHAREPOINT TECHNOLOGIES

 What Is Microsoft SharePoint 2016 
 SharePoint Server 2016 is Microsoft’s on-premises version of its  SharePoint platform. This platform comes 
in this on-premises, SharePoint 2016, version as well as a hosted cloud-based service that is part of Office 
365, called SharePoint Online . The capabilities and features available depend on the edition and level of the 
product in place. 
 SharePoint Server 2016 
 SharePoint Server 2016 is hosted internally within your organization or through a general third-party as a 
dedicated solution. The SharePoint Server 2016 platform comes in two editions: SharePoint Server 2016 
Standard Edition and SharePoint Server 2016 Enterprise Edition. Previous versions of SharePoint included a 
SharePoint Foundation edition. With the SharePoint 2016 platform, the SharePoint Foundation edition has 
been discontinued. 
 Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016 Standard Edition provides collaboration services, rich enterprise 
content management, and workflow capabilities. These include:
• 
 Managed web content development 
• 
 Enterprise-level document management 
• 
 Full-featured records retention and management 
• 
 Enterprise-wide search services 
• 
 People integration and social networking services 
• 
 User profile management services 
• 
 Enterprise taxonomy and folksonomy management  
• 
 Web analytics 
• 
 Integrated workflow services 
 Microsoft SharePoint  Server 2016 Enterprise Edition extends the capabilities provided as part of the 
standard edition by adding services that enable data integration and business intelligence services. These 
include:
• 
 External system data and application integration 
• 
 Reporting and analysis services 
• 
 Data visualization and consolidation 
• 
 Web-based form management and automation 
 The capabilities provided by the platform are used to create solutions that bring together people, 
information, systems, and business processes. Microsoft summarizes the wide range of capabilities provided 
by SharePoint 2016 within the following categories:
• 
 Share : SharePoint provides enterprise collaboration and social capabilities designed 
to support teamwork and idea and knowledge sharing with others. 
• 
 Organize : Features are provided that allow you to organize all of your project 
materials, such as documents and tasks, as well as team communication and project 
status. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SHAREPOINT TECHNOLOGIES
3
• 
 Discover : Comprehensive search tools are available to help you find information that 
you need and allow you to locate people based on their background, expertise, and 
interests. 
• 
 Build : Intranet, extranet, and Internet solutions can be made available providing the 
information, processes, and applications people need. 
• 
 Manage : SharePoint provides comprehensive tools that allow delegation of 
management responsibilities to the owners of the processes and related information. 
It provides tools to automate the management and governance of processes and 
information. 
 The capabilities of SharePoint let you create solutions to support your organization’s business needs in 
a cost-effective, easily managed way, where the SharePoint environment becomes your central system for 
managing and accessing enterprise systems and information. 
 As the version of SharePoint your organization implements determines the features made available, 
the version decision is often made by weighing the organization’s business needs over time. When your 
organization hosts SharePoint, you control and manage the environment structure and accessibility and 
have full flexibility to create custom solutions or introduce third-party solutions, if needed, to extend the 
available capabilities to meet business needs. 
 Office 365 SharePoint  Online 
 For organizations that do not want to manage their own SharePoint environment but want to take advantage 
of what SharePoint provides, Microsoft offers SharePoint Online. SharePoint Online is part of Microsoft’s 
Office 365 cloud-hosted platform, which includes hosted versions of SharePoint, Exchange, Skype for 
Business, Microsoft Office, Yammer, and more. SharePoint Online is available on a subscription model, in 
progressive subscription levels enabling organizations to select the service level that best maps to 
their needs. 
 An organization using Office 365’s SharePoint Online can work with and manage its SharePoint 
solutions without the responsibility of managing a SharePoint infrastructure. This service, however, comes 
with some functionality limitations concerning the types and depth of custom solutions that can be created 
on the platform and the types of third-party solutions that can be leveraged. 
 As with locally hosted SharePoint, SharePoint Online’s capabilities are used to create solutions that 
bring people, information, systems, and business processes together, and SharePoint Online offers the same 
wide range of capabilities listed in the last section. 
 The capabilities of SharePoint allow you to create solutions to support your organization’s business 
needs in a way that is cost effective, can be easily managed, and allows the SharePoint environment to 
become your central system for managing and accessing enterprise systems and information.   
 The  Evolution of  SharePoint 
 Microsoft’s SharePoint technology was introduced in 2001, with the release of SharePoint Portal Server 2001. 
This product provided some basic tools designed to let users publish and find documents. It allowed for 
the creation and management of document taxonomies and represented the first step in providing a way to 
catalog and search for documents across an enterprise. 
 Microsoft next released  SharePoint Team Services , which extended the document and publishing 
capabilities of SharePoint Portal Server 2001 by offering information collaboration. It allowed groups of 
individuals to work together to manage documents and lists of information, including contact lists, event 
lists, and link lists. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SHAREPOINT TECHNOLOGIES
4
 In 2003, Microsoft completely re-architected SharePoint and released Windows SharePoint Services 2.0 
and SharePoint Portal Server 2003 as part of the introduction of the first Microsoft Office system. The focus 
of these technologies was to provide a foundation for the collection of applications, servers, and services that 
work together to improve user and team productivity. These products allowed organizations to introduce a 
variety of collaborative business solutions that were previously very difficult and costly to create and maintain. 
 In 2007, Microsoft released Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 
2007. With the release of these technologies, Microsoft extended its Office vision to include capabilities 
that supported the creation of business solutions. These capabilities include content management; 
collaboration; business information management; workflow; intranet, extranet, and Internet support; and 
business integration services. With this release, SharePoint became a business productivity platform with 
which full-featured business applications could be created and information from other applications, data 
sources, and systems could be aggregated. 
 In 2009, Microsoft released the Business Productivity Online Suite ( BPOS ). This was the first Microsoft-
hosted online platform. This platform provided a modified version of the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 
2007 solution, called  SharePoint Online . The BPOS platform allowed for organizations to take advantage of 
Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange Server, Office Communication Server and Live Meeting without 
the need to deploy and maintain these solutions internally within their own organizational IT infrastructures. 
This first release of SharePoint Online was created by taking the available functionality from the released 
Office SharePoint Server 2007 platform and making this functionality available in the BPOS platform. 
 In 2010, the SharePoint platform was enhanced to make it easier to create full-featured business 
solutions and allow it to be leveraged as your organization’s main platform for document management, 
reporting, and web content management. This version also introduced new capabilities, including full-
featured records management, new Microsoft Office integration services, global metadata, taxonomy 
management, and basic social networking services. With this release Windows SharePoint Services was 
renamed SharePoint Foundation. Microsoft also introduced the services architecture to permit more flexible 
scaling and sharing of services. The SharePoint 2010 platform provides a foundation for quickly creating 
productive business solutions in a cost-effective manner. 
 In 2011, Microsoft replaced the existing BPOS platform with a new online hosted platform called Office 
365. As with the BPOS platform, the Office 365 platform included SharePoint online but this version of 
SharePoint Online was created from the previously released SharePoint 2010 product. This release required 
Microsoft to migrate their existing BPOS customers to the new Office 365 platform. 
 In late 2012, Microsoft released the SharePoint 2013 platforms extending the capabilities previously 
available. The platform was extended to help organize and share information and interact with others by 
including a new set of capabilities, such as a new set of social features, content synchronization and sharing 
tools, application publishing and sharing, mobile integration, and layout management. SharePoint 2013 also 
enhanced previously existing functionality in the areas of document and records management, business 
intelligence, search, web content management, and workflow. 
 In 2013, the Office 365 platform was updated to include a new version of SharePoint Online based 
on the SharePoint Server 2013 platform. Again Microsoft created a new online product based on the 
previously released on-premises version of SharePoint. This release of Office 365 has been enhanced since 
its initial release to enhance the existing capabilities and introduce new functionality. This marked a shift 
in Microsoft’s fundamental approach for advancing the  SharePoint platform  . With the introduction of 
Microsoft’s “Cloud First” initiative, new capabilities and enhancements to SharePoint are made within the 
 Office 365  environment, incrementally updating the platform over time. 
 SharePoint Server 2016 is the first on-premises SharePoint platform based on the capabilities already 
available within Office 365’s SharePoint Online platform. All of the enhancements to existing functionality 
and new capabilities within the SharePoint Server 2016 platform come from SharePoint Online. SharePoint 
2016 further enhances the SharePoint on-premises platform providing an environment that optimizes 
how people work, allowing for the creation of comprehensive solutions that easily connect people to the 
information they need. This platform also provides simplified integration with services available in the 
Office 365 platform such as OneDrive For Business and Yammer. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SHAREPOINT TECHNOLOGIES

 Exploring What’s New in SharePoint 2016 
 Since SharePoint 2016 is a byproduct of what is available in Office 365, and Office 365’s SharePoint Online 
was originally based on SharePoint 2013, SharePoint 2016’s interface and general usability is very similar to 
that available in SharePoint 2013. However, SharePoint 2016 does have several new capabilities and updates 
to the previously existing SharePoint capabilities. Among the most noteworthy new and enhanced user 
capabilities are the following:
• 
 Boundaries and Limits —Identifying updates to data management limitations that 
exist in SharePoint.  
• 
 Content databases are now supported beyond the previously recommended 
200GB size limit for general use scenarios to 1TB. 
• 
 List view auto-indexing has been introduced to automatically create indexes in 
lists where the list view threshold would be reached. 
• 
 The maximum size of a file that can be uploaded into a SharePoint library has 
been increased from 2GB to 10GB. 
• 
 The special character limitations for documents being added to SharePoint has 
been reduced. File names can now include the following previously disallowed 
characters: &, ~, {, and }. 
• 
 Performance Improvements —Identifying updates that have been made to optimize 
user performance. 
• 
 Bits has been introduced as the file transfer protocol. 
• 
 New site collections are created at the database level, thus reducing the time 
necessary to create a new site collection.     
• 
 User Interface  Changes  
• 
 The app launcher has been added to the interface to allow for managed access 
to global resources. 
• 
 The list and library menu interfaces have been updated to make adding and 
managing items easier. 
• 
 Content  Management  
• 
 Durable links have been added to content allowing resources to retain links 
when documents are renamed or moved. 
• 
 Document deletion policies can be created and managed in the new Document 
Deletion Policy Center. 
• 
 Image and video previews have been added to document libraries. 
• 
 Sensitive content search is available to locate more than 50 sensitive 
information types, such as credit card numbers, passport numbers, and social 
security numbers. 
• 
 A new mobile experience is included. 
• 
 Open Document Format (ODF) files can be used in document library templates. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SHAREPOINT TECHNOLOGIES

• 
 Hybrid  Support  
• 
 Hybrid Sites features create an integrated sites listing for SharePoint 2016 and 
SharePoint Online sites. 
• 
 Hybrid Search enables the indexing of content across SharePoint 2016 and 
SharePoint Online sites. 
 In the chapters that follow, we discuss the new and updated capabilities of SharePoint 2016 and 
describe how they can be used to create business solutions. 
 Understanding the Value of  SharePoint  2016 
 SharePoint 2016 is an information management and sharing platform, a document and record management 
platform, a workflow platform, a business process management framework, a collaboration platform, 
and a development platform on which Information Worker solutions can be created. The building blocks 
needed to create comprehensive business solutions are available and can be easily assembled into scalable 
enterprise solutions. 
 In today’s work environment, information management and business processes often rely on 
individuals’ knowledge of available information and manual business processes to address many needs. 
As organizations grow dependent on specific individuals to complete activities, it becomes very difficult to 
allow others to participate in them. In these situations, finding information is also a challenge. Individuals 
spend a large amount of time locating needed materials and information, frequently perform duplicative 
work, and recreate information when it cannot be located. Building custom solutions to attempt to automate 
these processes and the information management environment can be a costly and difficult exercise. 
 SharePoint 2016 can provide organizations with a solid foundation of information management, 
collaboration, workflow, and data integration capabilities that combine to create solutions that simplify 
automation of business processes and information management environments. With it, solutions are 
created more rapidly and provide broader business value. 
 SharePoint  Building Blocks  
 SharePoint 2016 includes many capabilities that can be combined to create enterprise business solutions. 
The core capabilities that these solutions are built on include the following:
• 
 Sites provide a structure for securing, storing, and organizing information 
and solutions. 
• 
 Lists are containers for storing structured information.  
• 
 Libraries are containers for storing and managing documents.  
• 
 Workflows automate business processes. 
• 
 Records management extends document management capabilities to manage 
documents through their full lifecycle. 
• 
 Alerts can notify users when information has been added, changed, or removed. 
• 
 Web Parts and Add-Ins allow existing information to be organized and presented 
and provide additional business logic and functionality to be incorporated into the 
environment. 
• 
 Search provides the ability to locate information.  

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SHAREPOINT TECHNOLOGIES
7
• 
 Personalization and social capabilities allow users to create and manage their own 
information, communicate with others, and find others based on their skill and 
experience. 
• 
 Data integration capabilities allow information outside SharePoint to be 
incorporated into SharePoint solutions. 
 In this book, we explore these tools in detail and describe how they are configured and used. We discuss 
the components that make up a SharePoint 2016 environment and provide the information you need to 
effectively use these components to build business solutions.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, we introduced you to the new SharePoint 2016 platform. We discussed how this platform 
has evolved over time and explored the new features introduced and those that have changed as part of this 
latest iteration of the platform. We also reviewed the capabilities that were deprecated in this new release. 
Lastly, we discussed the value that SharePoint 2016 can provide to your organization. 
 In the next chapter, we will start delving into SharePoint 2016 by discussing site collections and sites. 
You will be introduced to the structures and layouts of sites and review the various types of sites and site 
collections that are available to create in SharePoint 2016.

 CHAPTER 2  
 Understanding Sites 
 Sites are the main constructs in SharePoint for organizing and storing all content and resources. They 
provide locations for people to work together and interact with content and processes. Sites can contain lists, 
libraries, pages, workflow, web parts, and apps. 
 Those familiar with previous versions of SharePoint are already aware of lists and libraries, which are 
used to store information within SharePoint. In SharePoint 2016, as it was with SharePoint 2013, lists and 
libraries are part of the SharePoint app, or add-in, architecture. An add-in, or app, is a distinct piece of 
functionality that is used to provide capabilities within a SharePoint site. The default lists and libraries will 
be discussed in detail in Chapter   5 .
• 
 Lists : SharePoint includes a variety of standard lists and the ability to create custom 
lists. Lists are available to facilitate communications and track information. Several 
of the available standard list types also have extended capabilities that help them 
support their primary functions. For example, contact lists have Outlook integration 
features that allow the contained contact details to be made available within the 
Outlook Contacts area. The standard lists can be tailored and custom lists created 
to meet specific information management needs. Lists are discussed in detail in 
Chapters   5 and   6 . 
• 
 Libraries : Libraries are used to manage all media to be stored in SharePoint, 
including documents, forms, web pages, images, and videos. Different types of 
libraries are available to store and manage the different types of media. Libraries are 
discussed in detail in Chapters   5 and   7 . 
 Along with lists and libraries used to store information, workflows, web parts, and apps are used to 
introduce and manage business solutions within SharePoint.
• 
 Workflow s : Workflows are used to incorporate information and people into business 
processes. SharePoint provides a variety of standard workflows. Customized 
workflows can also be created using tools such as SharePoint Designer and Visual 
Studio. Workflows are discussed in more detail in Chapter   9 . 
• 
 Web Parts : A  web part is an application component available within a page in a 
SharePoint site. Web parts are used to display information and introduce application 
functionality. They are discussed in more detail in Chapter   4 . 
• 
 Apps : An app is a solution made available within SharePoint pages through an app 
part. Like web parts, apps introduce business functionality into the SharePoint sites. 
Apps, however, leverage a different architecture, allowing them to be hosted from 
environments other than the SharePoint farm. Apps are made available through the 
online SharePoint app store or through locally managed corporate app repositories. 
Apps are discussed in detail in Chapter   4 . 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
10
 In this chapter we will familiarize you with the general layout and structure of SharePoint sites. We will 
discuss the default site templates available in SharePoint Server, including their layouts and functions, and 
identify the different site templates. 
 Understanding Site Collections and Sites 
 Before we talk about sites, you need to understand how sites are organized. As mentioned earlier, sites are 
the fundamental storage and organization tool within SharePoint used to host and manage all SharePoint 
materials and functionality. Sites themselves are grouped and organized within site collections. Site 
collections are created by  SharePoint IT administrators as the main containers for storing and managing 
related sites. A site collection defines the storage location ( Microsoft SQL Database   called the content 
database) where sites and site resources are saved and maintained. A site collection also defines the 
overall features to be made available within the contained sites, determines overall security configurations, 
determines overall navigation hierarchies, and defines general policies for content and resource 
management. As part of creating a new site collection, your IT administrator defines the content database 
in which the resources will be stored and managed and can identify storage limits to restrict the volume of 
content stored in the collection. The IT administrator will also identify site collection administrators. Site 
collection administrators are individuals who have complete administrative control over the site collection 
and all contained sites. 
 The overall capabilities available within a site collection are determined by the site collection features 
active within it. Site collection administrators determine the features to be made available within their 
sites. There is a default set of active features available within a created site collection that is based on the 
template selected when the collection was created. A set of default site collection features is available as part 
of SharePoint Server Standard, and additional features are available when SharePoint Server Enterprise is in 
use. The default site collection features available in SharePoint Server Standard include the following:
• 
 Content Deployment Source Feature : This feature provides functionality that will 
allow the site collection to be a source for content deployment. Content deployment 
features allow content in a source site collection to be made available within other 
site collections in the environment. 
• 
 Content Type Syndication Hub : Activating this feature introduces capabilities 
allowing the site collection to be a source, or hub, for globally managed metadata 
and for content types that can be used in other site collections in your environment. 
• 
 Cross-Site Collection Publishing : Activating this feature allows lists and libraries 
within the collection to be designated as catalogs for cross-site collection content 
publishing. Defining catalogs allows catalog content to be used within other site 
collections in the environment. 
• 
 Custom Site Collection Help : This feature, when active, creates a library used to store 
custom help materials for use within the site collection. 
• 
 Disposition Approval Workflow : This feature makes the disposition workflow 
available for use within the site. This workflow helps facilitate the expiring of content 
in the environment. 
• 
 Document ID Service : When this feature is active, all documents within the site 
collection are assigned IDs that can be used to identify and locate documents 
regardless of where they are moved within the environment. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
11
• 
 Document Sets : Enabling this feature makes the document sets content type available 
for use within the site collection. This content type allows document sets to be 
created and managed, which are used to group documents within special folders 
where they can share metadata, be passed through workflows, and managed as if 
they were a single item. Document sets are discussed in more detail in Chapter   7 . 
• 
 In Place Records Management : When active, this feature allows documents to 
be declared as records in their source libraries within the collection. Declaring 
a document a record prevents it from being changed. Records management is 
discussed in detail in Chapter   10 . 
• 
 Library and Folder Based Retention : This feature gives administrators the ability to 
override any retention schedules set against content types within lists and libraries. 
This in turn allows documents or list items that leverage these content types to be 
governed by policies against the list or library they are located within instead of 
against the item’s content type. 
• 
 Limited Access User Permission Lockdown Mode : When this feature is enabled, users 
assigned to the Limited Access permission level will not have the ability to access 
pages within the environment. Users are assigned to the Limited Access permission 
level automatically within the environment when the account has access only to 
resources contained within the site, not directly to the site itself. They must be given 
rights within the site that allows them to access the resources to which they have 
been granted rights. 
• 
 Open Documents in Client Applications by Default : When this feature is active, 
documents that have both client applications and web applications available to open 
them will default to opening in the client application. Documents of this type include 
Microsoft Office files. For example, a Word document will open in Microsoft Word—
assuming Word is installed on the computer. When this feature is active, Office 
documents will open in the Office client by default. When this feature is deactivated, 
a Word document will open in Office Web Applications within the web browser—
assuming Office Web Applications have been installed in the environment.

types, site columns, and library templates that can be used to define materials to be 
made available within report searches. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
13
• 
 SharePoint Server Enterprise Site Collection Features : Enabling this feature makes 
the SharePoint Server Enterprise edition features available for use within the site 
collection. This includes features such as Form Services, Visio Services, Access 
Services, and Excel Services. 
 Sites organize and house the information, workflows, services, and applications that make up the 
core of the SharePoint environment. These core elements are used to create business solutions within the 
environment. There are different types of sites available in SharePoint, each having different combinations of 
features enabled to support the purposes of the specific site type. 
 Not all SharePoint site templates are available in all versions of SharePoint. There are four categories of 
site templates available in SharePoint 2016. Each category includes multiple templates that can be used to 
create sites to address different needs. The following are the categories of site templates available by default 
in SharePoint 2016.
• 
 Collaboration : The collaboration site templates are used to create sites supporting 
different ways for people to work together. 
• 
 Enterprise : Enterprise site templates are used to create sites for managing enterprise 
content or data sharing and management needs. 
• 
 Publishing : Publishing site templates create sites designed to support web content 
management needs. 
• 
 Custom : The custom category is displayed when custom site templates are 
created within SharePoint. This category includes all templates created by site 
administrators. Creating site templates is discussed in Chapter   3 . 
 A template is a saved site structure and configuration designed to meet a specific need. When a site is 
created from a template, the newly created site will contain all of the resources saved in the template; it thus 
becomes a copy that can then be used and modified as needed. SharePoint also allows saving an existing site 
as a new site template and so provides the ability to extend the list of available site templates as needed. 
 The site templates available within the discussed categories are dependent on the version of SharePoint 
2016 in use. The following are the default set of site templates available within SharePoint.
• 
 Collaboration  Templates 
• 
 Team Site : This site template provides the most common set of resources 
needed for sites being used to facilitate general team collaboration and 
information sharing. The various features and structures are reviewed later in 
this chapter. 
• 
 Blog : The blog template creates a site to manage information postings and 
comments, enabling social interactions on important topics.  
• 
 Project Site : This template is used to create sites to manage projects and 
initiatives and includes resources to manage project content, status, and 
communications. 
• 
 Community Site : The community site template is used to create sites where 
groups of people come together to discuss, track, and manage important topics 
and common interests. 
• 
 Enterprise  Templates 
• 
 Document Center : The document center site template is used to develop sites 
for creating and managing enterprise documents.  

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
14
• 
 Records Center : This site template is used to create sites to manage corporate 
records. The template allows for the upload and automated routing of 
documents and the creation and management of retention policies for these 
materials. 
• 
 Business Intelligence Center : This site template is used to create sites for viewing 
and analyzing business intelligence data, including KPIs, reports, and analytics.  
• 
 Enterprise Search Center : This site template is used to create a site containing 
pages where searches for content, people, conversations, and videos can be 
executed. 
• 
 Basic Search Center : This site template is used to create a site containing pages 
where searches can be executed to find relevant content.  
• 
 Visio Process Repository : This template is used to create sites that store 
and manage Visio process diagrams and related tasks, discussions, and 
communications. 
• 
 Publishing Templates 
• 
 Publishing  Site : The publishing site template is used to create sites for managing 
and presenting web content. 
• 
 Publishing Site with Workflow : This template includes the same layout and 
structure as the publishing site but also has features enabled to support the 
approval of content as part of the publishing process.  
• 
 Enterprise Wiki : The enterprise wiki site template is used to create sites for 
capturing, managing, and storing knowledge. 
 Structures and features of all of these site types are reviewed later in this chapter. 
 Site Structures and Layouts 
 All SharePoint sites have the same basic overall layout and structure and contain specific elements needed 
to navigate through the environment and manage site resources. The actual organization and layout of a 
SharePoint site’s interface is configurable by environment managers. This section describes the structural 
components and standard elements contained within a SharePoint site and their locations in the standard 
SharePoint site layout. Figure  2-1 depicts the standard Team Site layout, which can be used as a sample 
when discussing the standard elements. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
15
 In this section each of the components making up the SharePoint 2016 environment are discussed. 
 App Launcher 
 The App Launcher, shown in Figure  2-2 , is located in the top left of the banner area and includes global 
SharePoint resources, making them available across all sites within a SharePoint environment. 
 Figure 2-1.  Team site home page 
 Figure 2-2.  App Launcher 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
16
 By default the App Launcher includes the following resources:
• 
 Newsfeed : The Newsfeed option, when clicked, will navigate to the My Site Newsfeed page.  
• 
 OneDrive : The OneDrive option navigates to the Documents library used for 
OneDrive for Business. Depending on the overall configuration of the SharePoint 
environment, this library will either be located in the user’s local SharePoint My Site 
or in the organization’s Office 365 environment. 
• 
 Sites : The Sites option navigates to the Sites page showing sites the user is currently 
following and sites suggested for following. The sites option is also listed in the global 
navigation along with the App Launcher and provides an alternate access method to 
get to the sites page. 
 The My Site capabilities of SharePoint 2016 are discussed in detail in Chapter   12 . 
 User Menu 
 The User  menu  is located in the right banner area in the default layout of the SharePoint 2016 environment. 
The User menu provides access to the user’s details, as well as the ability to sign out of SharePoint, as shown 
in Figure  2-3 . 
 Figure 2-3.  User menu 
 The User menu options are accessed by clicking the username. The User menu includes the following 
options:
• 
 About Me : About Me navigates you to the My Site About Me page. This page allows 
you to manage your profile details and view your activities. 
• 
 Sign Out : The Sign Out option, when clicked, logs you out of SharePoint and 
prompts you to close the web browser window. This option is the same one used in 
SharePoint Foundation. 
 User settings, My Site, and profile information are discussed in more detail in Chapter   12 . 
 Settings Menu 
 The Settings menu, shown in Figure  2-4 , is located to the left of the User menu in the banner area. This 
menu includes site-management options available to logged-on users based on their rights within the site. 
This menu, accessed by clicking on the Settings icon, includes a dynamic set of options based on a user’s 
rights and available features within the site. The available options are discussed throughout this book in the 
context of how they are used while managing the various aspects of SharePoint.  
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
17
 Here are some of the more common options available through the Settings menu.
• 
 Shared With : The Shared With option lists users with access to the current site or 
page. The Shared With window lists the users and provides the following options:
• 
 Invite People : This option allows you to identify users that should be granted 
access to the resource. 
• 
 Email Everyone : This option provides the ability to e-mail all users having 
access to the site. 
• 
 Advanced : The Advanced option navigates to the site’s permissions page.     
• 
 Edit Page : The Edit Page option is used to place the page in Edit mode. Page 
management is discussed in more detail in Chapter   4 . 
• 
 Add a Page : Selecting this option opens the Add a Page window, which allows for the 
creation of a new SharePoint page. 
• 
 Add an App : This option is used to navigate to a page containing the apps that can be 
added to create new lists, libraries, and any other available app. Apps are discussed 
in more detail in Chapter   4 . 
• 
 Site Contents : This option navigates you to the Site Contents page, where all of the 
lists, libraries, and other apps currently available within the site are listed. 
• 
 Design Manager : When the SharePoint Server Publishing site feature is active in a 
site, the Design Manager option is listed in the Settings menu. Selecting this option 
navigates you to the Design Manager Welcome page.  
 Figure 2-4.  Settings menu 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
18
• 
 Change the Look : When the SharePoint Server Publishing site feature is not active in 
a site, the Change the Look option is listed in the Settings menu. Selecting this option 
navigates you to the Change the Look page. 
• 
 Site Settings : This option navigates you to the SharePoint Site Settings page.  
• 
 Getting Started : This option navigates you to the Getting Started with Your Site page 
within the current site. 
 Ribbon 
 The  ribbon  includes the contextual page management options available to you. Initially the ribbon displays 
the ribbon tabs, with the related options presented once a tab is selected. Figure  2-5 shows the page tab 
listing the options available for managing the currently displayed page.  
 Figure 2-6.  Social tools 
 Figure 2-5.  Ribbon 
 Clicking on a ribbon tab shows the ribbon options for the selected tab. By default, these options overlay 
the navigation and title area. To remove the ribbon options from the display in order to see the navigation 
bar and title area, the Browse option can be selected. This option is always available as a ribbon tab. 
 Social Tools 
 The social  tools  are located to the right of the ribbon tabs. These options list the social capabilities available 
for the current page. The social tools include the items shown in Figure  2-6 . 
 The social tools section includes the following:
• 
 Share : When Share is selected, the Share window is presented. This window allows 
identification of users to be granted edit rights to the site. 
• 
 Follow : Clicking on the Follow option adds the currently displayed item to your 
Follow list. Any changes to the item being followed are noted in your activity stream. 
 The social capabilities of SharePoint are discussed in detail in Chapter   12 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES

 Page Management Tools 
 The page management  tools allow management of the current page. Available next to the social tools, the 
listed options are dependent on the page being displayed.  
 Figure 2-8.  Navigation bar 
 Figure 2-7.  Page management tools 
 The following options are available in the page management area.
• 
 Edit : The Edit option is available within the SharePoint web part, wiki, and 
publishing pages. When clicked, the displayed page will enter Edit mode, allowing 
page content to be managed. 
• 
 Focus on Content : This option hides the title, navigation, and Quick Launch areas 
of the site; the content then fills the space these areas were using. This option 
maximizes the space for viewing site content.     
     Navigation Bar 
 The navigation  bar  , which lists navigation options available to users within the site, allows users to access the 
resources hosted through the environment. Figure  2-8 shows the layout of the standard navigation bar. 
 The navigation bar includes only those options that a user’s security rights within the environment 
make available. How the navigation bar is managed depends on whether the SharePoint Publishing 
Infrastructure site collection feature is active. When the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure site 
collection feature is not active, navigation is managed using the Top Link Bar and Quick Launch options. 
These options allow for the creation of links to be used in the Quick Launch and navigation bar areas. When 
the feature is active, the navigation bar is configured using the Navigation option allowing the navigation bar 
to be configured to allow options to be managed directly within the site, to inherit the navigation options 
of the parent site, or be based on a term set. To allow options to be based on a term set, a term set must be 
created within the term store that includes a set of options representing the desired navigation for the site 
and the set must be configured for use as navigation. Referencing this term set causes the navigation bar 
option to be based on the information within the term set instead of on the site structure. 
 Configuring the navigation management approach and its options are discussed in Chapter   3 . 
 Search Bar 
 The Search  bar allows you to enter text to perform a search. The search will initially be scoped against the 
current site. Performing a search navigates you to the search results page, where the items satisfying the 
search criteria are presented. SharePoint Server allows for a search center to be defined, allowing you to 
change the result source of the search by selecting a different option from the Result Source drop-down, as 
shown in Figure  2-9 . SharePoint Search is discussed in detail in Chapter   11 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
20
 Quick Launch  Navigation 
 Located in the left section of the site, the Quick Launch navigation area provides easy access to elements that 
are available within the site. The Quick Launch navigation options can be managed to include links to lists, 
libraries, subsites, and custom URLs. By default, the Quick Launch navigation includes links to the current 
site’s home page and Site Contents page. Sites created from the various site templates include references 
to key site resources in the Quick Launch by default as well. Working with and managing SharePoint 
navigation, including Quick Launch, is discussed in Chapter   3 . 
 Content Area 
 Located to the right of the Quick Launch navigation, the content  area is the main body of the site page. 
This is the section that contains the elements that you want to make available through the site. This section 
may include documents, lists, web parts, apps, and web content. The site’s content area is divided into 
zones where content elements can be placed. The layout of this area and the configuration of the zones are 
dependent on the page template in use. When a site is initially created, the home page will leverage the page 
template identified when the template was created. A user with appropriate rights can later change this 
layout. Two different types of zones are available on pages in SharePoint. The types available on a given page 
are dependent on the type of page being used. Standard SharePoint pages and SharePoint publishing pages 
contain web part zones where web parts can be placed and organized. Another type of page available in 
SharePoint is a wiki page. Wiki pages as well as Publishing Pages contain wiki zones. Wiki zones can contain 
web content, web parts, videos, and other types of content. Pages are discussed in detail in Chapter   4 . 
 Standard Site Templates  
 Earlier in this chapter we listed the site templates available within SharePoint 2016. These templates are 
provided to create sites to meet a variety of needs. Selecting the best site template when creating sites is 
done by understanding the resources available and features enabled by default within a created site in order 
to determine how closely those resources map to your needs. In this section we will detail the layouts and 
configurations of each of the default templates available within SharePoint. 
     Collaboration 
 Collaboration site templates are created to support collaboration efforts performed within SharePoint.

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES

 Team Site Template 
 The Team Site template is used to create sites that facilitate general team collaboration and information 
sharing. A team site contains resources needed to allow a team to bring together the resources needed to 
manage a variety of collaborative work efforts, including projects and other team initiatives. A team site has 
the Wiki Page Home Page feature enabled, which results in wiki pages being available within the site and 
having a wiki page being defined as the site’s home page. Using a wiki page as the site’s home page provides 
flexibility when configuring the layout and the resources available on the page, allowing a mix of web parts, 
web content, images, videos, and more. Figure  2-1 shows the default team site home page layout. 
 The Team Site home page is configured to include a three-zone layout. Wiki page layouts can be 
changed for existing pages, allowing you to update these initial layouts to meet your specific needs. Editing 
pages is discussed in Chapter   4 . 
 A site created from the Team Site template includes components listed in Table  2-1 .

 An Enterprise Search Center includes a page to search for content and a second page for displaying 
results, which vary based on the content searched. You can tailor these sites to meet your organization’s 
searching needs. Updating sites is discussed in Chapter   11  . Figure  2-16 shows the default Enterprise Search 
Center site. 
 Once a search has been performed, the search results page is presented. The results page allows you to 
access the resources located by the executed search and includes the options to search across the specific 
types of content discussed earlier in this section. Figure  2-17 shows the search results page for an Enterprise 
Search site.

 Publishing 
 Publishing templates are used to create sites supporting the creation and sharing of web content. They allow 
you to create sites and site pages that use rich web content resources such as web text, videos, images, and 
web parts. The templates available in the Publishing template category include the following. 
 Publishing Site Template 
 The Publishing Site template is used to create sites that allow you to create web pages that contain web 
content, including text, video, and images. They enable site owners to easily enter information to be 
presented as normal web pages within SharePoint. Figure  2-19  depicts a publishing site’s default layout.  
 Figure 2-19.  Publishing site home page 
 While a publishing site appears to have no content in the content area when it is initially created, the 
site uses a publishing page as its home page. This page includes several elements necessary to manage web 
content, including a location to enter web content, two summary link locations where links can be created to 
reference other information, and web part zones where web parts can be placed to add functionality to the 
site. The page layout can be updated by editing the page and selecting a different layout from the available 
publishing page layouts. 
 Publishing sites also contain several components that can be used to assist in the creation of web 
content pages. Table  2-11 lists the components making up a publishing site.  
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ UNDERSTANDING SITES
37
 The items on the publishing home page are not in web part zones. They exist outside the zones, directly 
on the page itself. These items allow you to add images to the page, enter the content to be presented, and 
create links to other resources. Publishing sites also initially have the following features enabled to support 
web content publishing:
• 
 Access App (SharePoint Server Enterprise only) 
• 
 Following Content 
• 
 SharePoint Server Enterprise Site features (SharePoint Server Enterprise only) 
• 
 SharePoint Server Publishing 
• 
 SharePoint Server Standard Site features  
• 
 Team Collaboration Lists 
• 
 Workflow Task Content  Type 
 Publishing Site with Workflow Template 
 The Publishing Site with Workflow  template is used to create sites similar to those created from the 
Publishing Site template. However, a site created from the Publishing Site with Workflow template extends 
the capabilities of the publishing site by providing the resources needed to allow web content approval 
as part of the content publishing process. Once a site is created from this template, you can configure the 
appropriate approval workflow to manage the content approval process. Workflow management is discussed 
in more detail in Chapter   9 . 
 Sites created from the Publishing Site with Workflow template have the same layout and structure as 
Publishing Site template sites but a different set of default-activated features. They include the following:
• 
 Access App (SharePoint Server Enterprise only) 
• 
 Following Content

 Enterprise Wiki Template 
 The  Enterprise Wiki template is used to create enterprise wiki sites, which are designed to create 
interconnected web pages. Wiki sites contain content-centric web pages that refer to each other to easily 
navigate between related pages. These sites provide an easy way to share information and promote 
collaboration. A site created from the Enterprise Wiki template is shown in Figure  2-20 . 
 Figure 2-20.  An Enterprise Wiki site 
 The home page of an enterprise wiki site describes how to use the wiki and includes page rating 
and page categorization capabilities. This page is a wiki page that can be edited to include the desired

 SharePoint Portal Templates 
 Along with the site templates described so far, SharePoint Server 2016 has a set of templates that are 
available only to technical administrators of SharePoint for creating new site collections. These templates are 
used to create new root sites in a SharePoint environment. However, these templates are not available when 
you create new subsites in your portal. 
 The templates that are available only for the creation of new portals, or site collections, in SharePoint 
2016 include the following: 
 Developer Site 
 The developer sites are created from the Developer Site template and are designed to support the creation, 
testing, and publishing of Apps for Office and SharePoint. This site, created from the Developer Site 
template, includes links to resources to help build Office and SharePoint apps and links to help publish these 
apps to the online store. You can use a developer site as your starting point for creating and publishing your 
SharePoint 2016 Apps. Figure  2-21 depicts the layout of the site created from the Developer Site template 
located on the Collaboration tab of the Create Site Collection page. Site collections are created by SharePoint 
administrators through the SharePoint Central Administration site.

 Summary 
 This chapter introduced site collections and sites. We reviewed their structures and layouts and discussed 
how to manage them. We also reviewed the various site templates that are available to choose from when 
creating new sites in SharePoint Server Standard and SharePoint Server Enterprise. 
 In the next chapter, we will continue our discussion on sites by discussing how they are created and 
managed. We will review key aspects of sites, including the ribbon, security, navigation, and the recycle bin.

 CHAPTER 3  
 Working with Sites 
 Now that you are familiar with the layout and makeup of the different types of SharePoint sites, it is time 
to see how to work with and manage sites and site resources. There are many capabilities available within 
SharePoint site. This chapter will discuss how to use and manage these site features and capabilities, 
including the following:
• 
 Navigating the environment 
• 
 Using the ribbon 
• 
 Managing security 
• 
 Managing navigation 
• 
 Updating the look and feel 
• 
 Working with site and site collection features 
 Navigating the SharePoint Environment 
 Several methods can be used to navigate between sites within a SharePoint site collection hierarchy and 
among the elements within a single site. This section discusses the available navigation approaches. 
 Navigating Within a Site 
 As mentioned previously, sites created underneath other sites are called  subsites . It is very common for sites 
of various types to contain subsites. For example, a human resources site might have a subsite dedicated to 
providing HR benefit details and a separate subsite to manage payroll. A client site containing individual 
project sites for the client would be another example. There are four main ways to navigate a site’s subsites. 
 The first method leverages the navigation bar. This bar, shown in Figure  3-1 ,  contains the list of 
navigation links created by site owners. They may include the following:
• 
  Defining the navigation items within the site, which can be configured to include the 
subsites and pages within the current site, as well as custom links defined by a site 
manager. 
• 
  Configuring the navigation to inherit the navigation from the parent site, which 
provides navigation consistency between sites. 
• 
 Configuring the navigation to use a navigation term set to define the items presented. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
56
 The SharePoint navigation management options determine the approach used for determining details 
available in the navigation bar. Navigation management is discussed later in this chapter. 
 The second method to navigate a site’s subsites is to use the Site Contents page. This page is accessed 
by clicking the  Site Contents link in the Quick Launch menu. Once you’re on the Site Contents page, you can 
navigate to a subsite by clicking on its name in the Subsites section of the page (see Figure  3-2 ). 
 Figure 3-1.  Navigation bar 
 Figure 3-2.  Site Contents page 
 You also use the Site Contents page to navigate to lists and libraries in the current site. These are found 
in the Lists, Libraries, and other Apps section of the page. 
 The third method is to navigate via the Settings menu. This menu can be used to access the Site 
Contents page just mentioned. This navigation option is available only to users having access to that menu. 
You access the Site Contents page using the  Settings menu   as follows:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the site containing the subsite you want to access. 
 
 2. 
  Click the Settings icon to present the Settings menu, as shown in Figure  3-3 . 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
57
 
 3. 
 On the Settings menu, click the Site Contents link. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Contents page, click the name of the subsite you want to view. This 
will present the selected subsite’s home page. 
 The fourth method used to navigate to a subsite is to use a web part that lists subsites on a site page. 
SharePoint Server has web parts that can be used to list subsites. Some of the most commonly used default 
web  part s used to list sites include the following:
• 
 Site Aggregator : This web part allows identification of a set of subsites to display. 
• 
 Sites in Category : This web part lists sites registered in the site directory associated 
with a selected category. 
• 
 Table of Contents : This web part lists the items displayed in the site’s navigation, 
including any listed subsites. 
 Also available are many third-party web parts that provide site and content roll-up capabilities within 
SharePoint. Adding web parts to pages and configuring them are discussed in Chapter   9 . 
 Navigating Sites with Mobile Devices 
 SharePoint allows users with  mobile devices , such as tablets and smart phones, to use the environment. 
There are three options for accessing SharePoint from mobile devices.
• 
 Contemporary view : The contemporary view renders the SharePoint environment 
resources through an HTML5 mobile view. This view provides access to the 
SharePoint lists and libraries within the environment in a form compatible with 
mobile devices. Figure  3-4 shows the HTML5 mobile view. 
 Figure 3-3.  Settings menu 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
58
• 
 PC view : The standard SharePoint interface can be accessed from a mobile device 
by choosing to switch to PC view. It provides the same layout and functionality on 
the mobile device as are available when the site is accessed from a standard web 
browser. 
• 
 Channels : Alternative access interfaces can be defined for specific devices and web 
browser versions. These interfaces can be created for a mobile device or any other 
browser/device. When channels are used, an alternative master page is identified for 
use on the device, allowing a tailored display for that device. Channels are discussed 
in more detail later in this chapter. 
 The approach or approaches used to access the SharePoint environment from mobile devices are 
managed by a technical  SharePoint administrator. 
 
■ Note  Accessing sites using a mobile device requires configuring the SharePoint environment to make it 
available from the network the mobile device is connected to or connecting the mobile device to the network 
the SharePoint environment is connected to. Also, to open a document on a mobile or tablet device, there must 
be a program on it that can open the file.

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
59
 Using the Ribbon 
 The  ribbon is the main management interface for working with site resources. The ribbon provides context-
centric options based on what is being viewed and the rights you have to the item. The available commands 
are organized under ribbon tabs. When a tab is selected, the associated commands are displayed on the 
ribbon. In the standard SharePoint layout, the ribbon commands appear over the navigation bar and title 
area. The ribbon always has a Browse tab that, when selected, hides the ribbon, making the navigation and 
title area visible again. 
 Ribbon tabs and options presented are context-sensitive based on the type of information displayed 
on the page. For example, if you select the Page tab while viewing a team site home page, the list of page 
management commands appears (see Figure  3-5 ). When you finish working with the ribbon commands, 
clicking the Browse tab will hide them, allowing the site title and navigation to be displayed. 
 Figure 3-5.  Page tab on the ribbon 
 Creating Sites 
 Discussing the creation and management of sites in SharePoint 2016 needs to be broken down into two 
parts:creating root, or top-level, sites and creating subsites. A root site, the topmost site in a site collection, 
is created as part of the creation of the overall site collection. A subsite is a site created under an existing 
site. Sites can be nested to create any desired hierarchy. Subsites are created as needed by people with 
appropriate rights. 
 SharePoint root sites are typically created by a SharePoint technical administrator as part of creating a site 
collection. This discussion focuses on creating SharePoint subsites, which any individual having the Create 
Subsite right can do. By default, users with the Manage Hierarchy and Full Control permissions have this right. 
 Subsites can be created within any SharePoint root site or subsite. By default, Owners and Hierarchy 
Managers groups have the appropriate permission levels to create subsites. Managing permissions and 
groups is discussed later in this chapter. 
 To create a new subsite follow these steps:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the site under which the new subsite is to be created. 
 
 2. 
  Navigate to the Site Contents page, by selecting either the Site Content link from 
the Quick Launch area or the Site Contents option from the Settings menu, as 
shown in Figure  3-3 . 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Contents page, click the New Subsite option in the Subsites section.  
 
 4. 
 On the New SharePoint Site page, execute the following steps:
 a. 
 In the Title and Description section, enter the title to use for the site. This 
is the name that will be displayed in any reference to  the site. You can also 
enter an optional description for the site. 
 b. 
 In the Web Site Address section, enter the URL for the site. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
60
 
■ Note It is considered a best practice to exclude spaces and special characters from the URL name of the 
site and for the URL and the site title to be similar. For example, if your site title is Human Resources, the URL 
name should be either HumanResources or HR. 
 c. 
 In the  Template Selection section , select the site template from which the 
new site should be created; the default site templates are grouped by type 
and have the features and layout detailed in Chapter   2 . 
 d. 
 In the  Permissions section , specify whether the user access permissions 
for the site being created are to be the same as those of the parent site or 
whether unique permissions are to be used. If you choose to use the same 
permissions as the parent site, security will be inherited from the parent site 
(changing site permissions in the Managing Site Security section is discussed 
later in this chapter).  
 e. 
 In the  Navigation Inheritance section , select whether the new site’s 
navigation bar is to inherit the options listed in the parent site’s navigation 
bar or is to be managed within the subsite directly (managing the site 
navigation bar is discussed later in this chapter).      
 f. 
 Once all of the necessary information has been entered or selected, click the 
Create button. 
 The subsite is created, and you are taken to the home page of the new subsite. 
 Deleting Sites 
 Anyone who has Hierarchy Manager or Full Control permissions within a site has the ability to delete the 
site. There are two ways to delete an existing SharePoint site. The first way is to delete it within that site’s Site 
Settings page by performing the following steps:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site you want to delete. 
 
 2. 
 From the Settings menu, select the Site Settings option. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Actions section, click the Delete This Site 
link. 
 
 4. 
 On the Delete This Site page, click the Delete button. 
 
 5. 
 On the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The site is deleted, and you are taken to the Your Web Site Has Been Deleted page. 
 The second way to delete a site is found on the Sites and Workspaces page of the site’s parent; that is, 
the site is deleted within its parent. This method can be used to delete only subsites, not the top-level site 
within a site collection. To delete a subsite within the Sites and Workspaces page, do the following: 
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site containing the subsite you want to delete. 
 
 2. 
 From the Settings menu, select the Site Settings option. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Administration section, click the Sites and 
Workspaces link. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
61
 
 4. 
 On the Sites and Workspaces page, click the Delete icon for the subsite 
to be deleted. 
 
 5. 
 On the Delete This Site page, click the Delete button. 
 
 6. 
 In the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The site is deleted, and you are returned to the Sites and Workspaces page. Sites can be deleted only 
when they do not contain subsites. If subsites are nested under the site being deleted, an error message will 
appear if you try to delete the site. 
 Managing Site Security 
 Management of security for a site is the responsibility of the site owner, who is responsible for assigning 
rights to users within their own sites. Rights are assigned either directly to a user or group (managed, 
by default, within an organization’s Active Directory) or through SharePoint that users or groups are 
members of. 
 Security must be configured for every root site within SharePoint. By default, when a new  root site is 
created, the user who created it will specify who the site collection administrators for the site will be, and 
these individuals will be the only people with access to the new site. These site collection administrators will 
then identify the users who are to be granted rights to the site and provide these users with the appropriate 
levels of access. 
 Subsites will either inherit their rights from the site in which they are contained or have unique 
permissions. The security approach used in a subsite is determined by the permission settings configured 
within the site. If security for a  subsite is configured to be inherited from the parent site, security is not 
managed for the site directly; instead, security will be based on rights assigned in the parent site. If security 
for the subsite is configured to be unique, a site administrator will be required to assign the appropriate 
rights to individuals needing access to the site. 
 When you create your own site, it is important to understand the security needs of the individuals who 
will be using the site and to assign users the appropriate security to allow them to work with materials within 
the site. 
     Managing SharePoint Groups 
 SharePoint groups are used to combine user and group accounts to make security assignment easier. By 
default, user and group accounts are Active Directory users and Active Directory groups. However it is 
possible for your SharePoint system administrator to configure SharePoint to use an alternate user and 
group source. User and group accounts will be assigned to SharePoint groups, and the SharePoint groups 
are then used to assign rights within sites. SharePoint groups can be used throughout a site collection 
hierarchy to assign rights within the various sites within the collection and can also be used to assign 
rights to lists and  librar  ies contained within the site. By default, when a new root site is created, a set of 
default SharePoint groups is also created. These groups are listed with their default permission levels in 
Table  3-1 . Other SharePoint groups are created automatically when certain site collection or site features 
are enabled.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
62
 SharePoint groups can be created and customized to meet specific security needs within the SharePoint 
environment. The next sections discuss how to manage SharePoint groups. 
 Creating SharePoint Groups 
 To  create  new SharePoint groups within SharePoint, do as follows:
 
 1.

 5. 
  On the Create Group page, enter the following:
 a. 
 In the Name and About Me Description section, enter the name for the new 
SharePoint group. You can also enter an optional About Me description. The 
About Me information is presented next to the name when the SharePoint 
group is presented. 
 b. 
 If necessary, in the Owner section, update the group owner information. 
The owner has the right to update the site’s group information. The owner 
defaults to the user creating the SharePoint group. 
  c. 
 In the  Group Settings section , specify whether only group members or 
everyone has the ability to view group membership information. You can 
also define whether only the group owner or all group members can add 
and remove group members. 
 d. 
 In the  Membership Requests section , specify whether users can request 
to join or leave the group and whether requests are to be automatically 
accepted. The e-mail address that requests should be sent to is also listed. 
This address can be changed when the Auto-Accept Requests option is set 
to No. By default, the e-mail address will be set as the e-mail address of the 
user creating the group.

selected group. Select the Settings link to view the Settings menu options.  
 
 5. 
 Select the View Group Permissions option from the Settings menu. 
 The View Site Collection Permissions window appears; it displays the sites, lists, and libraries where the 
group is assigned permissions and the permission levels assigned. 
 Changing  Permission Inheritance for a Site 
 As discussed, when you create a subsite, you have the ability to decide whether the subsite is to have 
unique permissions defined or whether it will inherit permissions from its parent site. After the site has 
been created, you can change this setting if security requirements for the subsite change. To change the 
 permission inheritance settings for a subsite, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site in which you need to change permission inheritance. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, click the Site Permissions option from the Users and 
Permissions section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Permissions page, above the permission listings is a message identifying 
whether the site inherits permissions from its parent.  
 
 5. 
 Update the permission inheritance as follows:
 a. 
  If the site currently inherits permissions, the inheritance message will state 
“This web site inherits permissions from its parent.” To stop inheriting 
permissions:
 i. 
 Select the Stop Inheriting Permissions option from the Permissions 
ribbon tab. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
67
 ii. 
 Click the OK button on the confirmation message box. 
 iii.  On the Set Up Groups for this Site page, identify the default Visitor, 
Member, and Owner SharePoint groups for the site. For each, either 
select an existing SharePoint group or elect to create a new group. If you 
select to create a new group, identify a name for the new group and the 
accounts to become members of the group. 
 iv. 
 Click the OK button to save. 
 b. 
  If the site does not currently inherit permissions, the inheritance message 
will state “This web site has unique permissions.” To start inheriting 
permissions:
 i. 
 Select the Delete Unique Permissions option from the Permissions 
ribbon tab. 
 ii. 
 Click the  OK button on the confirmation message box. 
 The site permission inheritance settings are updated, and the Permissions page is refreshed to reflect 
the changes. 
 Managing Permission Levels 
 As discussed previously, SharePoint groups and individual users can be assigned permissions within 
SharePoint sites. When users are added, they are either assigned to a SharePoint group or granted rights 
through direct permission level assignments. How to manage permission level assignments of SharePoint 
groups was discussed in the “Managing SharePoint Groups” section. 
 Permission levels are sets of permissions grouped together to provide a specific set of rights, or class 
of rights, within a site. There are twelve default permission levels in SharePoint. These  default permission 
levels include the following:
• 
 Full Control : This permission level includes all available permissions and grants 
assigned users administrative-level access to the site and all of the site’s resources. 
This permission level cannot be changed or deleted. 
• 
 Design : The Design permission level provides the ability to manage lists, libraries, 
and pages within a SharePoint site, as well as approve content and manage the site’s 
look and feel. This permission level can be edited but it cannot be deleted. 
• 
 Edit : This permission level allows the creation and management of libraries and lists 
and their contained content. This permission level can be edited but it cannot be 
deleted. 
• 
 Contribute : This permission level provides the ability to manage content in a site’s 
lists and libraries. This permission level can also be edited but not deleted. 
• 
 Read : The Read permission level provides read-only access to site resources. This 
permission level can be edited but not deleted.  
• 
 Limited Access : This permission level is designed to be combined with list or library 
permissions to provide access only to specific lists and libraries within a site without 
granting rights to any of its other resources. This permission level cannot be changed 
or deleted from SharePoint. Nor can it be manually set. It is assigned by SharePoint 
automatically on the basis of other rights configurations.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
68
• 
 View Only : As with the Read permission level, with this permission users can view 
pages, list items, and documents. However, with View Only permission, users 
can view these files only with an online viewer, such as viewing Microsoft Office 
documents through Office Online Server. Files cannot be downloaded.  
• 
 Approve : The Approve permission level grants the ability to edit and approve pages, 
list items, and documents when content is configured to require approval. 
• 
 Manage Hierarchy : This permission level, which is similar to Contribute, allows the 
management of site content but adds the ability to create and manage subsites. 
• 
 Restricted Read : The Restricted Read permission level limits Read access in a site 
to viewing of pages, documents, and list items only—not viewing of item version 
history details or permissions information. 
• 
 Restricted Interface for Translation : This permission level is used when individuals or 
systems need only rights to translate content. It allows lists and folders to be opened 
and allows access by remote interfaces. 
• 
 Record Center Web Service Submitters : This permission level allows submittal of 
content to a site without providing higher levels of access, such as reading or editing, 
to the site. 
 Permission levels can be assigned to site users or groups as well as SharePoint groups. To assign 
permission levels to a site user or  group , do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where permissions need to be assigned. This should be a site 
where permissions are not inherited from the parent site.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select Site Settings from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Site Permissions option from the Users and 
Permissions section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Permissions page, click the Grant Permissions command on the 
Permissions tab of the ribbon. 
 
 5. 
 In the Share window, enter the following information:
 a. 
 Select the users and groups to be assigned rights. 
 b. 
  If you do not want to add the entered users to the site’s Members SharePoint 
group, click the Show Options link to select a different group or permission 
level to which to assign rights. 
 c. 
 Once all the information has been selected, click the Share button to save 
the rights. 
 The users and groups are assigned to the selected permission level or SharePoint group and you are 
returned to the Permissions page. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
69
 Adding Permission Levels 
 Additional permission levels can be created when you need a customized set of security rights. For example, 
you may want to give users the ability to create and edit content in a site or specific library but not delete 
anything, or you may want to give someone the ability to add information but not edit or delete it. To create a 
new permission level do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to a site with unique permissions and where you are the administrator.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select Site Settings from the Settings menu. 
 
 3.

level. You can also enter an optional description. The description is 
presented next to the name when the permission level is listed for selection. 
 b. 
 In the Permissions section, check the boxes for all permissions that the new 
permission level should include. Choose the Select All option to add all the 
listed permissions. 
 c. 
 Once all of the necessary information has been entered, click the Create 
button. 
 The new permission level is created, and you are returned to the Permission Levels page. 
 
■ Note  It is recommended to create new permission levels when permission level changes are needed. The 
default permission levels should not be edited. 
 Creating a New Permission Level As a Copy of an Existing Permission Level 
 When there is the need for a new permission level that closely mirrors an existing permission level, you 
can make a copy of the existing item you want to use as a starting point in creating the new permission 
level. For example, if you want a permission level that is the same as the Contribute level but without the 
delete permission, you can create the new permission as a copy of the existing contribute permission level 
and then remove the delete permission right from the copy. Create a new permission level as a copy of an 
existing permission level as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to a site with unique permissions and where you are the administrator.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select Site Settings from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Site Permissions option from the Users and 
Permissions section.

want to delete, and click the Delete Selected Permission Levels link. 
 
 7. 
 On the delete confirmation screen, click the OK button. 
 The permission level is deleted, and the Permission Level page is updated to reflect the change.   
 Managing Site Collection Administrators 
 The discussion so far has focused on how to manage SharePoint groups and permission levels to control 
the rights individuals have in the SharePoint environment. Defining site collection administrators extends 
security management by allowing identification of the individuals responsible for managing the overall 
environment. These individuals are automatically given administrative rights across the entire site collection 
hierarchy. 
 Follow these steps to manage  site collection administrators :
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the top-level site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select Site Settings from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Users and Permissions section, click the Site 
Collection Administrators link. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Collection Administrators page, enter and remove users.
 a. 
 To remove a user, click the  x following the name of the account to remove. 
 b. 
 To add a user, type the name to be added and select the correct account 
from the type-ahead listing presented. 
 c. 
 Once the list of users is correct, click the OK button to save the informatio n.     
 The site collection administrators are updated, and you are returned to the Site Settings page.   
 Changing Site Details 
 There are several aspects of a SharePoint site that the site administrator can update as the need arises. For 
example, updatable information includes the title and description entered when the site was created. Being 
able to update site details is important as the site’s needs change over time. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
72
 Updating  the Site  Title, Description, Logo, and URL 
 You can update the site title, description, and URL entered when the site was created. You can also replace 
the site logo, which is the image that appears at the top of the created site (which defaults to the  SharePoint 
logo ). This allows the site to be properly branded for the organization or group it is created to support. To 
update the site title and description information entered when the site was created and the logo appearing at 
the top of the site, take these steps:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site to be updated. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select Site Settings from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Look and Feel section, click the Title, 
Description, and Logo link. 
 
 4. 
 On the Title, Description, and Logo page, update the following information:
 a. 
 In the Title and Description section, update the site title and description 
information as needed. 
 b. 
 In the Logo and Description section, select a logo either from your computer 
or from SharePoint. Selecting the From Computer option allows you to 
upload a file to SharePoint for use as the site logo. Selecting a file in this 
way uploads the file to the site’s Site Assets library and references it as the 
logo. Selecting the From SharePoint option opens the Select an Asset page, 
where you can choose a logo already in SharePoint for the site. You can also 
enter a description to use as alternative text for the logo. The description is 
displayed when you hover the mouse over the logo.  
 c. 
 When you update information for a site other than the root site in the site 
collection, the Web Site Address section is listed. In this section the URL 
entered when the site was created can be updated. 
 d. 
 Once all updates have been made, click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The updates are applied to the site, and you are returned to the Site Settings page. 
 Configuring Regional Settings for a Site 
 SharePoint sites are designed for use throughout an organization. As a result, there are times when a site 
created within SharePoint is primarily used in time zones other than the one where the SharePoint server 
is located. For example, a team located in California might use a SharePoint site to manage a project’s 
resources, but the SharePoint servers are located in the company’s New York office. In such a case, site 
managers might want to update the site’s regional settings so that date and time displays are based on the 
users’ locale instead of the server’s location. To change a site’s  regional settings , do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the settings need to be changed.  
 
 2. 
 From the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Regional Settings link from the Site 
Administration section. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
73
 
 4. 
 On the Regional Settings page, update the following as appropriate:
 a. 
  Time Zone: Select the standard time zone to use for determining date and 
time for activities performed. 
 b. 
  Locale: Specify the site’s default location to determine how numbers and 
dates are presented. 
 c. 
 Sort Order: Identify sorting preferences to be used within the site. 
 d. 
 Calendar: Determine the calendar format for the site and whether week 
numbering is displayed in the date navigator. 
 e. 
 Enable an Alternate Calendar: Specify, if needed, a secondary calendar 
format to make this alternate information available in the site.  
 f. 
 Define Your Work Week: Specify the days of the workweek, the first day of the 
week, the first week of the year, and the start and ending time of the workday. 
 g. 
 Time Format: Specify the time format to be displayed ( 12- or 24-hour).      
 h. 
  Once all other information has been appropriately updated, click the OK 
button to save the settings. 
 Updated  settings will be saved, and you will be returned to the Site Settings page.  
 Defining the Welcome Page 
 The  welcome page  is the initial page displayed when you navigate to a site. The default page, defined as 
the site welcome page, does not have to remain as the site’s welcome page. Any other page within the site 
can be the entry page. In fact, the welcome page for most SharePoint site templates is a  Home.aspx  page in 
the Site Pages library. Having the default page located in a site library lets you apply content approval and 
management rules to this page as you would to other site content. To allow the ability to change a site’s 
welcome page, the SharePoint Server Publishing site feature must be active. Activating this feature adds the 
Welcome Page management options to the Site Settings area. 
 To update the default welcome page for a site, follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to change the welcome page. 
 
 2. 
 From the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Look and Feel section, click the Welcome Page link.  
 
 4. 
 On the Site Welcome Page screen, enter the URL for the welcome page for the 
site, or click the Browse button to locate the appropriate page. Once the page is 
identified, click the OK button.      
 The site’s welcome page is updated, and you are returned to the Site Settings page.   
 Managing Site Navigation 
 SharePoint sites contain two areas  of  navigation options, the Quick Launch and the navigation bar. The 
Quick Launch, located by default to the left of the site’s content area, is typically used to list resources located 
in and under the current site:key lists, libraries, subsites, and so on. The navigation bar, by default, is located 
at the top of the content area. It is typically used to provide the site’s global or standard navigation options, 
and it provides consistency in navigation within the site collection. This section discusses these navigation 
resources and describes how to manage the options contained within them. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
74
 Customizing Quick Launch Navigation for Sites 
 The Quick Launch menu, which typically includes navigation options within a site, can be managed by users 
with Design or Full Control rights. Management of Quick Launch navigation varies based on whether the 
SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure site collection feature has been activated within an environment. 
 Configuring the Quick Launch Display:Tree View and Standard View 
 The Quick Launch area has two displays that can be presented:standard view and tree view. Quick Launch 
view settings are managed through the Tree View options available in the Look and Feel section of the Site 
Settings page, which let you determine which of the views is included in the Quick Launch area. By default, 
the standard Quick Launch is enabled, displaying a set of links that access specified site lists, libraries, and 
subsites, as well as identified custom links. Standard Quick Launch is shown in Figure  3-7 . If this option is 
disabled, Quick Launch links are removed from the area, leaving only the Site Contents link.  
 Figure 3-8.  Quick Launch tree view 
 Figure 3-7.  Quick Launch standard view 
 When tree view is enabled, the Tree View tool is used in the Quick Launch area. The Tree View tool lists 
all sites, libraries, and lists within the current site. The tool provides the ability to expand any listed subsites to 
view the lists, libraries, and subsites contained within those subsites as well. Tree view is shown in Figure  3-8 .   
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
75
 Standard and Tree views for the Quick Launch menu can be managed as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site to be updated. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select Site Settings from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Look and Feel section, click the Tree View link.

 In the Enable Quick Launch section, check or uncheck the Enable Quick 
Launch option to enable or disable the Quick Launch standard view. 
 b. 
  In the Enable Tree View section, check or uncheck the Enable Tree View 
option to enable or disable the Quick Launch tree view. 
   c. 
   Once all options are properly set, click the OK button.     
 The updates to the site are applied, and you are returned to the Site Settings page. 
 Configuring Quick Launch Options 
 While you can use the Tree View options discussed previously to determine which views are made available 
within Quick Launch, the available links in the Quick Launch can also be managed. Items can be reordered, 
and listed headings and links can be added, updated, or removed tailoring Quick Launch to help meet the 
navigation needs of your site. 
   Changing the Order of Quick Launch  Items   
 Three options are available for managing Quick Launch menu items. The options differ based on whether 
the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature is active. The first option, which is always available in 
SharePoint, allows navigation items to be managed directly in the Quick Launch menu. 
 To manage Quick Launch navigation items directly from the home page of the site, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to manage the Quick Launch menu. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, click the Edit Links option at the bottom of the Quick 
Launch area to place the links in Edit mode (see Figure  3-9 ).

 To reorder the listed items, drag and drop them into the appropriate order. 
 
 4. 
 Once all items are in the appropriate order, click the Save option to save the 
changes made. 
 The changes to the Quick Launch menu are saved, and the Quick Launch menu returns to its 
standard view. 
 The second way to reorder Quick Launch options is through the Quick Launch management page, 
which is available in the Site Setting area when the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature is 
not enabled. To edit the order of Quick Launch items through the Quick Launch management page, do as 
follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to manage the Quick Launch menu.

the listed options to the desired order. 
 
 6. 
 Once all items are set to the appropriate order, click the OK button to save the 
changes. 
 The changes to the Quick Launch order are saved and you are returned to the Quick Launch page. 
 When SharePoint Server is used with the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature enabled, 
the Quick Launch management option is not available in the Site Settings page. Instead, the Navigation 
option is available. This option is used to manage both the Quick Launch options and the navigation bar. To 
manage the order of Quick Launch through the Navigation option, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to manage the Quick Launch menu. 
 
 2. 
 Select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.

 Once the items are in the proper order, click the OK button to save the changes.      
 The changes will be saved, and you will be returned to the Site Settings page.  
 Adding New Headings and Links to the Quick Launch 
 As with reordering Quick Launch options, you can add new headers and links in three different ways. The 
first way to add new headers and links to Quick Launch is from within the Quick Launch area itself. To 
update the Quick Launch options in this way, do the following:
 
 1.

 Customizing the Navigation Bar 
 The SharePoint navigation bar is the main navigation tool for a SharePoint portal. Navigation can be based 
on either a site’s structure or a customized set of metadata terms managed through a term set. In talking 
about creating sites, we discussed how to choose whether the navigation bar should inherit its options 
from the parent site, list its own options based on the structure under the site, or based options on a term 
set. These settings can be updated and the navigation bar can be further customized through the site’s 
navigation management tools. 
 Updating Navigation Bar  Inheritance Settings 
 As with the Quick Launch, how you update the navigation bar within a SharePoint site depends on whether the 
SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure site collection feature is enabled. The inheritance settings for the 
navigation bar determine the options presented in global navigation. To change the navigation bar inheritance 
settings when the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature is disabled, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the subsite where you want to update the navigation bar’s inheritance settings.

within the current site. 
 b. 
  If the site is currently managing its own navigation options, click the Use 
Links from Parent option, and then click OK on the confirmation screen. 
This will cause the navigation bar to inherit its options from the parent site.         
 The navigation inheritance settings will be updated. If the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure 
feature is enabled, the navigation bar inheritance options are managed as follows:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the subsite where you want to update the navigation bar’s inheritance 
settings. 
 
 2. 
 Select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3.

the “Display the same navigation items as the parent site” option. You can 
also specify whether subsites or pages are included in the navigation bar.  
 b. 
  If you want the site to manage its own navigation options, select the 
“Structural Navigation:Display the navigation items below the current site” 
option. You can also specify whether subsites and pages are included in the 
navigation bar. 
 c. 
 If you want the site to use a set of terms in a term store as the navigation 
options, select “Managed Navigation:The navigation items will be 
represented using a Managed Metadata term set”, and then, in the Managed 
Navigation:Term Set section, select the term set to use. 
 
 5. 
 Once the navigation inheritance options have been selected, click the OK button 
to save the settings and return to the Site Settings page.     
 The navigation inheritance settings will be updated, and you are returned to the Site Settings page. 
 Changing the Order of Navigation Bar  Items  
 The order of navigation bar items can be managed directly on the site’s navigation bar or through the 
navigation management tools, which include the Top Link Bar options when the SharePoint Server 
Publishing Infrastructure feature is disabled or the navigation settings options when the SharePoint Server 
Publishing Infrastructure feature is enabled. 
 To update navigation item order directly on the navigation bar, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to manage the navigation items. 
 
 2.

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
84
 Adding New Headings and Links to the Navigation Bar 
 When the navigation bar is not inherited from the parent site and not based on a term set, you can customize 
options to meet your site’s navigation requirements. There are three different ways to add new headings and 
links to the navigation bar. The options available also depend on whether the SharePoint Server Publishing 
Infrastructure site collection feature is enabled. 
 The first way to add options to the navigation bar is directly from the navigation bar itself. To add new 
heading and links to the navigation bar using the navigation bar management tools, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to add navigation options.  
 
 2. 
 Click the Edit Links option to show the editing options for the navigation bar 
(see Figure  3-12 ). 
 
 3. 
 Click the +Link option to add a new link. 
 
 4. 
  In the Add a Link window, enter the Text to Display as the option and the 
optional address information, and then click the OK button.  
 
 5. 
  Click the Save button to save the navigation updates. 
 The new header or link will be added, and the navigation bar will return to the standard view. 
 A second way to add options to the navigation bar is available when the SharePoint Server Publishing 
Infrastructure feature is disabled. This method leverages the Top Link Bar management options as follows:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the site where you want to add navigation options.  
 
 2. 
  On the site’s home page, choose the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Top Link Bar option from the Look and Feel 
section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Top Link Bar page, select the New Navigation Link option. 
 
 5. 
 On the New Navigation Link page, enter the web address and description for the 
new option and click the OK button. 
 The new link will be added, and you will be returned to the Site Settings page. 
 A third approach to add options to the navigation bar is used when the SharePoint Server Publishing 
Infrastructure feature is enabled. In this case, the navigation bar is managed through the navigation 
management options. To add headers and links to the navigation bar in this way, do the following:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the site where you want to add navigation options.  
 
 2. 
  On the site’s home page, choose the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
  On the Site Settings page, select the Navigation option from the Look and Feel 
section. 
 
 4. 
  On the Navigation Settings page, in the Structural Navigation:Editing and Sorting 
section, do the following:
  a. 
  To add a new link to the navigation bar:
 i. 
 Highlight the Global Navigation item. 
 ii. 
 Click the Add Link option. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
85
 iii.  On the Navigation Link menu, enter the title and URL for the link, 
specify whether the link is to open in a new window, and enter an 
optional description for the link. You can also specify the audiences 
(users or groups) the link is targeted to. If you target a link to a user 
or group, the link is presented only to that user or group. Once all the 
information has been entered, click the OK button to save the new link.      
 b. 
  To add a new header to the navigation bar:
 i. 
 Highlight the Global Navigation item. 
 ii. 
 Click the Add Heading link option. 
 iii.  On the Navigation Heading menu, enter the title for the heading, 
enter an optional URL, and if the link is to open in a new window, and 
enter an optional description for the header. You can also specify the 
audiences (users or groups) the header is targeted to. If you target a 
header to a user or group, the header is presented only to that user or 
group. Once all the information has been entered, click the OK button 
to  save the new header. 
 
 5. 
 On the Navigation Settings page, click the OK button to save the changes to the 
navigation. 
 The changes will be saved, and you will be returned to the Site Settings page. 
 Edit Headings and Links to the Navigation Bar 
 As with adding items, editing items in the navigation bar is available when the navigation bar is not 
inherited from  the parent site and not based on a term set. The three different options for editing headings 
and links in the navigation bar depend on whether the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure site 
collection feature is enabled. 
 The first way to edit options in the navigation bar is directly from the bar itself. Only custom links and 
headers can be edited directly from this view. Site and page references listed here cannot be edited. To edit 
the navigation bar’s heading and links using navigation bar management tools, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to edit navigation options. 
 
 2. 
 Click the Edit Links option to show the edit options for the navigation bar 
(see Figure  3-12 ). 
 
 3. 
  Click the custom link or header to edit to show the Edit Link option, as shown 
in Figure  3-13 . 
 Figure 3-13.  Navigation bar Edit Link option 
 
 4. 
 Click the Edit Link option for the navigation item you want to edit.  
 
 5. 
 In the Edit Link window, update the Text to Display and Address information as 
appropriate, and click the OK button. 
 
 6. 
 Click the Save button to save the navigation updates. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
86
 The header or link is updated, and the navigation bar returns to the standard view. 
 A second method for editing options in the navigation bar is available when the SharePoint Server 
Publishing Infrastructure feature is disabled. Edit through Top Link Bar management options by doing the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to edit navigation options. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, choose the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Top Link Bar option from the Look and 
Feel section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Top Link Bar page, select the Edit icon for the navigation item to be edited. 
 
 5. 
 On the Edit Navigation Link page, update the item’s web address and description 
as appropriate, and click the OK button. 
 The link will be edited, and you will be returned to the Site Settings page. 
 A third approach to edit options in the navigation bar is available only if the SharePoint Server 
Publishing Infrastructure feature is enabled. In this case, navigation management is handled through the 
Navigation Settings. The only editable options are custom headers and links, not those representing sites 
and pages within the current site. To edit navigation bar headers and links, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to edit navigation options. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, choose the Site Settings option from the Sett ings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Navigation option from the Look and 
Feel section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Navigation Settings page, in the Structural Navigation:Editing and Sorting 
section, do the following:
 a. 
  Highlight the custom link or header to be edited.  
 b. 
 Click the Edit option. 
 c. 
 In the Navigation Link or Navigation Heading window, update the 
information as appropriate, and click the OK button to save the changes.      
 
 5. 
 On the Navigation Settings page, click the OK button to save the changes to the 
navigation. 
 The changes will be saved, and you will be returned to the Site Settings page. 
 Deleting and Hiding Headings and Links on the Navigation Bar 
 As with the other navigation management activities, there are three approaches to deleting and hiding  links 
in the navigation bar. Not all links can be deleted. Items representing sites and pages must be hidden to 
remove them from the navigation bar. 
 The first way to hide or delete navigation options is directly from the navigation bar itself. To remove or 
hide headings and links in the navigation bar with navigation bar management tools, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to remove navigation options.  
 
 2. 
 Click the Edit Links option to show the Edit options for the navigation bar 
(see Figure  3-12 ). 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
87
 
 3. 
 To the right of the navigation option is either the hide option (an eye) or the delete 
option (an  x ). To hide or delete the listed item, click the hide or delete option.
 a. 
  If hiding the item, the hide option changes from an eye to a hyphen ( - ). 
 b. 
  If deleting an item, the item is removed completely from the navigation bar. 
 
 4. 
 Click the Save button to save the navigation updates. 
 The navigation bar returns to the standard view. 
 A second method for deleting or hiding options in the navigation bar is available when the SharePoint 
Server Publishing Infrastructure site collection feature is disabled. To delete the options through Top Link 
Bar management options, doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to delete navigation options.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, choose the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Top Link Bar option from the Look and 
Feel section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Top Link Bar page, select the Edit icon for the navigation item 
to be edited. 
 
 5. 
 On the Edit Navigation Link page, click the Delete button.  
 
 6. 
 Click the OK button on the delete confirmation window. 
 The link will be deleted, and you will be returned to the Top Link Bar page. 
 A third approach to remove options in the navigation bar is available when the SharePoint Server 
Publishing Infrastructure site collection feature is enabled. In this case, the navigation bar is managed 
through the navigation management options. As with editing directly from the navigation bar, items 
representing sites and pages can be hidden but not deleted. Only custom links and headers can be deleted. 
To hide or delete headers and links from the navigation bar in this way, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to delete navigation options.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, choose the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Navigation option from the Look and 
Feel section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Navigation Settings page, in the Structural Navigation:Editing and Sorting 
section, do the following:
 a. 
  Highlight the  item you want to hide or delete.  
 b. 
 Click the Hide or Delete option. 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to save the changes made. 
 The changes will be saved, and you will be returned to the Site Settings page. 
 Configuring Managed Navigation for the Navigation Bar 
 The navigation bar can be configured to use a term set to govern navigation options. When the navigation is 
configured to use a term set, navigation is based on the items included in the term set. In order to support 
use of a term set to define the navigation options of a site, the term set must first be created, and then the 
navigation must be configured to leverage the term set. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
88
 Creating a Navigation Term Set 
 To create a  term set to manage navigation, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, choose the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Term Store Management option from the Site 
Administration group. 
 
 4. 
 On the Term Store Management Tool page, check the list of names in the Term 
Store Administrators section to verify you are an administrator. If you are not 
listed, do the following to add your account:
 a. 
  Enter your account information in the Term Store Administrators box, and 
click the Check Names option to verify the account.  
 b. 
 Click the Save button to save the account. 
 
 5. 
 Create a new term set for managing the navigation options.
 a. 
  Select the desired term store group under which to create the new term set 
and select the New Term Set option from the drop-down menu. 
 b. 
 Enter the name for the new term set. 
 
 6. 
 Configure the term set for managed navigation by doing the following:
 a. 
 Click the Intended Use tab in the Term Store Management tool 
(see Figure  3-14 ). 
 Figure 3-14.  Term Store Management Tool Intended Use page 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES

 b. 
 On the Intended Use page, select the Use This Term Set for Site Navigation 
option and click the Save button. 
 
 7. 
 Create terms for the term set. A term is created by doing the following:
 a. 
 Select the term set and select the Create Term option from the drop-down 
menu. 
 b. 
 Enter the name for the new term. 
 c. 
 Highlight the name of the new term and select the Navigation tab in the 
main area of the Term Store Management tool. 
 d. 
 In the Navigation Node Type section of the page, select Simple Link or 
Header to create a standard navigation link and enter the URL for the link 
or click the Browse button to browse to the desired URL. Then click the 
Save button.  
 
■ Note  You can also use the term-driven page option to navigate to a page with options for defining content 
to be presented. 
 Configuring the Navigation Bar to Use the Term Set 
 Once a navigation term set is available the navigation bar can be configured to use the term set if the 
SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure site collection feature is enabled. To configure a site to use a 
term set for navigation do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the term set will be used. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, choose the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Navigation option from the Look and 
Feel section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Navigation Settings page, do the following:
 a. 
 In the Global Navigation section, select the Managed Navigation option. 
 b. 
 In the Managed Navigation Term Set section, select the created term set. 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The navigation is updated to include the options listed in the term set. 
 
■ Note  This section described using a term set created within the site collection for managing navigation 
options. A SharePoint administrator can create a term set in SharePoint Central Administration for use across 
site collections. In this scenario, the term set would be created in the Central Administration Managed 
Metadata Service, and then the site would be configured to use the navigation options, just as described in the 
“Configuring the Navigation Bar to Use the Term Set” section. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES

 Using the Recycle Bin 
 SharePoint 2016 includes recycle bin capabilities that can be used to review and, if necessary, restore items 
previously deleted from SharePoint. Items that can be restored include documents, list items, document 
libraries, lists, and sites. Deleted  items are placed in the recycle bin for a set number of days, a period 
defined by the SharePoint technical administrator. Figure  3-15 depicts the recycle bin. 
 Figure 3-15.  The recycle bin 
 The SharePoint recycle bin has two levels of  functionality . The first is the site recycle bin. When items are 
deleted from the current site, they are listed in the site recycle bin until they are manually deleted or until the 
deletion date exceeds the purge period, defined as the number of days an item is retained before it is purged 
from the recycle bin. The second level of recycle bin functionality is the site collection recycle bin. This bin 
lists all items deleted from any site in the site collection, including items purged from the site recycle bins 
before the purge period ends. It gives site collection administrators a higher degree of control over managing 
deleted items and helps ensure information is properly protected from inappropriate deletion. 
 Viewing Items in the Recycle Bin 
 Users can view  items  placed in a site’s recycle bin by doing the following:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the site where you want to access the recycle bin. 
 
 2. 
  On the site’s home page, click the Site Contents link in the Quick Launch area or 
from the settings menu. 
 
 3. 
  On the Site Contents page, click the Recycle Bin link, located to the right of the 
Lists, Libraries, and Other Apps header. 
 You will be navigated to the Recycle Bin page for the site. This page lists all items in the recycle bin. 
 Site collection administrators are also provided the ability to view all items deleted across the site 
collection. This is done as follows:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the root site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
  On the site’s home page, click the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.  
 
 3. 
  On the Site Settings page, select the Recycle Bin option from the Site Collection 
Administration section. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
91
 Restoring Items from the Recycle Bin 
 To  restore  items from the site recycle bin or the site collection recycle bin, follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Recycle Bin page or the site collection Recycle Bin page, as 
described previously. 
 
 2. 
 On the Recycle Bin or site collection Recycle Bin page, check the box for each 
item you want to restore and click the Restore Selection link.     
 The items are restored, and the Recycle Bin page is refreshed to reflect the change.  
 Deleting  Items from the Recycle Bin 
 A site administrator has the ability to purge, or remove, items from the site’s recycle bin so that other users 
will not have access to restore them. This is useful when a document was added to a library inappropriately 
and should be removed without letting library users access the item. Deleting the item from the library will 
remove it from general user access but does not protect against users with the ability to access the recycle 
bin from restoring the item. To protect against this a site collection administrator can remove the item from 
the site recycle bin. To delete an item from either the site or site collection recycle bin, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Recycle Bin page or the Site Collection Recycle Bin page, as 
described previously. 
 
 2. 
 Delete items in either of the following ways:
 a. 
 To delete select items from the recycle bin or site collection recycle bin, 
check the box for each item you want to delete and click the Delete 
Selection link. 
 b. 
 In the site collection recycle bin, all items in the recycle bin can be deleted 
by selecting the Empty Recycle Bin link.      
 
 3. 
 On the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The selected items are deleted from the recycle bin, and the Recycle Bin page is updated to reflect 
the changes. 
 Managing Site Design and Layout 
 The layout and look of the SharePoint environment can be tailored to meet an organization’s design 
structure and layout. Several methods can be used to update the look of a SharePoint environment. They 
include the following:
• 
 Selecting a theme for the environment that changes the colors and imagery of the 
existing layout. 
• 
 Creating new page layouts and master pages to create new layouts for the SharePoint 
environment. 
• 
 Creating alternative master pages for specific devices. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
92
 Updating Site Themes 
 A  site theme  in SharePoint 2016 defines the colors, imagery, fonts, and page layout for the SharePoint 
environment. Individuals granted the Design or Full Control permission level have the ability to change site 
themes. There is a default set of site themes available for selection and update, and a SharePoint interface 
designer, in conjunction with a site collection administrator, has the ability to create and deploy custom 
themes as well. 
 To update the theme for a site, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to change the theme.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Change the Look option from the Look and 
Feel section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Change the Look page, select the theme to use as the starting point for the 
new site layout. 
 
 5. 
 On the Change the Look configuration page, shown in Figure  3-16 , the selected 
theme can be adjusted to meet virtually any needs. The changes that can be 
made to the theme include the following:
 a. 
 The background image can be changed or removed. Click the Change 
link below the image thumbnail and select a new image to use as the 
background for the theme. If your browser supports HTML5 you can also 
drag the new image over the thumbnail to upload the file. If you want to 
remove the background image entirely, click the Remove link below the 
thumbnail image. 
 b. 
  The color scheme for the theme can be updated. Use the Colors drop-down 
and select the desired color combination. 
 c. 
 The site layout can be selected. The site layout identifies the page layout 
the site will use. By default, there are two available page layouts:Oslo and 
Seattle. The Oslo layout does not include the Quick Launch area and has the 
navigation bar positioned below the site title. The Seattle layout includes the 
Quick Launch area and places the navigation bar above the site title.  
 d. 
 The font family for use in the site can be selected. Select the font listing from 
the Fonts drop-down list. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
93
 
 6. 
  Once any changes to the theme’s background image, colors, site layout, and fonts 
have been made, the theme can be tested by clicking the Try It Out link. Clicking 
this link will generate a preview of the look. You see the layout as it will appear 
within the site. 
 
 7. 
 On the Preview page, decide whether the look is complete.
  a. 
  Clicking the No, Not Quite There option returns you to the Change the Look 
configuration page, where additional alterations to the look and feel can be made.  
  b. 
  Clicking the Yes, Keep It option saves the theme as the new look for the site 
and returns you to the Site Settings page. 
 Working with Design Manager 
 Design Manager organizes the SharePoint layout management tools in a single place to make it easier to 
manage the look and feel of the SharePoint environment. Design Manager becomes available when the 
SharePoint Server Publishing site feature is active within a site and allows the following to be managed:
• 
 Manage Device Channels : Allows you to define master pages to use with specific 
browsers and devices. 
• 
 Upload Design Files : Provides instructions for uploading design resources to the site 
collections master page gallery. 
 Figure 3-16.  The Change the Look configuration page 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
94
• 
 Edit Master Pages : Lists the master page library view of the master pages available in 
the system for edit. This area also provides links that will allow an HTML file to be 
selected for conversion to a master page and to create a new minimal master page.  
• 
 Edit Display Templates : Provides access to a library view of the display templates 
available within the master page gallery. Display templates define the layout of 
elements within the environment. 
• 
 Edit Page Layouts : Provides access to a library view of the page layouts available for 
use in the master page gallery. Page layouts are used to define the configuration of 
pages within the SharePoint environment. This page includes a link to create new 
page layouts. 
• 
 Publish and Apply Design : Lets you select master pages for use within the site for 
both the Site Master Page, used in standard pages, and the System Master Page, used 
in SharePoint system pages, such as the Site Settings page. 
• 
 Create Design Package : Allows you to package design assets into a file for easy 
transport to other site collections. 
 The next section discusses these Design Manager resources. 
 Managing Device Channels 
 Device channels give the ability to define master pages for use with specific browser versions and devices. 
For example, you would create a channel when you want a different layout or design when viewing the site 
from a mobile device. To create a device channel, do the following:
 
 1. 
 From the Settings menu, select the Design Manager option. 
 
 2. 
 From the Design Manager: Welcome page, select the Manage Device Channels 
option from the left navigation. 
 
 3. 
 On the Manage Device Channels page, click the Create a Channel link.  
 
 4. 
 In the Device Channels New Item window, enter the following information:
 a. 
 Name: Specifies a name for the channel 
 b. 
  Alias: Specifies a single word to identify the channel for access through 
code. It is advisable to make the Alias similar to the Name for identification 
purposes. 
 c. 
 Description: Lists an optional description that can be used to describe the 
new channel. 
 d. 
 Device Inclusion Rules: Includes the set of rules that specify when the 
channel should be used to identify when the alternate master page should 
be used. 
 e. 
  Active: Specifies whether the channel should be actively used. Inactive 
channels do not impact the master page used in the environment.      
 f. 
  Once all the information is entered, click the Save button to save the new 
channel. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
95
 The new device channel will be created, and you will be returned to the Manage Device Channels page. 
You can then edit existing device channels by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 On the Manage Device Channels page, click the Edit or Reorder Existing 
Channels link. 
 
 2. 
 On the Device Channels page, click the item you want to edit from the list of 
device channels, and select the Edit Item option from the Items ribbon. 
 
 3. 
 On  the Device Channel Edit Item screen, make any needed changes to the device 
channel details, and click the Save button to save the changes made.     
 The specified changes are made to the channel, and you are returned to the Device Channels page. 
 Once a new device channel is created a master page can be associated with the channel. To do this 
you can use the Publish and Apply Design option in Design Manager. To be able to apply master pages to 
specific device channels, you must first deactivate the Mobile Browser View site feature. You do this using 
the following steps:
 
 1. 
 Within the site where the channels will be applied, select the Site Settings option 
from the Settings menu. 
 
 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Manage Site Features option from the Site 
Actions section. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings Site Features page, click the Deactivate option for the Mobile 
Browser View feature. 
 With the Mobile Browser View feature disabled, master pages can be defined for active device channels. 
This is done as follows:
 
 1. 
 From the Settings menu on the site where the device channel should be applied, 
select the Design Manager option. 
 
 2. 
 From the Design Manager:Welcome page, select the Publish and Apply Design 
option from the left navigation. 
 
 3. 
 On the Design Manager:Publish and Apply Design page, select the Assign Master 
Pages to Your Site Based on Device Channel link. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Master Page Settings window, select the desired master pages for the 
listed channels and click the OK button. 
 The master pages are defined for the channels. 
 Selecting a New Site Design 
 Design Manager can be used to select and configure new site  designs  . Design Packages include layouts 
created by designers using other design tools, such as Dreamweaver to use as a basis for creating a new 
master page. To upload a new design package, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Site Settings page from any site within the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, select Design Manager from the Look and Feel section

 5. 
  Once the preview is confirmed, clicking the Copy to Clipboard button below the 
HTML Snippet section will copy the component with the current configuration to 
the clipboard for copying into the master page. 
 Snippet code can be copied into a master page to inject the SharePoint components into the master 
page file. 
 Managing Page Layouts 
 Page templates are used to define the layout of pages within a site. They define the zone configuration of 
the content and whether standard items, such as Quick Launch navigation, are included. Page layouts are 
dependent on the site’s master page, which dictates the overall style and layout of the site. To manage page 
templates, do the following:
 
 1 
  Navigate to the Site Settings page from any site within the site collection.  
  Figure 3-18.  Component Configuration page

 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, select Design Manager from the Look and Feel section. 
 
 3. 
 On the Design Manager page, select the Edit Page Layouts option from the Quick 
Launch area. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit Page Layout page, do the following:
 a. 
 To create a new page layout:
 i. 
 Select the Create a Page Layout option above the master page  listing. 
 ii. 
 In the Create a Page layout window, enter a name for the new layout; 
then select the master page the layout will be associated with and the 
content type identifying the page layout type to create. Click the OK 
button to create the page. 
 b. 
  To edit an existing page layout, open the page layout to edit it and make any 
necessary changes. 
 Reset ting Site Definitions 
 Over time, many customizations may be made to a site and the pages within the site. Some of these 
customizations are made to the site’s look and feel to meet specific needs. Tools, such as SharePoint 
Designer, are available to make these changes. When tools are used to make changes directly to a site’s 
pages, the pages can become  unghosted —that is, the edited pages are no longer based on the site definition 
that defines the page’s standard configuration and layout. Resetting the site definition allows you to reset the 
pages to leverage the site definition allowing the site pages to again conform to the standard configuration 
and layout of the environment. 
 Use the following steps to reset, or reghost, a page or site previously customized.
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site containing the pages to be reset. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, click the Site Settings option in the Settings menu.  
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Actions section, click the Reset to Site 
Definition link. 
 
 4. 
 On the Reset Page to Site Definition page:
 a. 
 To reset a specific site page, select Reset Specific Page to Site Definition 
Version, and type the URL of the page to reset. 
 b. 
 To reset all pages in the site, select Reset All Pages in This Site to Site 
Definition Version. 
 c. 
 Once the appropriate options are selected, click the Reset button. 
 The site page or entire site is reset, or reghosted, and you are returned to the Site Settings page.  
 Controlling  Access to Page Layouts and Site Templates 
 SharePoint gives site owners the ability to control page layouts and site templates used for creating pages 
and subsites within a site when the SharePoint Server Publishing site collection feature is enabled. You 
can let people create new pages from any available layout or allow only specific page layouts to be made 
available for use within a site. If you limit a site to only allow use of specific page layouts, you can then decide 
whether subsites under that site will also be limited to the specified page layouts. This capability is useful in 
situations where the site should contain only a specific type of content, such as press releases. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
99
 Site templates can be managed similar to page layouts in that you can decide whether subsites created 
under a site can leverage any available site templates or just specified ones. You can also determine whether 
this setting is inherited by the current site’s subsites. These capabilities are useful if you need to delegate site 
creation rights to users but want to restrict their options—for example, if you have an Enterprise Projects 
site under which users create a site to manage each project. You create a template for project sites that 
includes resources that are to be part of a project site. Then you restrict the available site templates in the 
Enterprise Projects site to the template you created. This ensures all project sites created will be based on the 
appropriate template. 
 Lastly, you can specify default settings to use when new pages are created in a site. This includes the 
default page template and URL. You have the ability either to inherit the settings from the parent site or to 
select them for the current site. While the site layout and URL can be changed after a site is created, it is good 
practice to set these defaults appropriately to minimize changes needed as new pages are created. 
 Follow these steps to update page layout and site template settings:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Site Settings page for the site where you want to update the page 
layout and site template settings. 
 
 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Look and Feel section, click the Page Layouts 
and Site Templates link. 
 
 3. 
 On the Page Layout and Site Templates Settings page, do the following:
 a. 
  In the Subsite Templates section, select “Subsites inherit site templates from 
parent site”, “Subsites can use any site template”, or “Subsites can only use 
the following site templates” and choose the templates that should be made 
available. You can also indicate whether you want to reset all subsites to 
inherit the preferred subsite template settings.  
 b. 
 In the Page Layouts section, select “Pages inherit preferred layouts from 
parent site”, “Pages in this site can use any layout”, or “Pages in this site can 
only use the following layouts” and choose the layouts to be made available. 
You can also indicate whether you want all subsites reset to inherit the 
preferred page layout settings. 
 c. 
 In the New Page Default Settings section, select “Inherit default page 
layout from parent site” or “Select the default page layout” and select the 
appropriate layout from the list. If you want, you can also reset all subsites 
to inherit these new page settings and identify if blank spaces in page names 
 should be converted to dashes when new pages are created.      
 d. 
 Once all options are appropriately updated, click the OK button. 
 The page layout and site template settings are saved, and you are returned to the Site Settings page. 
 Identifying Master Pages and Style Sheets for a Site 
 As  discussed, master pages define the general structure and layout of SharePoint sites. SharePoint pages are 
designed to leverage master pages so that sets of pages can have the same overall structure and layout and 
so that any changes to this structure and layout can be made in a central place. The changes made will apply 
to all associated pages. When you alter a master page, such as by adding a logo or changing the page format, 
that change is reflected across all pages of the site associated with that master page. 
 Style sheets are used in conjunction with master pages to define color scheme, fonts, backgrounds, 
translations, and other aspects used in site pages. Site managers are able to modify a site’s style sheet to 
change page attributes. Thus, site managers can update SharePoint to conform to their organization’s 
corporate identity. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
100
 The  master page and style sheet for a site with the SharePoint Server Publishing site feature enabled can 
be updated by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Site Settings page for the site where you want to update the 
master page or style sheet. 
 
 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Look and Feel section, click the Master Page link. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Master Page Settings page, make the following selections:
 a. 
 In the Site Master Page section, either inherit the master page from the 
parent site (available in subsites only) or choose a master page for this site, 
and select whether all subsites of the current site will inherit this master 
page setting. 
 b. 
 In the System Master Page section, either inherit the master page from the 
parent site (available in subsites only) or choose a master page for form and 
view pages within the site, and select whether all subsites will inherit this 
system master page setting. 
 c. 
 In the Theme section, identify whether subsites of the current site will 
inherit the current site’s theme. 
 d. 
 In the Alternate CSS URL section you can determine if an alternate CSS 
will be used. You can choose to inherit the alternative style sheet from the 
parent site (available in subsites only), use the default style sheet or specify 
an alternate style sheet for the current site. If you specify an alternative 
style sheet, you must specify the file to reference and whether you want 
to reset all of the current site’s subsites to use the defined alternate. An 
alternate style sheet alt ers the styling defined in the master page.  
 e. 
 Once all the necessary changes have been made, click the OK button 
 The changes you made are saved, and you are returned to the Site Settings page.   
 Managing Site Templates 
 As discussed earlier in this chapter, when creating a new site or subsite, you select a template as part of the 
creation process. The site template defines the initial set of components, such as lists and libraries, included 
in the new site and defines the layout of these components. 
 Creating Site Templates 
 The templates discussed in Chapter   2 are the default templates provided in SharePoint Standard and 
Enterprise. Once you create a new site based on one of the available templates and tailor it to meet your 
specific needs, you can save the updated site as a new template to be used when additional sites are created. 
Any user assigned the full control permission level in a site can create templates from the site. The templates 
you create will be available for selection when sites are created within the same site collection where the site 
template was created. 
 Here is an example of how site templates are used. Say that you have a site called Budget Planning 
that contains a subsite called 2017 Budget. You update the 2017 Budget site to reflect the layout needed to 
support yearly budget planning. (Creating components and editing page layouts are discussed in Chapters   4 
through   12 .) Once the 2017 Budget site includes the desired structure and content, you save it as a template 

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
101
called Budget Planning. This Budget Planning template is then available when other new sites are created. 
By saving the 2017 Budget site as a template, you save yourself and others the effort of duplicating the 
customizations made to the 2017 Budget site when additional yearly budget sites are required. Also, you 
provide others a starting point for creating yearly budget sites that include the layout and components they 
will need in their sites. This helps ensure that all yearly budget sites have a consistent structure and contain 
the resources needed to properly support the budget planning process. 
 
■ Note  If your SharePoint environment contains multiple site collections, templates created within a site 
collection will be available only within that collection unless a SharePoint technical administrator registers the 
template for use across collections or unless the template is copied into each site collection’s solutions gallery. 
 To create a site template for use in the current site collection, follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site you want to save as a site template.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, click the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.  
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Actions section, click the Save Site as 
Template link. 
 
 4. 
 On the Save Site as Template page, enter the following:
 a. 
  In the File Name section, enter the filename to use to save the template.  
 b. 
 In the Name and Description section, enter the template name. This is the 
name that will appear on the templates tab when a new site is created. You 
can also enter an optional description for the template.  
 c. 
 In the Include Content section, specify whether content within the selected 
site is to be included in the template. Content includes any documents 
and list data that exists in the selected site. To include the content in the 
template, check the Include Content check box.      
 d. 
 Once all necessary information is entered, click the OK button.  
 e. 
 On the Operation Completed  Successfully page, click the OK button. 
 A copy of the site is saved as a template, and you are taken to the site’s home page. The new site 
template is added to the Solutions gallery and activated, making it available to users creating sites. 
 
■ Note  The Save Site as Template option is not available in a site where the SharePoint Server Publishing 
Infrastructure site collection feature is enabled. When this feature is enabled in a site collection, the Save Site 
Template page can be accessed in only sites where the SharePoint Server Publishing site feature is not active 
by manually navigating to the  /_layouts/15/SaveTmpl.aspx page within the site. 
 Editing Site Templates 
 To  edit a site template, simply edit the site you originally used to create the site template or create a new site 
from the existing template and make the edits to that site. Once the changes have been made to the site, 
create the new template by following the steps described previously. Then deactivate and delete the old 
template from the Solutions Gallery. Deleting templates is discussed in the next section.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ WORKING WITH SITES
102
 Deleting Site Templates 
 While you cannot remove the default site templates provided, by executing the following steps, you can 
delete any custom site templates created in a site collection:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, click the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.  
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Web Designer Galleries section, click the Solutions link.  
 
 4. 
 On the Solution Gallery page, hover over the template to delete, click the down 
arrow to present the item’s context menu, and select Deactivate. 
 
 5. 
 In the Deactivate Solution window, click the Deactivate command from the View 
ribbon tab.  
 
 6. 
 On the Solution Gallery page, hover over the template to delete again, click the 
down arrow to present the item’s context menu, and select Delete. 
 
 7. 
 On the delete confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The template is deleted, and the Solution Gallery is updated to reflect the deletion.   
 Managing Site Content and Structure 
 SharePoint includes administrative tools that allow site owners to view their SharePoint site, list, and library 
resources in a single tree structure. These resources can also be managed directly from this same location. 
This is done from the Site Content and Structure management screen shown in Figure  3-19 .

 Managing Site and Site Collection Features 
 Along with all of the other site capabilities discussed, you can also enable and disable specific site features 
within the SharePoint sites and enable and disable specific site collection features in the overall site 
collection. (The features available in SharePoint Foundation and SharePoint Server Standard and Enterprise 
are discussed in Chapter   2 .) 
 Managing Site Features 
  Site features   are made available within a site by activating them. Activating a feature makes the functionality 
associated with the feature available. To activate or deactivate site features, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the feature needs to be managed. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, click the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.

 On the Site Collection Features page, click the Activate/Deactivate button 
associated with the site collection feature to activate or deactivate.     
 The feature status is changed, and the associated feature capabilities are enabled or disabled.   
 Managing Content Variations 
 Organizations that operate globally often need to publish resources in several languages to properly 
support all users. The process of creating the various translations, or variations, of the content can be time 
consuming and difficult to manage. 
 SharePoint gives site owners the ability to define site variations and define primary and variation 
locations for content needing to be translated. Changes made to the primary location can be automatically 
or manually propagated to the associated variations. The variation capabilities can be integrated with 
SharePoint workflows that drive the updating process for variations. These workflows can also be integrated 
with the SharePoint 2016 translation services to automate the actual creation of the translated versions. 
 When  users access a site that participates in a variation set, they are automatically taken to the variation 
supporting their language. SharePoint makes this determination based on the web browser’s language 
preferences. If no variation supporting the user’s browser language preferences exist, the user is taken to the 
primary site page for the variation set. 
 To use the SharePoint variation capabilities, configure the variation settings within the site collection. 
These settings include identifying the source location where variations are to be created and configuring 
variation creation management and notification settings. To configure the variation settings for the  site 
collection , follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Site Settings page for the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Collection Administration section, click the 
Variations Settings link. 
 
 3. 
 On the Variations Settings page, follow these steps:
 a. 
 In the Site, List, and Page Creation Behavior section, specify whether 
variations are to be created for all new elements or the user will choose 
which language sites, if any, the new content should be synchronized to. 
 b. 
 In the Recreate Deleted Target Page section, specify whether target pages 
are to be re-created when the source page is republished.  
 c. 
 In the Update Target Page Web Parts section, indicate whether changes to 
web parts in the source page are to carry through to the target pages.  
 d. 
 In the Notification section, specify whether an e-mail will be sent to the 
contact person for the target when a new subsite or page is created or when 
a target page is edited.

 e. 
  Once all settings have been properly configured, click the OK button to save 
the information. 
 The information is saved, and you are returned to the Site Settings page. 
      Variation Labels 
 You can create multiple variations of information in SharePoint. Variation labels are the names given to 
the variants of an item so that they can be uniquely identified. For example, if you have a site that contains 
information that needs variants created in Spanish and French, each of these alternative versions will be 
provided a label uniquely identifying it. Follow these steps to create a new variation  label .
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Site Settings page for the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Collection Administration section, click the 
Variation Labels link.

 The variation label is created, and you are returned to the Variation Labels page. 
 You can edit the variation  labels by hovering over a listed label and selecting the Edit option from the 
drop-down menu. To delete variation labels, hover over a label and select the Delete option. 
 After the variation settings are configured and variation labels have been created, you need to create the 
variation hierarchy. The variation hierarchy is the tree structure needed under the identified root variation 
site to store and manage the site variations. To create the variation hierarchy, click the Create Hierarchies 
link on the Variation Labels page, as shown in Figure  3-22 . Clicking this link will cause SharePoint to create 
the necessary site hierarchy to support the variant configuration under the root variation site.  
     Translatable Columns 
 Site collection administrators are able to identify list and library columns that need to be translated when 
they appear in a variant site. This identifies elements to translate as part of the variation management 
workflow process. To update the  translatable column settings, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Site Settings page for the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Collection Administration section, click the 
Translatable Columns link.

 On the Translatable Column Settings page, check the box in front of each column 
name that must be translated and click the OK button.     
 The translatable column settings are saved, and you are returned to the Site Settings page.  
 Variation Logs 
 The variation  log presents an operational log listing the variation process details. This log can be used to 
review the status and health of the variation process. To view the variation logs, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Site Settings page for the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Collection Administration section, click the 
Variation Logs link. 
 The Variation Logs page lists the logged events for the variation process. 
 Managing Help  Information  
 SharePoint 2016 allows site collection administrators to identify the help collection to be used when help 
links are clicked within a site. By default, only one help collection is listed. This collection contains the 
standard SharePoint help details. To replace this default collection, a SharePoint developer or administrator 
must create a new collection and make it available for selection. 
 To manage help collections, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, click the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.  
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Collection Administration section, click the 
Help Settings link.

 Using SharePoint Designer for Site  Management 
 SharePoint Designer is a client tool that can be used to create, extend, and deploy SharePoint solutions. 
SharePoint 2016 includes the ability to identify whether SharePoint Designer can customize site collection 
components. Through the SharePoint Designer settings, you can specify the following:
• 
 Whether to allow SharePoint Designer to be used to edit the site collection. 
• 
 Whether site administrators can detach pages from the original site definitions and 
unghosting the pages. 
• 
 Whether site administrators can customize master pages and page layouts through 
SharePoint Designer. 
• 
 Whether site administrators can change the hidden URL structure of their sites 
through SharePoint Designer. 
 To update SharePoint Designer settings for a site collection, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, click the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.  
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, in the Site Collection Administration section, click the 
SharePoint Designer Settings link. 
 
 4. 
 On the SharePoint Designer Settings page, specify the SharePoint Designer 
management preferences, and click the OK button.     
 The SharePoint Designer settings are updated, and you are returned to the Site Settings page. 
 
■ Note  In the past, new versions of SharePoint Designer were created to work with a new version of 
SharePoint. For example, SharePoint Designer 2010 was used to manage resources in SharePoint 2010 and 
SharePoint Designer 2013 was created to manage resources in SharePoint 2013. No new version of SharePoint 
Designer is being created to manage resources in SharePoint 2016. Instead, SharePoint Designer 2013 will 
continue to be used to manage resources in SharePoint 2016. 
 Summary 
 This chapter discussed how to manage and configure SharePoint sites. We demonstrated how to create and 
delete sites and how to manage site security and navigation. We also reviewed the recycle bin showing how 
to review items that had been deleted and how to restore these items. We then looked at the tools that are 
available to change the style and layout of a site. We also delved into site templates discussing how to create, 
edit and delete them. Lastly, we discussed site and site collection features. 
 In the next chapter we will look at pages, apps, and web parts, which are key components needed to 
configure your SharePoint sites. We will discuss the various types of pages that can be created within a 
SharePoint environment and review how to create and manage them. We will then detail how to add and 
manage web parts and app parts within the pages you create.

 CHAPTER 4  
 Pages, Apps, and Web Parts 
 Pages, apps (also called add-ins), and web parts are used to organize and present information and 
to introduce business functionality into SharePoint sites. Pages are used to create organized views of 
information. The information provided in SharePoint pages can be text, images, and videos organized to 
support information access and management needs. Pages can also be used to hold apps, which can display 
data such as views of list and library content or introduce other business solution capabilities. 
 In this chapter, we discuss the different types of pages available within SharePoint and how to create 
and manage these pages. We also discuss apps and web parts and how they can be used to present content 
stored within the sites and introduce additional business application capabilities into your SharePoint sites. 
 Pages 
 SharePoint pages are the tools used within sites to organize and present information. When a SharePoint 
site is created, it typically contains a single SharePoint page that acts as the site’s home page. Three types of 
pages can be created in SharePoint 2016, each with its own capabilities designed to satisfy different needs. 
These types of pages include the following:
• 
 Web Part pages 
• 
 Wiki pages 
• 
 Publishing pages 
 Web Part Pages 
 The most basic type of page that can be created in SharePoint 2016 is the web part page. A web part page 
 contains   web part zones, in which apps and web parts can be added and configured. Web part zones are 
organized within pages based on the pages’ defined layouts. Web part zones are designed to store apps and 
web parts that are functional components adding application functionality to pages within SharePoint. We 
discuss apps and web parts in more detail later in this chapter. 
 Web part pages are best used when you, as the  site administrator  , need to add a page that contains 
specific functionality yet would not need to be managed by general site users and would not need significant 
standard textual content in the page. This type of page allows addition of only apps and web parts to the 
defined zones. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS

 Creating Web Part Pages 
 In SharePoint  2016  web part pages are created by default within the Site Pages library. This library is also 
used to create wiki pages, which we discuss later in this chapter. You can also add the ability to create web 
part pages in other libraries if you want to. 
 The Site Pages library is added to a site through the activation of the Wiki Page Home Page feature. 
Activating this feature will also update the site’s home page so that it is based on a wiki page instead of the 
default web part page. To activate the Wiki Home Page feature, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to enable the Wiki Page Home Page feature. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the settings menu.  
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Manage Site Features option from the Site 
Actions section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Features page, click the Activate option for the Wiki Page Home Page 
feature. 
 The Wiki Page Home Page feature is activated, creating the Site Pages library and reconfiguring the site’s 
home page so that it is based on a new page, named  Home.aspx , created in the Site Pages library. 
 There are times when you will not want to enable the Wiki Page Home Page feature within a site 
because you do not want to make the ability to create wiki pages available within the site or want the home 
page of the site to be updated to a wiki page. When this is the case, you can make the web part page content 
type available in a different library within the site, allowing web part pages to be created within that library. 
To make web part pages available in a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you need to make web part pages available. 
 
 2. 
 If it does not yet exist, create the document library where you want to store 
created web part pages. 
 
 3. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to be able to save web part pages.  
 
 4. 
 On the library’s home page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 5. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings page. 
 
 6. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the Content Types section, select Yes for “Allow 
Management of Content Types” option and click the OK button. 
 
 7. 
 On the Settings page for the library in the Content Type section, select the “Add 
from Existing Site Content Types” option. 
 
 8. 
 On the Add Content Types page, select the Web Part Page option from the 
Available Site Content Types section, click the Add button to add the item to the 
Content Types to Add section and then click the OK button.     
 With the ability to add web part pages now available in the library, you can create web part pages in that 
library. 
 Whether you decide to create web part pages in the  Site Pages library or provide the ability to add web 
part pages to a different library in the site, you create web part pages by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to create the web part page. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Web Part Page option from the New 
Document drop-down menu, located on the Files ribbon tab.  

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS

 3. 
 On the New  Web Part page,  do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 In the Name section, select the name for the new page. 
 
 
 b. 
  In the Layout section, select the layout for the page. The layout identifies the 
zone configuration for the new page being created. The standard web part 
page layouts are listed in Table  4-1 .  
 
 
 c. 
 Click the Create button to create the new page. 
 The new page is created. You will be navigated to it, and you can then configure the page by adding any 
needed web parts to it.

 Viewing Web Part Pages 
 Users having access to a site may not initially be aware of pages other than the site’s home page. Page 
visibility is dependent on the configuration of the navigation  within  the site and the inclusion of page 
references in the navigation areas. There are several methods that can be used to make pages accessible 
within SharePoint sites. Some of the most common approaches are the following:
• 
 Add a link to a page on the navigation bar of the site. 
• 
 Add a link to the Quick Launch menu of the site. 
• 
 Create a view on the home page to the web part pages available in the library 
containing the web part pages. 
 Editing Web Part Pages 
 Web part page editing consists of adding, editing, configuring, and deleting web parts from the pages. To edit 
web part pages, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the page you want to edit. 
 
 2. 
 On the web part page, select the Edit Page option from the Page ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 With the web part page in  Edit mode , select the Add a Web Part link in the zone 
where you want to add the web part, as shown in Figure  4-1 .

 Figure 4-2.  Web part page selection area 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
114
 The web part is added to the zone and can be configured. Configuring and managing web parts are 
discussed later in this chapter. With the items on the page, you can move them into the appropriate location 
by dragging the items within the  zone to the desired location.   
 Wiki Pages 
 A wiki page is another type of page that can be created within SharePoint sites.  Wiki pages are   managed 
within a site’s Site Pages library. While web part pages have zones where apps or web parts can be placed, 
wiki pages have zones that can contain apps, web parts, rich text content, references to images and videos, 
HTML elements (like tables and bulleted lists), and code (such as JavaScript) to further manipulate 
information within the page. These elements can be integrated within the page in any combination. 
 Create a wiki page when you want to provide full creative control of the page to content contributors 
within the site. Like web part pages, wiki pages have different page layouts available, and a page’s layout can 
be updated after the page has been created. 
 Creating Wiki Pages 
 Wiki pages are created within a site’s Site Pages library. This library is made available within a site by 
activating the Wiki Page Home Page feature (activating this feature is discussed in the “Creating Web Part 
Pages” section).  To  create a wiki page, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to create the wiki page.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Add a Page option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 In the Add a Page window, enter the name of the new page to create, and click 
the Create button. 
 The page is created. You are navigated to the page, and it is placed in Edit mode to allow changes to be made.  
 Editing Wiki Pages 
 An existing wiki page can be edited by navigating to the desired wiki page and then doing one of the 
following:
• 
 Selecting the Edit Page option from the Settings menu. 
• 
 Selecting the Edit option from the Page ribbon tab.    
 When a wiki page is edited, several characteristics can be managed, and elements can be added and 
configured. These elements include the following. 
 Managing the Page Layout 
 The layout of a wiki page can be edited after the page has been created. This is done to alter the  wiki   zone 
configuration to meet the needs of the page. To change the zone configuration for a page being edited, select 
the desired page layout from the Text Layout menu on the Format Text ribbon tab. The default wiki page 
layout includes those listed in Table  4-2 .  

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
115
 Editing Text 
 Wiki pages let you  enter text to be presented on the page. Rich text content is added to the page much as 
you would add content to a Word document. When text is added to the page, it is formatted with the format 
controls on the Format Text ribbon tab, as shown in Figure  4-3 . 
 Table 4-2.  Default  Wiki Part Page Layouts

 Figure 4-3.  Format  Text ribbon tab 
 Adding Tables 
 HTML tables are used to format page content into table structures and can be added to  wiki  pages. Tables 
are added to pages by editing a page, placing the cursor where the table should be inserted, and selecting the 
row and column configuration from the Table drop-down menu on the Insert tab of the ribbon, as shown in 
Figure  4-4 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
116
 Once the table is added to the page, the Design ribbon tab will be available allowing you to select the 
desired table layout and choose to show or hide grid lines for the table. The Table Layout ribbon tab can also 
be used to specify table and cell width, height, and layout properties. Tables are used to style and organize 
text and objects within a page to create the desired information layout.  
 Adding Pictures 
 You can  add   images to  wiki pages in order to show them within the page. Pictures can be added using any of 
three different approaches.
• 
 Approach 1: If the image to be displayed on the page is not yet in SharePoint and 
you want to upload the image and display it on the page, select the From Computer 
option from the Picture drop-down on the Insert ribbon tab (see Figure  4-4 ). You can 
then pick the file and the library where the file will be uploaded. The file is placed in 
the identified location and referenced on the page.  
• 
  Approach 2: If the image to be referenced is already located in SharePoint, you can 
select the From SharePoint option from the Picture drop-down on the Insert ribbon 
tab. When the Select an Asset window appears, you pick an item to reference from a 
location within the site collection. The selected item is referenced on the page. 
 
■ Note   When referencing images from within SharePoint, you should make sure that users visiting the page 
have at least Read permissions to the library where the image is located. The image reference will appear a 
broken image reference if the users do not have at least Read permissions. 
• 
 Approach 3: If the image to be displayed on the page is in a location outside the site 
collection, such as on another SharePoint site or some other web location, you can 
select the From Address option from the Picture drop-down menu on the Insert 
ribbon tab. You can then identify the URL of the image to reference. 
 Adding a Video or Audio File 
 Video and audio files can be added directly to a wiki page, allowing them to play in place on the page. As 
with pictures, video and audio  files can be added whether they are on your local computer or already in 
SharePoint or some other web-addressable location. Video and audio files are added to a page through one 
of the following approaches:
 Figure 4-4.  Insert ribbon tab 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
117
• 
   Approach 1: If the video or audio file is located outside the SharePoint environment—
on your local computer, for example—and needs to be uploaded to the environment, 
select the From Computer option from the Video and Audio drop-down on the Insert 
ribbon tab. Then select the file to upload and the library to upload it to. The file is 
uploaded to the designated location and referenced within the page.  
• 
 Approach 2: If the video or audio is in a web-accessible location and needs to be 
referenced from its current location through an embedded object reference, identify 
the file by selecting the Embedded option from the Video and Audio drop-down 
menu on the Insert ribbon tab. The Embed window will appear and you can enter 
the script or code necessary to reference the video. 
• 
 Approach 3: If the video or audio file is already stored in the SharePoint environment, 
reference it by selecting the From SharePoint option from the Video and Audio drop-
down menu of the Insert ribbon tab. Then select the file to reference. 
• 
 Approach 4: If the video or audio file exists in a web-accessible location and can be 
 referenced  through a standard URL, reference the file by using the From Address 
option of the Video and Audio drop-down menu of the Insert ribbon tab. Then enter 
the URL for the audio or video file. 
 Adding Links 
 Link references can be added to wiki pages to create references to other web resources, such as to items 
that exist in other locations within your SharePoint environment or to web resources external to it. Two 
approaches can be used to add  links to the page.
• 
 Approach 1: If the item you want to create a reference to exists in your SharePoint site 
collection, select the From SharePoint option from the Link drop-down of the Insert 
ribbon tab. Then select the item to reference, and the link is added to the page. 
• 
 Approach 2: If the item to reference does not exist within your SharePoint 
environment, reference it by selecting the From Address option from the Link 
drop-down of the Insert ribbon tab. Then enter the URL of the item and the text to 
display for the item. 
 Adding App Parts or Web Parts 
 App parts and web  parts add business functionality to SharePoint pages. You can add an app part or web 
part to a page by selecting either the App Part or Web Part option from the Insert ribbon tab. Then select the 
app part or web part to add to the page and click the Add button. Once on the page, the app or web part can 
be configured. Configuring app parts and web parts is discussed later in this chapter. 
 Adding Embedded Code 
 Just as standard web objects can be  embedded in SharePoint pages, if you want to add script logic to a page, 
you can embed your code directly in the page. To embed code, select the Embed Code option from the Insert 
ribbon tab, and then enter the code to be placed on the page. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
118
 Publishing Pages 
 The last type of page available in SharePoint is the publishing page. Publishing pages are only available 
in sites where the SharePoint Server Publishing site feature is active. Publishing pages contain web part 
zones, like web part pages, and rich text entry zones, like wiki pages. Use publishing pages when you want to 
control the  overall   layout of the page while providing page editors the ability to manage content within the 
structure. This type of page is commonly used to create standard templated pages, such as press releases or 
case studies, where you want a consistent layout for each of the items created. 
 Enabling Publishing Pages 
 In order to use publishing pages within a site, the SharePoint Server Publishing feature needs to be enabled. 
By default these features are available in publishing sites but need to be enabled in other site types. To 
enable the use of publishing pages in a site along with the other publishing capabilities of SharePoint, you 
first must ensure the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure site collection feature is active, and then 
verify the SharePoint Server Publishing site feature within the site where you want to use publishing pages. 
 To enable the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure site collection feature, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
 On the root site home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings 
menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Site Collection Features option from the Site 
Collection Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Collection Features page, select the Activate option for the SharePoint 
Server Publishing Infrastructure site collection feature. 
 The site collection feature is activated. With this done, you then need to activate the SharePoint Server 
Publishing feature within the site where you want to use publishing pages. To activate this feature, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to use publishing pages.  
 
 2. 
 From the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Manage Site Features option from the Site 
Actions section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Features page, select the Activate option for the SharePoint Server 
Publishing feature. 
 The now active  publishing features will allow you to create SharePoint publishing pages within the site.  
 Creating Publishing Pages 
 Publishing pages are managed within a site’s Pages library. This library  is   created when the  SharePoint 
Server Publishing site feature is enabled within the site. To create a new publishing page, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to create the page.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the New option from the Page ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Add a Page window, enter the name for the page, and click the Create 
button. 
 The page is created, and you are navigated to the new page in Edit mode.  

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
119
 Editing Publishing Pages 
 Users with Contribute rights or higher within the site can create and manage  publishing pages. To edit a 
publishing page do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the publishing page you want to edit. 
 
 2. 
 On the page, select the Edit Page option from the Settings menu or select the Edit 
option from the Page ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 Make your updates to the page, and once done, click the Save option from the 
Format Text or Page ribbon tabs. 
 
 4. 
 Publish the page by selecting the Publish option from the Publish ribbon tab. 
 Once the page is published, site users can see the changes made to the publishing page. Prior to this 
point only people having the ability to edit the page would be able to see the changes. 
 You can make several types of changes to publishing pages when editing them. Changes that can be 
made to these pages include determining page layout, creating and managing content, and configuring 
apps and web parts. Publishing pages include two types of zones, along with other elements focused on 
configuring web-based content. The zone types in a publishing page include the following:
• 
 Wiki zones allow management of rich text content, pictures, videos, apps, web parts, 
and other content (see the “Wiki Page” section). 
• 
 Web Part zones host web parts and app parts that. 
• 
 Page Image allows identification of an image to be displayed on a page in the 
identified location. 
• 
 Rollup Image allows identification of an image to be used in other site pages that 
reference the page using the content query web part or other page rollup tools. 
• 
 Summary Links is an area within the page containing one or more Summary Links 
web parts that allow for the creation and management of links.    
 The layout and inclusion of these zones depend on the page layout selected.  
 Changing a Page Layout 
 The page layout defines the number and  configuration   of zones within a page. When  a   publishing page is 
initially created, its layout is based on the  Body Only article page layout, which includes a content area and 
rollup image, as shown in Figure  4-5 . 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
120
 To change the page layout for a publishing page while viewing the page in Edit mode, select the desired 
page layout from the Page Layout drop-down menu on the Page ribbon tab. The available layouts include 
the following:
• 
 Article Pages
• 
 Body Only : This type of page includes a single content area covering the full 
page. It also contains a Rollup Image section, where you can reference an image 
used when the page is listed in other areas of the site (see Figure  4-5 ). 
• 
 Image on Left : This  page layout is similar to the Body Only layout in that it 
contains the full-page content area and the Rollup Image section. As Figure  4-6 
shows, this page also includes a page image that is listed in the upper-left area 
of the page. Article Date and Byline fields are also listed. 
 Figure 4-5.  Body Only article page  layout 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
121
• 
 Image on Right : This page layout and the Image on Left layout contain the same 
elements, the only difference being that the page image is located to the right of 
the content area instead of the left. 
• 
 Summary Links : This layout and the Image on Right layout contain the same 
structure, but in place of the page image is  a   Summary Links web part allowing 
management of a set of related links (see Figure  4-7 ).

 Enterprise Wiki Page
• 
 Basic Page : This layout is the only wiki page layout in the Publishing Page 
layouts. It includes  a  single wiki zone, like those described in the “Wiki Pages” 
section. The page also includes a rating option and has the ability to categorize 
the page. 
• 
 Error Page
• 
 Error : This type of page includes only a byline, a page content area, and a rollup 
image. 
• 
 Project Page
• 
 Basic Project Page : This layout includes a single wiki zone, with an area to the 
right that allows configuration of  metadata   about the project to be associated 
with the page (see Figure  4-9 ).

124
• 
 Redirect Page
• 
 Redirect : This type of  page has a field that identifies the URL to navigate to when 
the page is accessed. This page can be any URL and does not need to be located 
within SharePoint (see Figure  4-10 ).

• 
 Splash : This layout can include an image and a set of links, followed by a set of 
web part zones. 
• 
 Summary Links : This layout is similar to that of the Blank Web Part Page. It 
contains the  page  image area and the page content area. Below the content 
area, however, this layout also contains a pair of Summary Links web parts that 
can be used to configure links on the page. Below this pair of web parts is a set 
of additional web part zones for adding web parts and app parts to the page. 
 Checking In and Publishing Pages 
 The publishing pages library, created when the SharePoint Server Publishing site feature is activated, has 
versioning enabled by default. Versioning requires that you check  in pages after edits are made and publish 
the pages before changes become available to general site users. To check in a page that has been edited, do 
the following:
 
 1. 
 On the page, select the Check In option from the Page ribbon tab. 
 
 2. 
 In the Check In window, optionally enter a comment, and then click the 
Continue button. 
 The page is checked in as a minor version. For example, if the previous version of the page was 1.0, the 
new version will be 1.1. Minor versions of a page are available only to users with the ability to edit the page. 
In order to make the changes available to all site users, the page must be published. To publish a SharePoint 
page select the Publish option from the Publish ribbon tab. 
 Apps 
 In order to understand the difference between web parts and apps, you need to understand the different 
ways these two types of  components work . Web part solutions are deployed into an environment as either 
a  farm solution or a sandbox solution. Farm solutions have full trust within the SharePoint farm and are 
available for activation in all the site collections. Sandbox solutions, deployed into a specific site collection, 
are available for use only within that site collection. 
 Where web parts are deployed in the SharePoint farm to leverage resources, apps are stand-alone 
applications. This isolates their execution and allows them to run from their own web locations. SharePoint 
apps are made available from an online SharePoint App Store that is managed by Microsoft and from 
internal corporate app catalogs that can be managed from within your own environment. The next sections 
discuss how to manage and use apps within your SharePoint sites. 
 
■ Note   It is the responsibility of the SharePoint technical administrator to create app catalogs, configure 
connections to app catalogs, and set users’ security rights to download apps to use in the environment. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS

 Adding Apps to Your Site 
 For apps to be available within a SharePoint site, a site manager must first add the app to SharePoint for use. 
A site manager’s ability to add apps to  SharePoint  depends on the app management settings defined by the 
SharePoint technical administrator, who can select from the following options to determine site managers’ 
ability to manage apps.
• 
 Do not allow users to add apps: This option allows site managers to work only with 
apps that have already been added to the SharePoint environment for use. The only 
apps you can add to pages are the app parts for lists and libraries contained in the site.  
• 
 Allow users to request apps: This option allows site owners to access the app store to 
identify apps they are interested in adding. They can create a request for a desired 
app that then must be approved by a SharePoint technical administrator, who will 
download the app. This allows centralized management of apps and controls app 
purchases while letting site administrators identify and select apps they feel will 
meet their business needs. 
• 
 Allow users to add apps: This option allows site owners to access the app store 
and add apps to their SharePoint sites without the involvement of the SharePoint 
technical administrator. This gives site administrators complete control over app 
management in their sites. 
 Adding Apps Directly 
 As already discussed, your ability to add apps to SharePoint depends on settings configured by your 
 SharePoint  technical administrator. When the environment is configured to allow site owners to add apps, 
you can add apps from your corporate app repository or from the online SharePoint app store. To add an app 
from the online app store or from your corporate app repository, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to add the app. 
 
 2. 
 From the Settings menu of the site, select the Add an App option. 
 
 3. 
 On the Your Apps page (see Figure  4-12 ), select the SharePoint Store option from 
the Quick Launch area. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
128
 
 4. 
 On the  SharePoint Store page (see Figure  4-13 ), select the app to install. 
 
■ Caution    Some apps in the app store are free, but others must be purchased. Note the app’s cost before 
downloading it. Also, some apps are free previews of products that must later be purchased for continued use. 
 Figure 4-12.  Your Apps page 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
129
 
 5. 
 On an app’s  detail  page, review details about the app, including the description 
and user ratings, and then choose the Add It option to add the app. 
 
 6. 
 On the Market Place page, log on to the online store using your Microsoft 
account (this is the same as your Windows Live ID).  
 
 7. 
 On the Confirm That You Wish to Add the App page, click the Continue option. 
 
 8. 
 On the App Added confirmation screen, click the Return to Site option.     
 The app is added for use in your site from within the Your Apps page. As discussed earlier, you can then 
add the app to the appropriate SharePoint pages. 
 Requesting Apps to Add 
 When your SharePoint technical administrator has configured the environment so that site owners can 
request apps but not install apps directly, you will need to get the administrator’s approval for apps you want 
to install. To  request an  app, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to add the app. 
 
 2. 
 From the Settings menu of the site, select the Add an App option. 
 Figure 4-13.  SharePoint Store page

 3. 
 On the Your Apps page (see Figure  4-12 ), select the SharePoint Store option from 
the Quick Launch area. 
 
 4. 
 On the SharePoint Store page (see Figure  4-13 ), select the app to install. In this 
example, the World Clock and Weather app has been selected. 
 
 5. 
 On the app’s detail page, review the app’s details, and select the Request It 
option.  
 
 6. 
 In the App  Request window, identify the following:
 a. 
 Enter the user license details:specify the number of users the request is for 
or note that the request is for the entire organization. 
 b. 
  Enter a justification for the request. That is, identify why the app is needed. 
 c. 
 Click the Request button to complete the request. 
 Viewing Your App Requests 
 After you have placed a request for an app, you can track its status through the Site Content area  as  follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site collection where you made the request.  
 
 2. 
 From the Settings menu, select the Add an App option. 
 
 3. 
 On the Your Apps page, select the Your Requests option from the Quick Launch 
area. 
 
 4. 
 On the Your Requests page, view the details for the identified request.     
 Once the  SharePoint  technical administrator approves the request and adds the app, it is available for 
use in your SharePoint site. 
 Removing Apps 
 Apps that have been added to the SharePoint environment can later be removed if needed. To  remove an 
app, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site collection where you want to remove the app. 
 
 2. 
 On the home page of the site, select the Site Contents option. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Contents page click the  … option next to the app to remove it. 
 
■ Note   The default apps installed in the SharePoint environment will not have the  … option and cannot be 
removed. 
 
 4. 
 On the apps hover panel, select the  … option, and choose the Remove option.  
 
 5. 
 On the deletion confirmation screen, select the OK button to remove the 
application. 
 The app is removed, and you are returned to the Site Content page.

 Adding App Parts to Pages 
 Once apps have been added to the environment, they can be added to site pages. To add an  app   to a page, do 
the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the page where the app is to be added. 
 
 2. 
 On the page, select the Edit option to edit the page. 
 
 3. 
 Within the Edit mode of the page, select the location to place the app, and from 
the ribbon select the App Part option from the Insert tab. 
 
 4. 
 On the Parts list, select the app to add to the page, and then click the Add button. 
 The app part is added to the page, and you can configure it as necessary. App parts have different 
configurations depending on the configuration needs of the app, and they are managed and configured just as 
web parts are managed and configured. Managing web parts and app parts are discussed in the next section.  
 Web Parts 
 Like app parts, web parts add information views and  business functionality to SharePoint sites. Web parts 
can be used to show content in lists and libraries, implement process, interface with outside databases or 
systems, and provide any other application solution functionality. 
 Adding Web Parts to Pages 
 Web parts can be added to any of the pages discussed previously. They are added to either web part zones or 
wiki zones within SharePoint site pages. To add a web part to a  web part zone   in a page, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the web part or publishing page to be edited. 
 
 2. 
 Place the page into Edit mode (how to do this was explained earlier in this 
chapter). 
 
 3. 
 Click the Add a Web Part link in the web part zone where you want to add the 
web part.

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
135
 Removing Web Parts 
 Web parts listed on a page can be removed if they are no longer needed. Remove a  web part by  doing the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the page to be edited. 
 
 2. 
 Place the page into Edit mode. 
 
 3. 
 From the web part drop-down menu (see Figure  4-15 ), select the Delete option. 
 
 4. 
 In the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The web part is removed from the page. 
 Connecting Web Parts 
 Many of the web parts available in SharePoint can be connected to other web parts. This allows details in 
one web part to be used to filter content in another. An example of when this is useful is when you want to 
filter a library or list view based on the user viewing the page showing only items that the user created or 
modified. Web part  connections are made between provider web parts and consumer web parts. Provider 
web parts include the details to filter by and the consumer web part lists the content to be filtered. Creating 
a connection between these web parts allows the details from the provider to be made available to the 
consumer for use. 
 SharePoint filter web parts are specifically designed to act as provider web parts that can be connected 
to other web parts, such as list or library views, in order to filter them. For example, you could add a date 
filter to a page to filter the details in a calendar list to show just those items falling on the identified date. To 
create a connection between a provider and consumer web part, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the page containing the web parts to be connected.  
 
 2. 
 Place the page into Edit mode. 
 
 3. 
 On the provider web part, select the Connections option, then Send Filter Values 
To, and then the consumer web part. 
 
 4. 
 On the Web Part Dialog/Choose Connection page, click the Configure button. 
 
 5. 
 On the Web Part Dialog/Configure Connection page, select the column that the 
provider web part is to supply and the column that the consumer web part is to 
apply the connection against. Then click the Finish button.     
 The connection is established between the web parts, and the consumer web part is filtered based on 
 the provider web part details. 
 Exporting and Importing Web Parts 
 Once a web part has been added to a page and properly configured, you may want to export it  so  that it can 
be imported into other pages. Doing so allows an exact copy of the web part to be created within other pages. 
 Exporting a web part creates an XML file containing configuration details for the web part. To export a 
web part, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the page containing the web part to be exported. 
 
 2. 
 Place the page in Edit mode. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ PAGES, APPS, AND WEB PARTS
136
 
 3. 
 From the web part menu, select the Export option. 
 
 4. 
 On the open or save prompt, select the Save or Save As option to save the web 
part file. 
 An exported web part file can be imported into a SharePoint page, where it can be added to the 
information already displayed. The web part will be imported with the exact configuration it had when 
exported. To import a web part into a page, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the page where you want to add the web part.  
 
 2. 
 Place the page in Edit mode. 
 
 3. 
 Select to add a new web part to the page. 
 
 4.

Upload button. 
 
 6. 
 Select to add a web part to the page. 
 
 7. 
 On the web part selection screen from the Imported Web Parts category, select 
the uploaded web part and click the Add button.     
 The web part is added to the page. Use this approach when you need to upload the web part into a 
specific page. It is also possible to upload a web part so that it appears in one of the available web part 
configurations in the parts list. Over time, the web part can be added to multiple pages within your 
environment by uploading it into the Web Part Gallery. To import a web part to the Web Part Gallery, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
 Select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, click the Web Parts link under the Galleries section.  
 
 4. 
 On the Web Part Gallery page, select the Upload Document command from the 
New group on the Files ribbon tab. 
 
 5.

 Summary 
 In this chapter, we reviewed the different types of pages that can be created within SharePoint and 
demonstrated how to add, manage and remove these pages. We then looked at apps and web parts 
discussing what they are and how to add them to pages and configure them. We then reviewed the different 
web parts that are available by default within SharePoint Server Standard and Enterprise, describing what 
they are and how they are configured. 
 In the next chapter we will start discussing lists and libraries. We will look at how to create and manage 
these components, which are used to store content within SharePoint. We will review their structures and 
detail how to use key features such as columns and views.

 CHAPTER 5  
 Managing Lists and Libraries 
 SharePoint stores and manages documents and information in lists and libraries. Lists are used to organize 
and manage sets of data (such as tasks, contacts, and links), and libraries are used to store and manage 
documents (Microsoft Office files, PDFs, video files, images, etc.). There are a variety of lists and libraries 
available within SharePoint to allow you to manage all of the different types of information you need. 
 Lists are used when you need to store structured data, and they can be tailored to meet the specific 
needs of the individuals who will manage and consume the information. (The different lists available within 
SharePoint are discussed in Chapter   6 .) Libraries,  which can be considered a special type of list, are used 
to store files in SharePoint. Libraries and lists have many similarities in their creation and management. In 
this chapter the basic concepts related to managing lists and libraries are discussed, and Chapters   6 and   7 
expand on this discussion with a review of the different lists and libraries available in SharePoint and how to 
manage content within them. 
 As was just mentioned, in structure and approach to navigation, SharePoint lists and libraries are very 
similar. Figure  5-1  shows this  structure . When you access a list or library in a site, you navigate to its default 
view. Once within the list or library, the following elements are available:
• 
  A set of links appears at the top of the page that lets you create new items and, if you 
are in a library, upload a document and sync and share resources. 
• 
 A set of views is listed below the new link. You can click on the name of any listed 
view to update the display of the list or library content based on the definition of that 
view. You can also modify the view or create a new view from this area as well. 
• 
  A search box, located next to the view list, allows you to query the list or library by 
entering text into the search box and returning the items containing the entered text. 
• 
  The content display area, which sits below the listing of views and the search box, 
presents the content of the list or library as defined by the selected view. From here 
you can work with the content (as discussed in Chapters   6 and   7 ). 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
170
 Creating Lists and Libraries 
 When you create a new site, it will include a default sets of lists and libraries based on the definition of the 
selected site template. We discussed creating site templates in Chapter   3 . However, you may need to  create   
additional lists and libraries once a site is created in order to manage needed information in your site. 
 To create a list or library in a SharePoint site, you must have the Manage Lists right, which by default is 
available as part of the Edit, Design, Manage Hierarchy, and Full Control permission levels. To create a new 
list or library in a site, do the following:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the site where you want to create the new list or library. 
 
 2. 
  Select the Site Contents option from the Quick Launch or Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Contents page, select the Add an App option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Your Apps page (see Figure  5-2 ), from the Apps You Can Add section, 
select the type of list or library to be created. 
 Figure 5-1.  Library view  page 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
171
 
 5. 
 In the Add window, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
  If you want to use the default setup—which includes no description and, for 
libraries, no versioning—enter the name for the new list or library and click 
the Create button. 
 
 
 b. 
  If you want to change the default settings for the list or library being created, 
do the following:
  
 
 i. 
 Select the Advanced Options link. 
  
 
 ii.  On the new screen, enter a name for the new list, enter an optional 
description, and for libraries, specify whether the library will store 
versions and what the default document template will be. Then click the 
Create button. 
 The new list or library is created, and you are returned to the Site Contents page. 
 Figure 5-2.  Your Apps  page 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
172
 Deleting Lists and Libraries 
 Whether a list or library was available by default when the site was created or was added later by you or 
someone else, you can  delete any lists or libraries available within the site. You might do this if you created 
a list in error or want to remove irrelevant lists or libraries to keep users from using them. To delete a list or 
library within a site, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library to be deleted. 
 
 2. 
 From the List or Library ribbon tab, select the List or Library Settings option 
(see Figure  5-3 ). 
 Figure 5-3.  Library ribbon tab 
 
■ Note   In some lists, the List ribbon tab is named differently. For example, in lists created from the Calendar 
list template, the List tab is named Calendar. 
 
 3. 
 On the list’s or library’s Settings page, in the Permissions and Management 
section, click the Delete This Document Library or the Delete This List option. 
 
 4. 
 On the  deletion confirmation screen, click the OK button. 
 The list or library is deleted, and you are taken to the Site Contents page. Deleted lists and libraries are 
moved to the site’s recycle bin and, if necessary, can be restored as long as they remain there (the recycle bin 
is discussed in detail in Chapter   3 ). 
 Managing List and Library Properties 
 There are several manageable list and library settings that can be used to determine how the list  or library is 
displayed. These settings are managed through the Name, Description, and Navigation Settings section. To 
manage these settings, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list’s or library’s Settings page. 
 
 2. 
 On the Settings page, select the List Name, Description, and Navigation option 
from the General Settings section. 
 
 3. 
 On the General Settings page, the following areas can be managed:
 
 
 a. 
 In the Name and Description section, the name of the list or library can be 
updated. This is the name used to reference the item in the site. You can also 
update the list or library’s optional description. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
173
 
 
 b. 
  In the Navigation section, you can specify whether the list or library is to be 
included in the Quick Launch area of the site. 
 
 
 c. 
 Once all information has been updated, click the Save button. 
 The information is updated,  and you are returned to the Settings page. 
 
■ Note   Changing the name of a list changes only the display name, not the underlying system name 
SharePoint uses for the list. While this does not affect normal use of the list, it matters to developers referencing 
the list through code. 
 Metadata Columns 
 Both lists and libraries allow for the creation of columns of various types to manage information within 
SharePoint. For lists, the columns store the information being managed. For documents, the columns act as 
metadata for a document providing details used to describe the document which can be used to organize, 
sort, search, filter, and view items by. 
 Available Columns 
 Several different types of columns  are available in SharePoint. The following are the types of columns 
available and how they can be used. 
 Single Line of Text 
 The  Single Line of Text column is used to store standard text in a single row. Use this column type when 
you want people adding and working with documents or list data to have complete control over the value 
entered. It is limited to a single row of text that can contain only up to 255 characters of information. As 
Figure  5-4  shows, this column is presented as a text box into which text is entered.  
 Figure 5-4.  Single Line of Text field 
 The Single Line of Text field has the following properties:
• 
 Column Name : Identifies the name of the column in the list or library. This is the 
name presented when you view or edit items. 
• 
 Description : Lists optional description text that, if entered, appears below the column 
when editing the details. The description field is used when more information 
is needed to help individuals editing the list understand the purpose or type of 
information expected to be entered. 
• 
 Require That This Column Contains Information : Specifies whether the column must 
contain information in order to save the item. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
174
• 
 Enforce Unique Values : Specifies whether the value entered must be different from 
the value in this column for all other items in the list or library.  
• 
 Maximum Number of Characters : Determines the number of characters that can be 
entered into the field (the maximum is 255). 
• 
 Default Value : Specifies whether the column is to automatically contain a value when 
a new item is created. This option also determines whether the default value will be 
text identified in the default value text box or will be calculated based on a formula.  
• 
 Column Validation : Allows entry of a formula used to validate information entered 
in the field  to ensure it contains appropriate data. This section also allows entry of a 
message presented to the user to identify column data entry requirements. Column 
validation is discussed in detail in Chapter   6 . 
 Multiple Lines of Text 
 The  Multiple Lines of Text field is used to store the following:
• 
 Larger quantities of text than the 255 characters Single Line of Text fields allow 
• 
 Multiple rows of information making it useful for addresses or situations when 
multiple paragraphs need to be entered 
• 
 Richly formatted text, including text with images, colored or bolded text, tables and 
more 
 This column is represented as a multirow text entry field. Depending on the options selected, it can 
provide additional ribbon tabs, called Format Text and Insert, that contain options that allow management 
of text formatting within the column and enable insertion of additional objects such as images and videos. 
Figure  5-5 shows the standard edit view for a Multiple Lines of Text field. 
 Figure 5-5.  Multiple Lines of Text field

 Adding Columns 
 Now that all of the different columns available within SharePoint lists and libraries have been discussed and 
the options available to configure them have been reviewed, we can now discuss how to add these columns 
to a list or library. To add a  column , do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to create the column. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Create Column option from the 
Manage Views section of the List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Create Column screen, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 In the Column Name field, enter the name for the column. 
 
 
 b. 
 In the Type section, select the field type for the new column. 
 
 
 c. 
 In the Additional Column Settings section, update the column details. The 
details to configure are dependent on the column type selected and are 
described in detail in the Available Columns section. 
 
 4. 
 Once all the information has been entered, click the OK button. 
 The column is added, and you are returned to the list or library view. 
 Editing Columns 
 Existing columns that have been added to a list or library can be edited. Editing columns can include 
changing the display name, type, or other column settings. To change column  details   in a list or library, do 
the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to edit a column.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
185
 
 3. 
 In the Columns section on the list’s or library’s Settings page, select the column 
to update. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit Column page, make any needed updates to the column properties 
and click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The changes are saved, and you are returned to the list’s or library’s Settings page. 
 
■ Note   You can change a column’s type only to certain other types. If a column type is changed, you will lose 
data from the column when the data is not supported by the new column type selected. For example, changing 
a Single Line of Text column to a Number column will result in the loss of any values that contain characters 
other than numbers. 
 Deleting Columns 
 Columns that were added to lists or libraries can be deleted if they are no longer needed. To  delete an 
existing column, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to delete a column. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Columns section on the Settings page, select the column to delete. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit Column page, click the Delete button.  
 
 5. 
 In the delete confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 You are returned to the Settings page, and the selected column is deleted. It should be noted that not all 
columns in a list can be deleted. Columns such as Title, Created, Created By, Modified, and Modified By will 
not include the Delete button on the Edit Column page. 
 
■ Caution    When a column is deleted, all of the data saved in the column is deleted as well. This information 
is not placed in the recycle bin, so it cannot be restored if it was deleted in error. 
 Changing the Order of Columns 
 The order  of  columns in a list or library determines their order on the item’s view and edit properties pages. 
To edit column order for a list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to reorder the columns.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Columns section on the Settings page, click the Column Ordering link. 
 
 4. 
 On the Change Column Ordering page, change the Position from Top values for 
the listed items to place them in the desired order, and once all items are in the 
proper order, click the OK button to save the order. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
186
 The column order is updated, and you are returned to the Settings page for the list or library. The 
item order does not affect the order of items within list or library views, only the View Properties and Edit 
Properties pages. Views and how to manage columns in them is discussed later in this chapter. 
 Setting Column Indexes 
 Lists and libraries can contain thousands of items. The more items a list or library contains, the longer 
displaying the list and performing actions such as filtering and sorting of the items in it will take. Creating 
indexes  against  columns that are frequently sorted against or filtered on can improve the performance of 
these activities. In SharePoint 2016, there are indexes that are automatically created to help address access 
to lists with a large number of items within them. That said, it is still possible to create additional indexes. To 
create an index against a list or library column, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to update column indexes. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Columns section on the Settings page, click the Indexed Columns option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Indexed Columns page, click the Create a New Index link.  
 
 5. 
 On the Edit Index page, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 In the Primary Column section, select the column against which the index is 
to be created. 
 
 
 b. 
 In the Secondary Column section, select, if you want, an optional second 
column for the index. 
 
 
 c. 
 Click the Create button to create the new index. 
 The index is created, and you are returned to the Indexed Columns page. 
 Configuring Keywords 
 Enterprise keyword columns can be added to lists and libraries to make searching for and finding list items 
easier. The  keyword fields will be populated with document tags as they are created. To add an enterprise 
keywords field to a list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to configure the keywords. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Enterprise Metadata and Keywords Settings 
option from the Permissions and Management section. 
 
 4. 
 In the Enterprise Keywords section on the Enterprise Metadata and Keywords 
Settings page, check the box next to the Add an Enterprise Keywords Column 
to This List and Enable Keyword Synchronization option, and then click the OK

 Working with Views 
 Views present information in lists and libraries to users accessing those lists and libraries. Multiple views 
can be created to support different uses in the list or library. When you first navigate to a list or library, the 
default view appears. (A list can have multiple views to select from but only one default view.) Figure  5-1 
shows a standard document library view, the All Documents view. 
 Views enable you to organize columns into structures that meet information access needs and allow 
you to filter and sort information to limit and organize it. You can also run mathematical operations against 
the columns in a view to include sums, averages, and the like within it. As you will see, a view can be public 
or  private . A public view is available to all site users, whereas a private view is available only to the user that 
created it. 
 Types of Views 
 Six different types of views can be created against SharePoint lists and libraries. Discussion of each of these 
views and their layouts follows. 
 Standard View 
 The  standard view is the most commonly used type of view in SharePoint. Create a standard view when you 
want to list items in a list or library in a tabular structure (see Figure  5-1 ). This type of view allows grouping, 
filtering, sorting, and styling of the information presented. The view can be used when navigating within the 
list or library or when placing the list or library display on a SharePoint page. People viewing the information 
will also be able to sort and filter the details displayed. The standard view supports the following:
• 
 Identifying the list or library columns to be included in the view. 
• 
 Identifying up to two columns to sort the items by. 
• 
 Specifying filter criteria for the view to allow the information displayed to be limited 
based on column values. 
• 
 Identifying columns to group the presented information by.  
• 
 Selecting  columns  to sum, average, or count.  
• 
 Identifying the style for presentation of the information. 
 Datasheet View 
 The  datasheet view provides an Excel-like display of the information in the list (see Figure  5-15 ). This view 
allows you to make multiple updates to the information more easily by allowing the changes to be made 
directly against the view instead of needing to navigate to the items’ edit pages. This view gives those 
accessing it the ability to reorder and hide columns, as well as assist with data access and management. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
188
 The datasheet view allows configuration of many of the options the standard view allows, including 
the following:
• 
 Identifying the list or library columns to be included in the view. 
• 
 Identifying up to two columns to sort the items by. 
• 
 Specifying filter criteria for the view to allow information to be displayed based on 
the column values. 
• 
 Selecting columns to sum, average, or count. 
 Calendar View 
 The  calendar  view is used when the information to display needs to be made available in a calendar. This 
view requires that the columns in the list or library include date fields for the start date and end date for 
placement on the calendar, as well as fields that can be used as the title of the item on the calendar. This view 
is most commonly used with lists created from the calendar template, but it can also be valuable in task lists, 
issues lists, and others containing date-dependent information. The calendar view allows the following:
• 
 Specifying the date fields used to position the item on the calendar.  
• 
 Viewing titles with the columns from the list used to represent the item in the 
calendar view specified. 
• 
 Specifying a default scope that identifies whether the calendar layout initially shows 
the day, week, or month. 
• 
 Setting any filter criteria for the view to allow information to be displayed based on 
the column values. 
 Figure 5-15.  Datasheet view 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
189
 The  calendar view  allows presentation of information in monthly, weekly, and daily displays, any of 
which can be selected from the Calendar ribbon tab. The monthly display shown in Figure  5-16 shows a 
single month of information, defaulted to the current month. A month selector, found in the Quick Launch 
area, can be used to select the desired month. 
 Figure 5-16.  Calendar in monthly view 
 The weekly view shows details for a single week. When first accessed, the weekly view shows the current 
week. The Quick Launch area includes the same selector shown in the monthly view, but now it is used to 
select the week to display. Figure  5-17 shows a weekly calendar display.  
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
190
 The daily  view shows items for a single day. When first accessed, the view defaults to the current day. As 
with the other views, a selector in the Quick Launch area allows selection of a day to view. Figure  5-18 shows 
the daily view for the calendar. 
 Figure 5-17.  Calendar in weekly view 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
191
 Gantt View 
 In the  Gantt view  , the list details are displayed in a timeline view similar to a Microsoft Project display. Date 
fields are required to identify start and end dates for items presented in the Gantt chart. This view is used to 
track activity over time and is most commonly used with task lists. Figure  5-19 shows the Gantt view. 
 Figure 5-18.  Calendar in daily view 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
192
 Configuration of this view requires configuration of the following information:
• 
 Columns to display in the view. 
• 
 Gantt columns, including the columns needed to build and display the Gantt 
chart, among which are a title for the item on the chart, start and end dates, and 
(optionally) percentage complete and predecessor details. 
• 
 Sorting information, to order the items listed in the view.  
• 
 Filter details, to refine the list of items included in the view. 
• 
 Choice of columns by which to group the presented information. 
• 
 Columns  to  sum, average, or count. 
• 
 Choice of a style for the presentation of the information. 
• 
 Specification whether the number of items presented should be limited. 
 Access View 
 The  Access view opens Microsoft Access with a connection to a list letting you create forms and reports 
based on the information in the list. This view is not available for documents. Access view is used to create a 
highly formatted representation of information or to permit easy printing of the list details. To see reports or 
forms created through access view, a user needs access to the Access database file in which they were saved. 
 Figure 5-19.  Gantt view 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
193
 The Access view types available include the following:
• 
 Form : Creates an Access form that allows for the creation and edit of individual list 
items. 
• 
 Split Form : Like the form view, the split form view allows for adding and editing 
individual list items but this view also includes a data sheet representation of the 
items in the list. 
• 
 Multiple Items : Creates a form that simultaneously displays the details for multiple 
items in the list. 
• 
 Datasheet : Creates a standard datasheet view of the items in the list.  
• 
 PivotChart : Creates a chart view representing the details in the list.  
 When selecting to create an Access view, Microsoft Access will be opened on the local computer and 
connected to the associated list. The Create Access View window is presented allowing for the selection of 
the type of Access view to create, as shown in Figure  5-20 . 
 Figure 5-20.  The Create Access View window 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
194
• 
 PivotTable : Creates a PivotTable containing the details in the list.  
• 
 Report : The Report view type allows for the creation of a basic Access report used to 
present the data in the list. 
 Custom Views in SharePoint Designer 
 Choosing the Custom View in SharePoint  Designer option lets you use SharePoint Designer to create a 
view. Use SharePoint Designer to create a view when you need a more complex layout of information than 
is possible with the other view types. For example, your view may need to include conditional formatting, 
complex styling, complex filtering, or other advanced information layouts. Figure  5-21 shows the screen 
displayed when the Custom View in SharePoint Designer option is selected. Enter the name for the new 
view, and then work in SharePoint Designer to configure it. 
 Figure 5-21.  SharePoint Designer custom view 
 
■ Note   SharePoint Designer 2013 is used in conjunction with SharePoint 2016. There is no SharePoint 
Designer 2016 version. 
 Creating Views 
 To create a new view, first determine the type of view that will best meet your needs. You base this decision 
on the purpose of the view, and how you want people accessing it to use the information it displays. Once 
you decide the type of view to create, determine which details from the list or library you want to display in 
the view and in what order the columns should appear. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
195
 
■ Note   The order of columns in the list itself does not affect the order of columns in the view. 
 When selecting columns to include in the view, you are shown the standard columns that are part of 
the list or library, any custom columns you may have added, and a set of special columns that are made 
available automatically. The  special columns include the following:
• 
 Attachments : Used to add a column that shows whether an attachment is associated 
with the list. This column is available only in lists that support attachments. 
• 
 Checked Out To : The user to whom the item is checked out if the item is in a checked-out 
status (available only for items, such as documents, supporting checkout).  
• 
 Content Type : The name of the content type the item is based on. 
• 
 Copy Source : The URL of the original source document available in document 
libraries and used when documents are moved within SharePoint. 
• 
 Created : The date and time the list or library item was originally created.  
• 
 Created By : The user who created the item. 
• 
 Edit (Link to Edit Item) : An icon that, when clicked, will open the Edit window for the 
corresponding list item or document. 
• 
 File Size : Size of the document. This column is only available in libraries. 
• 
 Folder Child Count : The number of folders contained in the current folder of the list 
or library. 
• 
 ID : The unique identifier for the item in the list or library.  
• 
 Item Child Count : The number of items contained in the current folder of the list or 
library. 
• 
 Modified : The date and time the list or library item was last modified. 
• 
 Modified By : The user who last modified the item. 
• 
 Type (Icon Linked to Document) : An icon representing the type of item that, when 
clicked, will open the associated list item or document. 
• 
 Version : The version number of the item. When versioning is not enabled against the 
list or library, the version number always remains at 1.0. 
 Once the columns are selected and properly ordered, decide how you want the information in the list 
or library sorted. Sorting can involve one or two columns in the list or library you to select the primary sort 
order and one level of subsort ordering. Sort order can be either ascending or descending. 
 Next, determine whether the view should include all items in the list or library or use conditions to 
limit the items displayed. To filter items, determine the filtering criteria. Any combination of column criteria 
available in the list or library can be used. 
 Once the filter criteria are specified, the next decision is determining whether the information should 
be grouped by any of the listed columns. Grouping involves a hierarchical display of the  information   based 
on the selected columns. You can group by a single column or by two columns and you can choose to show 
these groups either expanded or collapsed. The expanded grouping keeps all items visible within the view 
and makes them appear to be contained under the group by columns. The collapsed grouping shows only 
the group by values, you must click a plus icon next to a group value to reveal the contained items. With all of 
these decisions made, you can create the views you need for your lists and libraries.

 Creating Standard Views 
 To create a new standard view, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to create the view. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Create View option from the List or 
Library ribbon tab, as shown in Figure  5-22 . 
 Figure 5-23.  View  Type page 
 Figure 5-22.  List ribbon  tab 
 
 3. 
 On the View Type page, select the Standard View option from the Choose a View 
Type section, or select an existing standard view to use as the starting layout for 
the new view in the Start from an Existing View section, as shown in Figure  5-23 . 
 
 4. 
 On the Create View page, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 In the  Name  section, enter the name for the new view. This name will 
identify the view in the view selection area of the ribbon and in the views 
listing at the top of the view page. Also, specify whether the view should be 
the default view, the view seen when the list or library is initially accessed. 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
197
 
 
 b. 
 In the Audience section, specify whether this will be a personal view 
(available only to the person creating it) or a public view (available to all 
visitors to the list or library). 
 
 
 c. 
 In the Columns section, select the columns from the list or library to display, 
and identify the order to display the columns in.  
 
 
 d. 
 In the Sort section, optionally identify the primary and secondary sort 
columns, and specify whether the information’s sort order is ascending or 
descending. You can also specify whether all items, including folders, should 
be sorted in the specified order or listed before the other content items. 
 
 
 e. 
 In the Filter section, optionally define filtering criteria for the items. When 
specifying criteria, for each filter rule identify the column to filter against 
and the filtering conditions. You can specify multiple columns to filter on 
and decide whether the filters are joined with AND conditions (that the 
content presented must satisfy both listed conditions) or OR conditions 
(that either item condition will satisfy the filter). The conditions available for 
use with filters include the items shown in Table   5-1 . 
 Table 5-1.  View  Filter Conditions 
 Condition 
 Description 
 Is Equal To 
 The value of the column must equal the condition text entered. 
 Is Not Equal To 
 The value of the column cannot equal the condition text entered. 
 Is Greater Than 
 The value of the column must be greater than the value entered in the 
condition text. This condition is primarily used with number and date 
columns. 
 Is Less Than 
 The value of the column must be less than the value entered in the condition 
text. Like the Is Greater Than condition, this condition is primarily used with 
number and date columns. 
 Is Greater Than or Equal To 
 The value of the column must be greater than or the same as the value 
entered in the condition text. 
 Is Less Than or Equal To 
 The value of the column must be less than or the same as the value entered 
into the condition text. 
 Begins With 
 The column value starts with the text entered as the condition text. This 
condition is primarily used with text values. For example, if “butter” is the 
text entered, a column value starting with this text, such as “butterfly” or 
“buttercup”, will be included, but a field value such as “coco butter” will not 
be included. 
 Contains 
 The condition text can be found somewhere within the column value. 
This condition is primarily used with text values. For example, if “butter” 
is the text entered, column values containing this text, such as “butterfly”, 
“buttercup”, and “coco butter”, will be included. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
198
 
 
 f. 
  In the Tabular Value section, specify whether you want to allow check boxes 
for the items. Check boxes (enabled by default) allow selection of multiple 
items when bulk management tasks are performed. List and library item 
management is discussed in Chapters   6 and   7 . 
 
 
 g. 
 In the Group By section, specify whether the information in the view should 
be grouped by any column values (one or two levels of column grouping 
can be chosen). As part of specifying the grouping, identify whether to sort 
the grouping items in ascending or descending order. Also specify whether 
grouped items are collapsed and must be expanded to show items under 
the group or are expanded by default. Finally in this section, identify the 
number of items to appear per page in the view. 
 
 
 h. 
  In the Totals section, specify whether any columns are to have a total value 
calculated and displayed within the view. The type of totaling performed 
depends on the type of data contained in the column. Table   5-2 shows the 
type of totaling that can be performed. 
 Table 5-2.  Totaling  Types for Columns

descending. You can also specify whether all items, including folders, should 
be sorted in the specified order or listed before the other content items. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
201
 
 
 e. 
 In the Filter section, optionally define filtering criteria for the items. When 
specifying filter criteria, for each filter rule identify the column to filter 
against and the filtering conditions. You can specify  multiple   columns to 
filter on and decide whether the filters are joined with AND conditions (the 
content presented must satisfy both listed conditions) or OR conditions 
(either item condition will satisfy the filter). The conditions available for use 
with filters include the items identified in Table   5-1 . 
  
 
 f. 
  In the Totals section, specify whether any columns are to have a total value 
calculated and displayed within the view. The type of totaling performed 
depends on the type of data contained in the column. Table   5-2 shows the 
type of totaling that can be performed. 
 
 
 g. 
 In the Folders section, specify whether folders will be represented in the 
view. When selected this option lists folders within the list or library and 
shows the items contained in the folder when it is clicked. Alternatively, 
choosing to show all items without folders will display all list or library items 
as if the folders did not exist. That is, all items will appear as if they reside at 
the root in the library. 
 
 
 h. 
 In the Item Limit section, specify how many items will appear on a single 
page in the view and whether the view is to display only that many items or

grouped items are collapsed and must be expanded to show items under 
the group or are expanded by default. Finally in this section, identify the 
number of items to appear per page in the view. 
 
 
 h. 
  In the Totals section, specify whether any columns are to have a total value 
calculated and displayed within the view. The type of totaling performed 
depends on the type of data contained in the column. Table  5-2 shows the 
type of totaling that can be performed. 
 
 
 i. 
 In the Style section, identify the layout that will govern the display of items 
in the view. Table  5-3 lists the styles available. 
 
 
 j. 
 In the Folders section, specify whether folders will be represented in the 
view. When selected, this option lists folders within the list or library and 
shows the items contained in a folder when it is clicked. Alternatively, 
choosing to show all items without folders will display all list or library 
items as if the folders did not exist. That is, all items will appear as if they are 
contained at the root in the library. 
 
 
 k. 
 In the Item Limit section, specify how many items will appear on a single 
page in the view and whether the view is to display only that many items  or 
 that many items at a time, with paging. By default, a view will show batches 
of 30 items at a time. 
 
 
 l. 
 Once all the appropriate information is entered, click the OK button. 
 The view is created, and you are navigated to the library or list view you created.

 Creating Views in SharePoint Designer 
 As mentioned earlier, new views can also be created through SharePoint Designer to take advantage of its 
advanced configurations for view, such as more highly customized layouts and conditional formatting. 
 To create a new view through  SharePoint Designer , do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where the view is to be created.  
 
 2. 
 From the List or Library ribbon tab on the list or library view page, select the 
Create View option. 
 
 3. 
 On the View Type page, select the Custom View in SharePoint Designer option. 
 
 4. 
 In SharePoint Designer in the Create New List View window, enter the name of 
the new view, specify whether it should be the default view, and click the OK 
button. 
 
 5. 
 In SharePoint Designer on the list or library screen in the Views section, select 
the newly created view. 
 
 6. 
 In SharePoint Designer on the View page, set up the view as appropriate. 
 The new  view  will be available in SharePoint when you access the list or library.  
 Access View 
 Microsoft Access can be used to create forms and reports from lists and libraries. To take advantage of 
Microsoft Access for reporting on list and library information, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where the view is to be created.  
 
 2. 
 From the List or Library ribbon tab on the list or library view page, select the 
Create View option. 
 
 3. 
 On the View Type page, select the Access View option. 
 Access will open and connect to the selected list or library. You can then create any needed forms or 
reports against the list or library. 
 Editing Existing Views 
 Existing list and library  views can be edited to alter layouts and settings. Views can be edited in SharePoint or 
SharePoint Designer. Edit a view in SharePoint Designer to alter filtering conditions or change the display in 
ways not available in the standard SharePoint view management options. 
 To edit list and library views in SharePoint, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the view you want to edit.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the view you want to edit from the view list.  
 
 3. 
 On the list or library view page, click on the Modify View option from the List or 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit View page, update the view details as needed, and once done, click 
the OK button. 
 The view will be edited, and you will be navigated to the updated view. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
205
 As mentioned, you can also edit existing views in SharePoint Designer. Doing so allows you to take 
advantage of SharePoint Designer’s extended view management capabilities, even on views initially created 
within SharePoint itself. To edit an existing view in SharePoint Designer, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the view you want to edit.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the view from the view list that you want to 
edit. 
 
 3. 
 On the list or library view page, click the down arrow next to the Modify View 
option, and choose the Modify in SharePoint Designer (Advanced) option from 
the List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 4. 
 In SharePoint Designer, make any needed changes to the view and save the 
changes. 
 The view is  updated  based on the changes made. 
 Delete Existing Views 
 You can delete existing views for lists and libraries (except for the default view). To  delete   a view defined as 
the default view, first select a different view as the default, and then the former default view can be deleted. 
To delete a view that is not the default view in SharePoint, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the view you want to delete. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the view from the view list that you want to 
edit. 
 
 3. 
 On the list or library view page, click on the Modify View option from the List or 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit View page, click the Delete button.  
 
 5. 
 In the delete confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The view is deleted, and you are returned to the list or library. 
 RSS Feed Settings 
 An RSS feed (Really Simple Syndication) is a way of publishing information in a standard format that can be 
consumed by RSS readers. SharePoint allows  you to publish lists and libraries as RSS feeds consumable by 
RSS reader programs. Publishing lists and libraries as RSS feeds lets you make announcement lists and other 
information available on mobile phones and other devices, in a program such as Outlook, and on alternative 
web solutions and interfaces. 
 To configure RSS settings within a SharePoint list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you need to configure RSS settings. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the RSS Settings option from the Communications 
section. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
206
 
 4. 
 On the Modify RSS Settings page, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 In the List RSS section, specify whether the list should support RSS. 
 
 
 b. 
 In the RSS Channel Information section, specify whether Multi-Line of Text 
fields should be truncated and specify the title, description and image to be 
used to refer to the list through the RSS feed. 
 
 
 c. 
 When working with libraries, in the Document Options section specify 
whether file enclosures should be included in the feed and if RSS items 
should be linked directly to their files. 
 
 
 d. 
 In the Columns section, select the columns from the list or library to expose 
through the RSS feed and the order in which those columns will appear in 
the feed. 
 
 
 e. 
 In the Item Limit section, specify the maximum number of items and days of 
information to include in the feed. 
 
 
 f. 
 Click the OK button  to  save the RSS details. 
 When a list or library is configured to support RSS, each view within it has an RSS version. RSS views are 
accessed by navigating to the associated list view and selecting the RSS Feed option from the List or Library 
ribbon tab. 
 Managing List and Library Permissions 
 Chapter   3 discussed managing security within sites and how to control who has access to sites and the 
content they contain, including their lists and libraries. To further refine security within a SharePoint site, 
you can change permissions of individual lists and libraries. Managing permissions directly against a list 
or library causes security for the list and its content to be driven by the updated permissions instead of the 
overall site permissions. You will want to change a list’s or library’s permissions when access to it needs to 
be more restricted than access to the site or when individuals that need to edit its content and those that can 
edit other site content are different. When changing list permissions, if you configure them such that some 
site users lack access to the list, references to it within the site will also be unavailable to those users. That is, 
the list will appear not to exist to users without access rights to it. 
 Updating List and Library Inheritance Settings 
 To manage list or library security directly, first update the permission inheritance  settings  . Removing 
permission inheritance for a list or library allows its security to be managed separately from that of the site as 
a whole. To update this permission inheritance for a list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library whose permission inheritance is to be updated. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Permissions for This Document Library or 
Permissions for This List option. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
207
 
 4. 
 On the Permissions page, update the list or library inheritance options as follows:
 
 
 a. 
  If the list or library currently inherits permissions from the site, do the 
following:
 
 
 
 i. 
 On the Permissions ribbon tab, select the Stop Inheriting Permissions 
option.  
 
 
 
 ii. 
 In the confirmation window, click the OK button. 
 
 
 b. 
  If the list or library does not currently inherit permissions from the site, do 
the following:
 
 
 
 i. 
 On the Permissions ribbon tab, select the Delete Unique Permissions 
option.  
 
 
 
 ii. 
 In the confirmation window, click the OK button. 
 The  permission inheritance settings are updated, and the permissions page is updated accordingly. If 
you stopped permission inheritance, a copy of the permissions applied to the site are made for the list or 
library, and the permission management options are made available in the list’s or library’s Permissions 
page. If you deleted unique permissions, the list or library permissions are marked as inherited and any 
changes made to the permissions of the list or library are lost. 
 Changing List and Library Permissions 
 When a list or library does not inherit permissions,  update   its permissions by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you  want to update permissions. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Permissions for This List (or Document Library) 
option from the Permissions and Management section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Permissions page, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 To add permissions:
 
 
 
 i. 
 Select the Grant Permissions option from the Permissions ribbon tab.  
 
 
 
 ii. 
 In the Share window, enter the user’s name or e-mail and select the 
user from the type-ahead list. If permissions to be added are other than 
edit, click the Show Options link to show permission levels, and choose 
the appropriate ones from the drop-down. Then click the Share button. 
 
 
 b. 
  To edit existing user or group permissions:
 
 
 
 i. 
 Click the box next to the user or group whose permissions are to be 
updated, and then choose the Edit User Permissions option from the 
Permissions ribbon tab. 
 
 
 
 ii. 
 On the Edit Permissions page, select the appropriate permission levels, 
and then click the OK button. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
208
 
 
 c. 
 To delete existing user or group permissions:
 
 
 
 i. 
 Click the box next to the user or group whose permissions are to be 
deleted, and then select the Remove User Permissions option from the 
Permissions ribbon tab. 
 
 
 
 ii. 
 In the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button. 
 The user  permissions for the list or library are appropriately updated.   
 File Plan Reporting 
 Lists and libraries come with the ability to generate file plan reports. A report lists details about the list or 
library and its content. Figure  5-24 shows a standard  file plan report  .  
 Figure 5-24.  File plan report 
 The statistics presented in a list or library file plan report include key configuration details for the list or 
library such as:
• 
 Location of the list or library 
• 
 Number of folders and items 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
209
• 
 Versioning configuration 
• 
 Content approval requirements 
• 
 Security and records management details 
• 
 Policy information 
 To create a file plan report for a list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you  want to create the report. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Generate File Plan Report option from the 
Permissions and Management section. 
 
 4. 
 On the File  Plan  Report page, identify where you want to save the report, and 
click the OK button. 
 The file plan report is generated and presented to you. 
 List and Library Office Integration 
 Microsoft Office Excel and Access can be used to view and manage information in lists and libraries. These 
tools can create advanced views of the information and make it available even when you are not connected 
to SharePoint. 
 Excel SharePoint Integration 
 There are several ways  Excel can enhance list and library capabilities and take further advantage of the 
details in lists and libraries. 
 Exporting Lists or Libraries to Excel 
 When list or library information is exported to Excel, the information in the list or library columns can be 
viewed in Excel. To export a list or library to Excel, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library whose information you want to export. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Export to Excel option from the List or 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 When prompted to open or save the file, select the Open option. 
 
 4. 
 If prompted with an Excel security notification, click the Enable button. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
210
 
 5. 
 If Excel is not open when the Export to Excel option is selected, Excel opens, and the 
information from the list appears. If Excel is already open when Export to Excel is 
selected, the Import Data screen appears. On this screen, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 In the Select How You Want To View This Data In Your Workbook section, 
select to open the list as a table, PivotTable Report, or PivotChart. 
 
 
 b. 
  In the Where Do You Want To Put This Data section, specify an existing 
worksheet, a new worksheet, or a new workbook. 
 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to run the export. 
 The list or library  information opens in Excel and can be managed within the sheet. The information is 
configured as an External Data Source within Excel (see Figure  5-25 ). 
 Figure 5-25.  List information in Excel 
 Identifying the details in Excel that are part of the external data source is easy since they are outlined 
in a border. Opening a list in Excel lets you use tools like PivotTables and PivotCharts to create needed 
representations of the data. While you can use Excel to format and manipulate list information, you cannot 
publish content changes back to the list. 
 Excel has several data integration options for use in working with external data. This information is 
available on a Design ribbon tab added to Excel when a cell is highlighted within the exported data set. The 
more commonly used options include the following:
• 
 Refresh : This option, which reloads the details from the list into Excel, provides an 
accurate representation of current information in the list. 
 
■ Note   Refreshing the information in Excel causes any edits made to it in Excel to be lost. 
• 
 Open In Browser : Opens the web browser and navigates you to the default view of the 
list. 
• 
 Unlink : This option, which disconnects Excel from the details in the list, makes the 
copy of the data in Excel independent of the list. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
211
 Importing a Spreadsheet into Excel as a List 
 An earlier section in this chapter explained how to create lists and libraries in SharePoint with the Add an 
App interface. This method works well for  creating  new empty lists. However, sometimes the information 
you want in a new SharePoint list already exists. In this case you can use Excel as a mechanism to create the 
list and add the existing information to it by using the Import Spreadsheet option to create a new custom list 
in your SharePoint site. To create a new custom list based on the information in an Excel spreadsheet, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to create the list.  
 
 2. 
 Navigate to the Site Contents page for the site.  
 
 3. 
 On the Site Contents page, click the Add an App option in the Lists, Libraries, and 
Other Apps section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Your Apps page, select the Import Spreadsheet option. 
 
 5. 
 In the new window, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 In the Name and Description section, enter a name for the new list and an 
optional description. 
 
 
 b. 
 In the Import from Spreadsheet section, select the file to import. 
 
 
 c. 
 Click the Import button to complete the import. 
 
 6. 
 In the opened Excel window, select the cell range to import, and click the Import 
button. 
 The list is created, and the data from the Excel document is imported. 
 To initiate the creation of the custom list and the data import from Excel through the Excel interface, do 
the following:
 
 1. 
 Open the Excel document with the information needed to create the list. 
 
 2. 
 Highlight the range of values to include. 
 
 3. 
 Select the Format as Table option from the Styles group of the Home ribbon tab, 
and select a style. 
 
 4. 
 In the Format as Table dialog, click the My table Has Headers check box if the 
values include column headers. 
 
 5. 
 Click the OK button. 
 Once the values are formatted as a table, the details can be used as the basis for a custom list. To publish 
the list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Select the Excel table. 
 
 2. 
 Select the Export command from the External Table Data group of the Table 
Tools Design ribbon tab, and select the Expert Table to SharePoint List option. 
 
 3. 
 In the Export Table to SharePoint Site dialog, enter the URL of the SharePoint site 
where the list is to be created. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
212
 
 4. 
 In the Export Table to SharePoint List Step 1 box, do the following:
 
 
 a. 
 In the Address section, enter the URL to the site where the list is to be 
created, and specify whether a read-only connection is to be established. 
 
 
 b. 
 In the Name field, specify the name of the new list. 
 
 
 c. 
 In the Description field, enter an optional description. 
 
 
 d. 
 Click the Next button. 
 
 5. 
 In the Export Table to SharePoint List Step 2 box, click the Finish button.  
 
 6. 
 In the  confirmation window, click the OK button. 
 The list is created in the site meant to contain the data from the source Excel document.   
 Access SharePoint Integration 
 Besides being able to manage list and library content in Excel, Microsoft Access can work with list 
information.  Access is used to work with list data since it allows you not only to manage the information but 
also to create reports based on the information (Access cannot be used, however, to manage library data). 
A key difference between Excel, as discussed earlier, and Access in managing list data is that while Excel 
cannot update information in the list, Access can push changes made in it back to the SharePoint list. 
 To work with a SharePoint list in Access, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list to be opened in Microsoft Access. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the Open with Access option from the 
List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Access window, enter a filename and location for the Access database file. 
Also, specify whether to link the database to the list or export information from 
the list. 
 The list is made available in Access. If you link to the list, any changes made in Access are pushed to 
SharePoint as well. If you export the list, then a copy of it is made in Access. Since the copy is not directly 
related to the list itself, changes made after export in Access or in the list are not reflected in the other 
environment. 
 Synchronizing List and Libraries for Offline Access 
 Since SharePoint sites can be synchronized with your local computer, you can access information even 
without a connection to the SharePoint environment. With Microsoft Office 2013 or Microsoft Office 2016, 
SharePoint libraries are synchronized locally using OneDrive for Business. 
 OneDrive for Business lets you synchronize document library content with your local computer and 
makes it accessible within your local file system:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site containing the content to be synchronized. 
 
 2. 
 In a site page containing a library view to synchronize, select Sync from the 
library view menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the security message, click the Allow button. 
 
 4. 
 In the Sync window, click the Sync Now button. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MANAGING LISTS AND LIBRARIES
213
 The content is synchronized with the local OneDrive for Business location. This content is kept current 
as long as the computer can connect to the SharePoint environment. Synchronization allows use of the 
content whether the machine can or cannot connect to the environment. 
 Summary 
 This chapter introduced lists and libraries, including how to create, manage and delete them. We introduced 
the different types of columns that can be added to lists and libraries and demonstrated how to add and 
configure these columns. We also looked at views discussing how to create and use them. We then focused 
on managing permissions showing how to manage permissions for the lists and libraries as well as for 
individual items contained within the lists and libraries. Finally we provided an overview of how lists and 
libraries integrate with  Microsoft Office products expanding on how the information in the lists and libraries 
can be leveraged. 
 In the next chapter we will further focus our discussions on lists. We will discuss the types of lists that 
can be created within SharePoint. We will also discuss how to create and manage these lists as well as work 
with items within them.

 CHAPTER 6  
 Working with Lists 
 Lists are used to store structured sets of information in SharePoint. Whether you need to track tasks, store 
contacts, or summarize products, you can use lists to store, manage, and share their information. In Chapter   5 , 
we discussed how to create and configure lists and libraries. In this chapter, we discuss the different types of 
lists available in SharePoint 2013 and how to create and manage content within them. 
 Types of Lists 
 As was discussed in Chapter   5 , when you create a new list, you base it on an available template. SharePoint 
2016 has several default list templates available to use for creating new SharePoint lists. These templates are 
considered apps and are found in the app management tools. Available default list templates include the 
following. 
 Announcements 
 Announcements lists are used to store and share messages, news and announcements. These lists provide a 
structure and layout that includes a Title and Body for the announcement and an expiration date that can be 
used to identify when the announcement should no longer be listed in views. The full Announcements list 
structure is defined in Table  6-1 .

 Standard Format 
 An Announcements list is often added to the home page of a site to relay key messages to site users. 
When Announcements lists views are added to pages, they can be viewed in normal list view layouts, as 
discussed in Chapter   5 , or using a summary view specific to the type of list. For Announcements lists, the 
summary view is shown in Figure  6-1 . 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
216
 When announcement lists are initially created, they contain a single view called the All Items view. 
This view is a standard SharePoint list view and displays all the items in the announcements list sorted in 
descending order by Modified date and displays the following fields:
• 
 Title (linked to item with edit menu) 
• 
 Modified 
 Announcement lists have the same management and access capabilities as other lists in SharePoint 
but with an additional advanced capability: announcement lists are among the few list types that support 
incoming e-mail. 
 Incoming E-Mail Capabilities 
 Announcement lists can be configured with an e-mail address allowing users to send e-mail messages 
directly to the list. When e-mail messages are sent to an e-mail address associated with an announcement 
list the following details from the Outlook message are mapped to the SharePoint announcement:
• 
 E-mail subject is saved to the announcement Title. 
• 
 E-mail body is saved to the announcement Body. 
• 
 E-mail From address is saved to the announcement Created By. 
• 
 E-mail attachments are saved as attachments in the announcement list item. 
 
■ Note   Before a SharePoint list’s incoming e-mail capabilities can be utilized, your SharePoint technical 
administrator will need to configure your environment to support inbound e-mail. 
 Figure 6-1.  Announcements list web part summary  view 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
217
 Once incoming e-mail capabilities have been configured in your SharePoint environment, your 
SharePoint announcements lists can be configured to support incoming e-mail. To configure the incoming 
e-mail settings for your announcements list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Announcements list where you want to configure incoming 
e-mail. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the List Settings option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Incoming E-mail Settings option from the 
Communications section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Incoming E-mail Settings page, make the following selections:
 a. 
 In the Incoming E-mail section, select Yes for the Allow This List to Receive 
E-mail option, and enter the e-mail address for the library. 
 b. 
 In the E-mail Attachments section, specify whether e-mail attachments are 
to be saved to the list. 
 c. 
 In the E-mail Message section, specify whether the original e-mail message 
is to be saved. 
 d. 
 In the E-mail Meeting Invitations section, specify whether meeting 
invitations sent to the list are to be created as announcements. 
 e. 
 In the E-mail Security section, specify whether e-mail messages are to be 
accepted only from e-mail addresses associated with users that have access 
to the library or from any e-mail address. 
 f. 
  Once all information has been entered, click the OK button to save the 
settings. 
 The inbound e-mail configuration is saved, and you are returned to the Settings page.    
 Contacts 
 Contacts lists are used to maintain details about people. These lists can be used to track contacts for 
projects, departments, initiatives, and any other efforts. Contacts lists include the fields necessary to track 
key demographics details about people and are listed in Table  6-2 .  

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
218
 The summary view that can be selected when a contacts list is added to a page is structured as shown in 
Figure  6-2  and includes the following fields:
• 
 Last Name 
• 
 First Name 
• 
 Business Phone 
•

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
219
 When a contacts list is created, it contains only a single list view, called All Contacts. This list view 
presents the following fields from the contacts list, with items sorted by Last Name and First Name:
• 
 Attachments 
• 
 Last Name (Linked to Item with Edit Menu)  
• 
 First Name 
• 
 Company 
• 
 Business Phone 
• 
 Home Phone 
• 
 Email Address 
 SharePoint contacts lists and Outlook contact lists are similarly structured to help support special 
integration between SharePoint and Outlook. This integration includes the ability to export SharePoint 
contacts so that they can be saved to Outlook and the ability to synchronize SharePoint contacts lists with 
Outlook. 
 Exporting  Contacts 
 Contacts in a SharePoint contacts lists can be exported to be saved as contacts in Outlook. Exporting a 
contact creates a copy of a contact in Outlook. To export a contact in a SharePoint contacts list, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the contacts list from which you want to export the contact.  
 
 2. 
 On the contacts list view page, select the Export Contact option from the 
contact’s context menu’s Advanced submenu, as shown in Figure  6-3 .

 3. 
 When prompted to open or save the  .vcf file, choose the Open option. 
 
 4. 
 If Outlook is installed, a New Contact window will open. Make any desired 
updates to the contact information and click the Save option to save the contact 
as an Outlook contact. 
 The contact is saved to Outlook. 
 
■ Note   Once a contact is exported from SharePoint and imported into Outlook, any changes to the contact in 
one program will not affect the contact in the other. There is no relationship maintained between these items. 
 Connecting Contacts Lists to  Outlook 
 While exporting contacts from SharePoint and importing them into Outlook creates a separate copy of 
the contact that can then be used in Outlook, making it easy to send e-mails to the contact and to make 
the contact’s details available for calling, it creates a situation where there are two separate copies of the 
contact’s details to be managed. An alternate option for making a contact available in Outlook is to 
synchronize the contact details between Outlook and SharePoint. Connecting the SharePoint contact list to 
Outlook synchronizes the information allowing you to continue managing and working with the contacts 
in SharePoint but keeping the information current in Outlook. You can also update the contact in Outlook, 
which will in turn update the contact in SharePoint. Synchronizing contacts lists enables you to use and 
manage this information in both environments. To connect a SharePoint contacts list to Outlook, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the contacts list you want to synchronize with Outlook.  
 
 2. 
 On the contacts list view page, select the Connect to Outlook option from the List 
ribbon tab.

 3. 
 In the Allow the Web Site to Open a Program window, select the Allow button. 
 
 4. 
 In the Connect this SharePoint Contact List to Outlook message, click the Yes 
button. 
 The contacts list is connected to Outlook and made available on the Outlook Contacts tab. The list of 
contacts is also cached locally so that you can access them from Outlook when you are not connected to 
your SharePoint environment. 
 Calendar 
 SharePoint calendars let you store details about any type of event, such as a meeting or conference. Unlike 
most other list types, a calendar list has a completely different set of default views, most being based on the 
calendar layout discussed in Chapter   5 (see Figure  6-4 ). 
 Figure 6-4.  Calendar  view 
 When calendar lists are created, they include a set of fields necessary to track the details about events. 
This type of list has content type management enabled within the list with one content type, Event, being 
available. The Event content type includes the fields listed in Table  6-3 .  
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
222
 Calendar lists have three default views providing different options for displaying and managing the 
events. These are the default views:
• 
 Calendar : The calendar view, the default view for the calendar list, shows the details 
in the list within a calendar layout. This layout defaults to a month view format, but 
it can be changed to week and day view formats. The following columns are listed in 
this view:
• 
 Time Interval Values
• 
 Begin : Start Time 
• 
 End : End Time 
• 
 Calendar Columns
• 
 Month View Title : Title 
• 
 Week View Title : Title 
• 
 Week View Sub Heading : Location 
• 
 Day View Title : Title 
•

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS

• 
 All  Events : The All Events view is a standard list view that lists all the events in the list 
sorted by the event start time. This view can be used to manage the list details just as 
the information in other lists is managed. This view shows recurring events as single 
items in the list and allows management of the recurring items instead of listing each 
occurrence separately (recurring events are discussed later in this chapter). The 
fields presented in the view include the following:
• 
 Recurrence 
• 
 Workspace 
• 
 Title (linked to item with Edit menu) 
• 
 Location 
• 
 Start Time 
• 
 End Time 
• 
 All Day Event 
• 
 Current  Events : Like the All Events view, the Current Events view is a standard list 
view. However, recurring events in the Current Events view have a listing for each 
occurrence of the event. The Current Events view includes the same columns as 
those included in the All Events view. 
 Like some other lists, calendar lists have a unique integration capabilities with Microsoft Outlook that 
allow calendar lists to be synchronized with Outlook. Calendar lists also allow for overlays which allows for a 
calendar list to show events in the calendar view that are managed in other calendar lists in SharePoint. 
 Recurrence 
 One of the unique capabilities of a calendar list is that events can be marked as recurring. A recurring event 
is an event occurring more than once over time on a defined schedule. For example, you could mark a 
weekly staff meeting as recurring so that it appears on the calendar each week. When creating a new list 
item or editing an existing item in a calendar, you can determine if it should be a recurring item. To create a 
recurring event, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the calendar list in which to create the recurring event. 
 
 2. 
 On the calendar view page, select the New Event option from the Events ribbon 
tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the New Item form, do the following:
 a. 
 Enter a title for the event. 
   b. 
   Optionally, enter a location for the event.  
 c. 
 Enter a start time and end time for the event. 
 d. 
 Enter an optional description for the event. 
 e. 
 Optionally, select an event category. 
 f. 
 Specify whether the event is to be listed as an all-day event. 
 g. 
 Identify that the event is a repeating event to show the repeating event 
options. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
224
 h. 
  In the Recurrence area, identify the recurrence approach as daily, weekly, 
monthly, or yearly, and then update the recurrence details. These details 
vary based on the pattern selected and are defined in Table  6-4 .  
 i. 
 In the Date Range section, identify the start date for the event and define 
the end date as no end date (the event recurs endlessly), end after a defined 
number of occurrences, or stop repeating at a specific date. 
 j. 
 Once all the information is entered, click the Save button. 
 The recurring event is saved to the calendar. 
 Figure 6-5.  All Events view with recurring items 
 Table 6-4.  Recurring Time Periods and Patterns 
 Time Period

 Daily 
 Every X days or every weekday 
 Weekly 
 Recur every X weeks on the specified days 
 Monthly 
 Day X of each Y months or the X day of the week of every Y months 
 Yearly 
 On a specific day or on day X of a specified month 
 When a recurring event is displayed in the All Events view, it contains an icon identifying it as a 
recurring item, as shown in Figure  6-5 . 
 In the All Events view, the recurring events are listed only once, representing the event series. However, 
the Current Events view shows each instance of recurring events. 
 When you create new views in a calendar list, you can select an additional type of view, called the 
Standard View with Expanded Recurring Events. Views created from this type display each instance of 
recurring events, much like the Current Events view. A standard view represents recurring events as a single 
item within the list, as the All Events view does. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
225
 Calendar Overlays 
 Another unique capability available in SharePoint calendars is the calendar overlay feature. A calendar 
overlay lets you layer the contents of multiple calendars onto a single calendar view. Use it when you are 
managing more than one calendar in your SharePoint environment but want to create a consolidated view 
of all events across these calendars. For example, you might use it if you have department sites. In these sites 
each department maintains its own calendar, but you might also want a company calendar to consolidate 
the view of all the department calendar details. To configure a calendar overlay, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the calendar list on top of which you want to overlay other calendar 
events. Ensure you are viewing a calendar view of the list.  
 
 2. 
 On the calendar view page, select the Calendars Overlay option from the 
Calendar ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the first Calendar Overlay Settings page, click the New Calendar link. 
 
 4. 
 On the second Calendar Overlay Settings page, enter the details about the 
calendar to overlay, including the following:
 a. 
 In the Name and Type section, enter a name for the calendar and the type of 
calendar. If the calendar is in SharePoint, select SharePoint as the calendar 
type. If you want to include an Exchange calendar, select Exchange. 
 b. 
  In the Calendar Overlay Settings section, do the following:
 i. 
 Add an optional description for the calendar, to appear when the cursor 
hovers over the calendar’s name in the calendar view section of the 
Quick Launch. 
 ii. 
 Identify the color to be used for items from the selected calendar. 
 iii.  If SharePoint is the selected calendar type, enter the URL to the site 
where the calendar is located and click the Resolve button. This 
updates the list drop-down to include calendar lists in the selected site. 
Select the appropriate calendar list and then list view used to determine 
the items to include in the overlay. 
 iv. 
 If Exchange is the selected calendar type, enter the Outlook Web Access 
URL to the calendar or the URL to the Exchange web services. 
 v. 
 Specify whether the overlay is always to be included on the calendar. If 
it’s not selected, users viewing the list can remove the overlay.  
 vi.  Once the information is entered, click the OK button. 
 Follow the previous steps to include up to ten calendar overlays within a select calendar. Each calendar 
included is listed in the calendar view shown in Figure  6-6 . 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
226
 Group Calendars 
 Group calendars  are configurable within calendar lists to let you identify whether a calendar is to be used 
to share members’ schedules. This configuration creates a calendar based on a different content type and 
includes calendar views different from those in a standard calendar. These views allow you to add people to 
the view in order to show events by person. These additional views, called the Day Group and Week Group 
views, are shown in Figures  6-7 and  6-8 . Calendar lists are configured to take advantage of group calendar 
options, as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the calendar list where you want to enable the group calendar 
options. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the List Settings option from the Calendar ribbon 
tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the List Name, Description, and Navigation option 
from the General Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the General Settings page in the Group Calendar Options section, set the 
Use This Calendar to Share Member’s Schedule? option to Yes and click the Save 
button.

 Exporting  Events 
 Calendar lists allow users to export items from a list and import them into Outlook as Outlook calendar 
events. Any list event can be imported into Outlook, with recurring events exportable one instance at a time. 
To export an event, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the calendar list view for the calendar containing items to be 
exported. 
 
 2. 
 On the calendar view page, select the event you want to export. 
 
 3. 
 On the item view page, select the Export Event option from the Custom 
Commands ribbon tab. 
 
 4. 
 When prompted to open or save the file, select the Open button.  
 
 5. 
 A new Outlook appointment window is opened for the selected item. 
 
 6. 
 In the appointment window, make any needed updates to the item and save the 
item. 
 The item is saved and added to your Outlook calendar. Once the export to Outlook is complete, the 
relationship between the items is severed. Changing one does not affect the other. 
 Connecting Calendar Lists to  Outlook 
 Another advanced feature of calendar lists is the ability to connect them to Outlook. When a SharePoint 
calendar list is connected to Outlook, it appears as an Outlook calendar and allows the calendar to be used 
in both SharePoint and Outlook, with changes made in one environment reflected in the other. To connect a 
calendar list in SharePoint to Outlook, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the calendar list you want to connect to Outlook.  
 
 2. 
 On the calendar view page, select the Connect to Outlook option from the 
Calendar ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Allow Access window, click the Allow button.  
 
 4. 
 In the Connect the SharePoint Calendar to Outlook window, click the Yes button. 
 The SharePoint calendar is listed in Outlook on the Calendar screen. Edits to the calendar in either 
environment update the list. Outlook caches a local copy of a calendar, so it is available even when your 
computer cannot connect to the SharePoint environment. 
 Incoming E-Mail Capabilities 
 Calendar lists, like Announcement lists, can accept incoming e-mail messages. When a meeting request is 
sent to a calendar, the details in the request are used to create a new event in the SharePoint calendar. 
 
■ Reminder  Before a SharePoint list’s incoming e-mail settings can be utilized, a SharePoint technical 
administrator must configure your SharePoint environment to support incoming e-mail. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
229
 In a SharePoint environment where incoming e-mail has been configured, you can update your list to 
support incoming e-mail by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to configure inbound e-mail.  
 
 2. 
 On the calendar view page, select the List Settings option from the Calendar 
ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Incoming E-mail Settings link from the 
Communications section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Incoming E-mail Settings page, enter the following:
 a. 
 In the Incoming E-mail section, select Yes for the Allow This List to Receive 
E-Mail option and enter the e-mail address to use for the list. 
 b. 
 In the E-mail Attachments section, specify whether attachments of sent 
e-mails are to be saved to the list item as attachments.  
 c. 
 In the E-mail Security section, select the e-mail security policy identifying 
whether the list should accept e-mails just from e-mail addresses of known 
users of the list or from any e-mail address.  
 d. 
 Once the information has been updated, click the OK button to save the 
settings. 
 The list is updated to accept e-mail messages, and you are returned to the list’s settings page. 
 Discussion Boards 
 A Discussion Board, used to manage discussion posts and replies, allows you to host discussion threads 
within your SharePoint sites. Discussion Board lists contain two separate content types. The first type is used 
to create the initial discussions, and the second is used to manage replies to the discussion. The column 
structure that supports the creation of the initial discussions includes the columns in Table  6-5 .

 Discussion lists, by default, are presented to users in a threaded format. They include three initial views, 
which can be used to view and manage the discussions and the replies. These views include the following:
• 
 Subject : The Subject view, the default view for the overall discussion itself, shows 
discussions available within the list. Sort is based on when the discussion was 
created and lists the following details (see Figure  6-9 ):

 Managing  Discussions 
 Management of Discussion Board content is different from that of other lists. Instead of list items for 
management being created, content is meant to develop organically as the discussion matures. To create a 
new discussion in a discussion list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Discussion Board, where you want to create the new discussion.  
 
 2. 
 On the Discussion list view page, select the New Discussion option. 
 
 3. 
 On the New Discussion form, enter the subject and body for the discussion, and 
identify whether it is a question. Then click the Save button to save the new item. 
 Once a discussion is available in a discussion list, people with appropriate rights can reply to content. 
Reply to a discussion or to an already posted reply by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 On the Discussion list view page, click the title of the discussion.  
 
 2. 
 On the discussion thread view page, click the Reply option for the item that you 
want to create the reply for. 
 
 3. 
 In the Reply box, type the reply text into the box, and click the Reply button to 
save the reply. 
 The discussion view is updated to include the new reply.  
 Marking a Discussion As  Featured 
 Featured discussions appear in the Featured Discussion view of the list. Discussions are flagged as featured 
to raise their importance in the list.
 
 1. 
 On the Discussion list view page, select the Management view from the view 
drop-down on the List ribbon tab. 
 
 2. 
 On the Management view for the list, check the box in front of the item to mark 
it as featured, and then select the Mark as Featured option from the Moderation 
ribbon tab. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
233
 Incoming E-Mail Capabilities 
 The  Discussion Board is another list that can accept incoming e-mail messages. When discussion lists are 
configured to support incoming e-mail, messages sent to the list are added as discussions and replies to 
discussions. This allows contributions to discussions through e-mail. When an e-mail is sent to a discussion 
list, the following information is used to create the new discussion or reply:
• 
 The subject of the e-mail becomes the Subject field value in the list. 
• 
 The body of the e-mail becomes the Body field value in the list. 
• 
 The From address of the e-mail becomes the Created By value.  
• 
 Attachments to the e-mail become attachments to the list item. 
 
■ Note   In order to enable incoming e-mail against a list, a SharePoint technical administrator must have 
configured inbound e-mail for the SharePoint environment. 
 Issue  Tracking 
 An issue tracking list is designed to store and manage related issues against which action needs to be taken. 
These might include project, system, application, or process issues. A list created from the Issues Tracking

 The default set of views available against an issue tracking list when it is initially created include 
the following:
• 
 All Issues : The All Issues view, the default view for the list, provides a standard view 
of all items stored in the list. This view is sorted by ID and includes the following 
columns:
• 
 Issue ID (linked to item) 
• 
 Title (linked to item with Edit menu) 
•

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
235
• 
 My Issues : This view, which displays all the issues assigned to the current user and 
is sorted by ID, lets the person viewing the list see just those items he or she is 
responsible for. The view contains the following columns:
• 
 Issue ID (linked to item) 
• 
 Title (linked to item with Edit menu) 
• 
 Issue Status 
• 
 Priority 
• 
 Due Date 
• 
 Active Issues : The Active Issues view shows the items in the list with an Issue Status of 
Active. This view lists all issues still requiring attention. The issues are sorted by ID, 
and the view includes the following fields:
• 
 Issue ID (linked to item) 
• 
 Title (linked to item with Edit menu) 
• 
 Assigned To 
• 
 Priority 
•

 E-Mail Notifications 
 Items in an issues list can be configured so that e-mail notifications are sent to users assigned to the issue. 
Thus, assigned users can be made aware of the assignment and be informed of changes made to the issue. 
To enable e-mail notifications for an issues list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Issue Tracking list where you want to enable e-mail notifications.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the List Settings option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the E-mail Notification section, select Yes for 
the Send E-Mail When Ownership Is Assigned? option, and click the OK button. 
 Links 
 The links list template is used to create lists that contain web links. These can be links to internal or external 
web resources or web references to pictures. Use links lists when you need to manage and share references 
to web sites and other web-referenceable resources or when you want to present images referenced through 
web URLs. Links lists include the columns shown in Table  6-8 .  

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
236
 The links list contains a single view, the All Links view, that includes all the items in the list and displays 
the following columns:
• 
 Type (icon linked to document) 
• 
 Edit (link to Edit item) 
• 
 URL (URL with edit menu) 
• 
 Notes 
 When the list is added to a page within a site, it has a special summary view that creates a bulleted list of 
the items contained within the list, as shown in Figure  6-12 .

 Changing List Item Order 
 Link lists permit items to be manually sorted allowing the order to be determined by the manager of the 
links. To manually set the order of the items in a link list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the links list in which you want to reorder the items. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the Change Item Order option from the Items ribbon 
tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Change Item Order window, change the order of the listed items by 
changing the Position from Top numbers. Once the items are in the correct order, 
click the OK button. 
 The link order is updated based on the selections made. 
 
■ Note   Since clicking a link in a links list navigates the current browser window to the referenced URL, 
doing so to a URL not in your SharePoint environment causes you to leave the SharePoint environment. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
237
 Promoted Links 
 The promoted links list is used to create a set of links that are presented as a set of tiles. It functions much as 
the Get Started with Your Site web part, seen on the Team Site home page. The Promoted Links list is used 
when you want to manage a list of intranet or Internet links but want to present them in a more stylized 
fashion and with more navigation control than the normal links list allows. 
 The promoted links list contains a structure designed to help manage the presentation of the stored 
links, as shown in Table  6-9 .

 When you create a new promoted link item, specify the details for the link to be created, including 
the URL to connect to, as well as the details for the imaging used to represent the link, among which are 
identifying the title and description of the item and the background image to use for the link. Also specify the 
order in which the link is to be listed and the launch behavior desired when the link is clicked. 
 The promoted links list initially includes two views.
• 
 Tiles : The default view for the list, Tiles view presents the list of items in a tiled 
fashion (see Figure  6-13 ) and includes the following details:
• 
 Background Image Location : Displaying the referenced image as the 
background for the tile. 
• 
 Title : overlaid on the tile image. 
• 
 Description : Added to the overlay on the image when the mouse hovers over the 
image. 
• 
 Link Location : Identifying the URL to navigate to when the tile is clicked.  
• 
 Launch Behavior : Identifying the approach for navigating to the URL. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
238
• 
 All Promoted Links : This view, which displays all items in the list in a standard list 
view is ordered based on the Order column value and is used to manage the items in 
the list. The view includes the following columns:
• 
 Title 
• 
 Background Image Location 
• 
 Description 
• 
 Link Location 
• 
 Launch Behavior 
• 
 Order 
 When a promoted links list web part is added to a page within the site, it includes the use of the Tiles 
view, shown in Figure  6-13 . 
 Survey 
 Surveys are a specially formatted list that lets you configure and manage survey questions and track survey 
responses. While survey lists store and manage data as other lists do, they include a highly customized interface 
for management of the list itself, as well as for responding to surveys and viewing results. Instead of viewing the 
list column structure when accessing the list settings, the survey Settings page is used to create and manage 
questions for inclusion in the survey. Once a survey has been created, instead of adding columns like you would 
for the other types of lists, you add the questions that will make up the survey. This is done as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the created survey where you need to add questions. 
 
 2. 
 On the survey view page, select the Add Questions option from the Settings 
menu. 
 
 3. 
 In the New Question window, do the following:
 a. 
 In the Question and Type section, enter the question text and choose the 
question type. 
 b. 
  In the Additional Question Settings section, do the following:
 i. 
 If the question type is Single Line of Text, then specify whether the field is 
required, whether unique values are to be enforced, what the maximum 
number of characters is, and whether there is to be a default value.  
 ii. 
 If the question type is Multiple Lines of Text, then specify whether the 
field is required, how many lines to display for editing, and whether the 
field is to include plain or rich text. 
 Figure 6-13.  Tiles view 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
239
 iii.  If the question type is Choice, then specify whether the item is required, 
whether unique values are to be enforced, the question choices and the 
display format for the choices, and whether there is to be a default value.  
 iv. 
 If the question type is Rating Scale, then specify whether the item is 
required, the list of sub-questions to rate, the number range for the 
rating, and the range text, and whether an N/A (“not applicable”) 
option is to be included. 
 v. 
 If the question type is Number, specify whether the item is required, 
what unique values are to be enforced, whether there are minimum or 
maximum values, how many decimal places to show, and whether the 
item is to be shown as a percentage. 
 vi.  If the question type is Currency, specify whether the item is required, 
what unique values are to be enforced, whether there are minimum 
or maximum values, how many decimal places to show, and whether 
there is to be a default value. 
 vii.  If the question type is Date and Time, specify whether the item is 
required, whether unique values are to be enforced, what the date 
format is, and whether there is to be a default value.  
 viii.  If the question type is Lookup, specify whether the item is required, 
what unique values are to be enforced, what list and field to obtain 
values from, and which values to include in the display.  
 ix.  If the question type is Yes/No, identify the default value.  
 x. 
 If the question type is Person or Group, specify whether the item is 
required, whether unique values are to be enforced, whether multiple 
values are to be allowed, whether only people or both people and 
groups are to be selectable, whether selections can be made from all 
users or just from a selected SharePoint group, and which field to show. 
 xi. 
 If the question type is Page Separator, there are no other options. This 
simply identifies whether a page separator is to be placed in the current 
location to divide up the survey questions. 
 xii.  If the question type is External Data, specify whether the item is 
required, what external content type and field to use, and whether the 
actions menu is to be displayed and whether the column is to be linked 
to the default action of the content type. 
 xiii.  If the question type is Managed Metadata, specify whether the item is 
required, whether unique values are to be enforced, and what term set 
to use. 
 c. 
 If you have more questions to enter, click the Next Question button. If you 
have no more questions to enter, then click the Finish button. 
 The questions added are made part of the survey. Once they are added to the survey, you can add 
branching logic, which enables the survey to jump to different questions based on answers to prior 
questions. To set branching logic within the survey, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the created survey where you need to add branching logic. 
 
 2. 
 On the survey view page, select the Survey Settings option from the Settings menu.  

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
240
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the question whose answers are to result in question 
branching. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit Question page in the Branching Logic section, identify the value, and 
jump to question combinations. Once done, click the OK button. 
 Question branching is established, and you are returned to the list’s Settings page. 
 Responding to a  Survey 
 Responding to a survey works the same way as adding items to a list. To respond to a survey, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the survey view page. 
 
 2. 
 On the survey view page, click the Respond to This Survey link.  
 
 3. 
 On the Survey Response page, enter the responses to the questions. Once 
completed, click the Finish button. 
 If you want to stop taking a survey partway through, click the Cancel button to leave the survey response 
page. If you have completed answers to previous survey pages when you click the Cancel button, you are 
prompted either to save the answers to the questions already answered or to remove previously entered 
information. You can also click the Close button on a page to save the questions entered and close the survey 
response at the current point. 
 When you complete a survey response, you are taken to the survey list page (see Figure  6-14 ), which 
lists the summary of entered responses and enables you to display a graphical summary of the responses. 
Clicking the graphic summary option updates the view of the results to a graphical representation, as shown 
in Figure  6-15 .

 Tasks 
 The tasks list is one of the most commonly used lists in SharePoint. Use it to assign and manage activities to be 
performed and to track progress against them. The tasks list has the column structure defined in Table  6-10 .  
 Figure 6-15.  Survey results graphical summary 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
242
 A tasks list, when created, has an initial set of views designed to assist in managing the included tasks. 
This initial set of views includes the  following  :
• 
 All Tasks : The default view for the tasks list. It shows all tasks in the list in a standard 
SharePoint list view and includes the following details:
• 
 Completed 
• 
 Task Name (linked to item with Edit menu) 
• 
 Due Date 
•

243
• 
 Late Tasks : The Late Tasks view lists tasks that have not been completed and whose 
due date has passed and orders them by Due Date and Priority so that the tasks are 
organized to show which are the least and the farthest overdue. This view and the All 
Tasks view list the same fields. 
• 
 Upcoming : The Upcoming view lists all tasks that have not been completed and 
where the Due Date is in the future. It includes the same columns as the All Tasks 
and Late Tasks views. 
• 
 Completed : The Completed view lists all tasks identified as 100% complete showing 
just those tasks that do not require additional work. This view also shows the same 
columns as the All Tasks view. 
• 
 My Tasks : The My Tasks view lists all tasks assigned to the current logged-on user. It 
shows the same columns as the previous task views.  
• 
 Gantt Chart : The Gantt Chart view takes the information in the tasks list and 
organizes it into a Gantt chart, where the overall timeline for the listed activities is 
displayed. This view lists the following columns:
• 
 Task Name (linked to item with Edit menu) 
• 
 Start Date 
• 
 Due Date 
• 
 % Complete 
• 
 Predecessors 
• 
 Assigned To 
• 
 GUID 
• 
 Calendar : The calendar view displays the tasks within a calendar and represents the 
tasks as activities within that calendar. 
 Along with these default views, tasks lists can also be viewed with the timeline web part, which displays 
the activities within a timeline chart that lists the tasks by duration and contains percent complete details. In 
this view you can select a task to navigate to that task’s details (Figure  6-16  shows the timeline view). Adding 
and configuring web parts is discussed in Chapter   4 . 
 Figure 6-16.  Tasks timeline view 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
244
 Adding Subtasks 
 Task lists have much in common with Microsoft Project. This includes not only creating tasks in a task list 
but also creating subtasks. When working with a task list tasks are created in the same way that standard list 
items are created in other lists, detailed later in this chapter. However, with task lists you can choose to create 
subtasks under any task created. Subtasks are created by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the tasks list where you want to create the subtask. 
 
 2. 
 Select the ellipse menu for the task under which to create subtasks.  
 
 3. 
 From the item’s menu, select the Create Subtask option, as shown in Figure  6-17 . 
 Figure 6-17.  Task item menu 
 
 4. 
 Create the new subtask. 
 The subtask is created under the selected task and the parent task name is bolded. 
 Connecting Tasks Lists with  Outlook 
 As with contact and calendar lists, tasks lists can be connected to Outlook to allow access to the SharePoint 
tasks from within Outlook. When a tasks list is connected to Outlook, the tasks are available in the Outlook 
Tasks section allowing you to view and manage these SharePoint tasks from within Outlook. To connect a 
tasks list to Outlook, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the tasks list you want to connect to Outlook. 
 
 2. 
 On the tasks list page, select the Sync to Outlook option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Allow Access window, click the Allow Button.  
 
 4. 
 On the Connect this SharePoint Task List to Outlook window, select Yes. 
 The task list is added to the Tasks area in Outlook. As Outlook caches a local copy of the tasks list, you 
can access the information even when you do not have direct access to the SharePoint environment itself. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
245
 Open a Tasks List in  Project 
 SharePoint tasks lists can be opened in Microsoft Project. This lets you view and manage tasks within the 
Project environment and presents the tasks list as a standard project plan. To open a tasks list in Microsoft 
Project, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the tasks list to be opened in Microsoft Project. 
 
 2. 
 On the tasks list view page, select the Open with Project option from the List 
ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Open File Confirmation window, click the Yes button. 
 The tasks list opens in Microsoft Project. 
 External List 
 An external list is used to create a list based on a  Business Connectivity Services (BCS ) connection to 
information in an external data source, such as a Microsoft SQL Server database. This list, once created, 
shows the information in the external database as if it were a standard list in SharePoint. The BCS 
connection can be configured as a read-only connection to the source information or as a read/write 
connection. In a read-only connection, items in the external list cannot be edited, and the list is read-only 
for all users. A read/write connection allows you to edit list details, just as you would edit them in any other 
SharePoint list. 
 To create an external list you first must have an external content type available to create the external list 
against. Once you have an external content type the external list is created by selecting to create an external 
list from the list of available apps. 
 The format and structure of an external list is dependent on the data source structure the external 
content type is connected to. 
 Custom List 
 Custom lists are created when a list is needed that does not align with the structure of any of the other 
SharePoint list templates. A custom list is created with only a single column, called Title, which is a Single 
Line of Text column. Using a custom list, you can build a new list with a completely customized set of fields 
without having to remove other list columns or views. Lists created from the custom list template is initially 
configured with a single All Items view, which lists the Title field in a standard view. 
 Custom List in Datasheet View 
 Like the custom list, the custom list in datasheet view is used when the other list templates do not meet the 
needs of your list. It has the same columns and structure as the custom list. The only difference between 
these two templates is that lists created fro the Custom List in Datasheet View presents the list data in a 
datasheet layout instead of in a standard view layout.   
 Working with List Items 
 SharePoint lists are used to store and manage structured data. You can work with lists to track and manage 
a variety of types of information. In this section we will be discussing how to add, edit and manage items 
in lists. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
246
 Adding Items to a List 
 To add new items to a SharePoint list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to add the information. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, click the New Item link above the data being presented. 
For some lists this new item link may be named differently, such as new 
announcement, new task, etc. 
 
 3. 
 On the list item Add page, enter the details for the new item, making sure to 
populate all required fields. Once the information has been entered, click the 
Save button to create the new list item. 
 The item is added to the list, and you are returned to the list view page. 
 Editing Items in a  List 
 There are a couple of different options available for editing items in a SharePoint list. To edit individual items 
in a list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to edit the information.  
 
 2. 
 On the List View page for the item you want to edit, select the item’s ellipse 
menu, and then from the displayed Hover menu, select the Edit Item option 
(see Figure  6-18 ). 
 Figure 6-18.    List Item menu       
 
 3. 
 On the Edit Item page, make the changes to the details for the item, and then 
click the Save button to save the changes. 
 The information is saved to the list, and you are returned to the list view. An alternative approach for 
editing items in a list involves doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to edit the information.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, click the selection option next to the item to edit, and then 
select the Edit Item option from the Items ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Edit Item window, make updates to the listed information, and then click 
the Save button to save the changes. 
 The updates to the list are saved, and you are returned to the list view page. If you want to make 
multiple edits to a list all at once, you can use the Quick Edit option.  
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
247
 Figure 6-19.  Quick Edit view 
 Using  Quick Edit 
 The Quick Edit mode uses the datasheet view to allow you to edit multiple items in a list. Quick Edit presents a 
list view in an Excel-like format allowing you to edit the items directly from this display. You would use the Quick 
Edit view when you want to add or edit multiple items at once. Figure  6-19 shows the Quick Edit view of a list.  
 To open a list in the Quick Edit view, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list that you want to edit. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the Quick Edit option from the List ribbon tab.     
 The list is presented in the Quick Edit view. Once all adds and edits have been made, you can return 
to the list’s standard view by selecting the View option from the List ribbon tab or the Stop Editing This List 
option from the top of the list view.  
 Deleting Items in a  List 
 To delete items from a SharePoint list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to delete items.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, click the item’s context menu, and select the Delete Item 
option.  
 
 3. 
 In the delete confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The item is deleted, and the list of items is updated appropriately. If you want to delete multiple items 
from a list all at once, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to delete the items. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, check the box in front of to the items to be deleted and then 
from the Items ribbon tab, select the Delete Item option. 
 
 3. 
 In the delete confirmation window, click the OK button. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
248
 Working with Attachments 
 A list can be configured to attach files to the items saved in the list. By default, a new list added to SharePoint 
is configured to allow attachments to be added to list items. This feature can be enabled against any type of 
list in SharePoint. 
 Enable or Disable List  Attachments 
 If you do not want to let users attach files to items in a list item, you can disable this option. To change a list’s 
attachment options, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to update the list’s attachment settings. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the List Settings option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the List Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page, update the attachment settings as follows:
 a. 
  In the Attachments section, select either Disabled or Enabled to disable or 
enable the attachment settings. 
 b. 
 Click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The attachment settings are updated. 
 Adding Attachments to a  List Item 
 When attachments are enabled within a list, you can easily add attachments to the items in the list by doing 
the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to add attachments. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, check the selection option next to the item to be edited, 
and then select the Edit Item option from the Items ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Edit Item page, select the Attach File option from the Edit ribbon tab.  
 
 4. 
 In the Attach File window, select the file to attach, and click the OK button.  
 
 5. 
 On the Edit Item page, click the Save button. 
 The file will be attached to the item. You can also attach a file to an item by checking the box next to 
the item and selecting the Attach File option from the Items ribbon tab. Then select the file to upload. Once 
attachments are added to a list item, an icon identifying that an attachment is included appears in front of 
the item’s name in the list item view. Clicking on the icon opens the attachment.  
 Removing Attachments from a  List Item 
 Attachments added to a list item can be removed by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to remove attachments.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, check the selection option next to the item to be edited, 
and then select the Edit Item option from the Items ribbon tab. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
249
 
 3. 
 On the Edit Item page, click the delete option next to the attachment to be 
deleted. 
 
 4. 
 In the delete confirmation window, click the OK button.  
 
 5. 
 On the Edit Item page, click the Save button. 
 The attachment is deleted from the item. 
 Filtering and Sorting List Items 
 As lists can contain hundreds or even thousands of items, it is important to have a way to organize and 
locate information specific to your needs. Filtering a list allows you to limit the items presented to those that 
contain identified column values. Sorting allows you to identify the order of the items presented based on 
the values of an identified list column. 
 You can filter a list based on the values in the columns in the presented view. To filter items in a 
SharePoint list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list view page for the list to be filtered. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, hover over the title for the displayed column header to be 
used as a filter, and select the value(s) to filter by from the view title field’s 
drop-down menu. 
 When the list view is refreshed, the items presented are limited to those containing the selected filter 
value, and the column header is updated to include a filter icon to identify that the list is being filtered by the 
column. You can filter a list by more than one column if you need to. 
 To clear a filter applied against a list column on the list view page, click the title of the column with the 
filter, and click the Clear Filters option from the drop-down menu. The filter is removed, and the list view is 
updated to reflect the removal of the filter. 
 Besides filtering items within a list, you can also sort list items based on the content in a displayed 
column. The sort can be in either ascending or descending order by the listed columns. To sort the items 
within a list by a listed column, click on the column header that you want to sort the list by. Clicking the 
header once will sort the information in ascending order. Clicking it a second time will sort the column in 
descending order. 
 Metadata Navigation  
 A second method by which to filter the information in a list or library is to use the list’s or library’s metadata 
navigation settings to define columns to include as filter options in list views. Metadata navigation lets a list’s 
users easily filter its details to locate needed information. 
 To leverage metadata navigation within a list, the  capabilities   must first be enabled within the site where 
the list is located. This is done as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to use metadata navigation. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Manage Site Features option from the Site 
Actions section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Features page, click the Activate option next to the Metadata 
Navigation and Filtering feature.     

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
250
 Metadata navigation and filtering is activated, and the metadata navigation and filtering options are made 
available within the site’s lists. With this feature active, you can configure metadata navigation options against a 
list or library. To  configure metadata navigation options against a specific list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to configure metadata navigation.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Metadata Navigation Settings option from the 
General Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Metadata Navigation Settings page, do the following:
 a. 
  In the Configure Navigation Hierarchies section, select the fields that you 
want to appear as a hierarchy in the Metadata Navigation section for filtering 
the items. Hierarchy items are presented as a tree in the Quick Launch area, 
where the available values that can be filtered by are listed (see Figure  6-20 ). 
 Figure 6-20.    Metadata navigation: Navigation hierarchies       
 b. 
  In the Configure Key Filters section, identify the fields to allow filtering 
against. These fields will be listed below the navigation hierarchies in the 
Quick Launch area. The values or ranges of values that can be entered will 
depend on the field type (see Figure  6-21 ). 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
251
 Figure 6-21.  Metadata navigation: key filters 
 c. 
 In the Configure Automatic Column Indexing for this List section, specify 
whether list or library indexes are to be automatically configured based on 
the options selected for filtering or are not to be modified by the Metadata 
Navigation Settings options. 
 d. 
 Click the OK button to save the settings. 
 The metadata navigation  options are saved and added to the list view. With these options saved, the 
navigation hierarchy selected is listed below the Quick Launch options, and the Key Filters are listed below 
the metadata navigation options, as Figure  6-22 shows. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
252
 The Navigation Hierarchy section lists the fields identified for use. As you select values in the Navigation 
Hierarchy and Key Filters, the displayed view is appropriately updated. Any applied filters can be cleared by 
clicking the Clear button, which will update the list view and return it to its default state.  
 Using  Views 
 List views are used to create presentations of list data to meet the various needs of the users of the list (how 
to create and manage views is discussed in Chapter   5 ). To change the list view currently displayed, navigate 
to the list you want to view, and on the list view page, do one of the following:
• 
 Select the desired view from the Current View drop-down menu on the List 
ribbon tab.  
• 
 Click on the desired view name at the top of the list view. 
 Figure 6-22.  List view with metadata navigation options 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
253
 Working with  Folders  
 Folders can be created in any list or library where the folder feature is. In libraries, folders are enabled by 
default, while in lists they are initially disabled. Folders can be used to group and organize content into a 
set structure. They can be nested into any desired hierarchy to meet needs within the list and are best used 
when security differences must be maintained across the content in the list or library. 
 To allow or disallow folders in a list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to change the folder settings. 
 
 2. 
 On the view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the List or 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the Folders section, do the following:
 a. 
  If you want to enable folders, set the Make New Folder Command Available 
to Yes. 
 b. 
  If you want to disable the use of folders, set the Make New Folder Command 
Available to No. 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The ability to use folders against the list is updated when folders are enabled, you can create them 
within the list or library. To create new folders, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to create the folders.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the New Folder option from the Items or Files ribbon 
tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Create a New Folder window, enter the name of the folder to be created, 
and click the Save button. 
 The folder is created, and you are returned to the list view. 
 
■ Note   When items are placed in a folder, the structure of the content becomes rigid. Thus, using folders to 
organize content for display purposes is less desirable than using the grouping capabilities against columns in 
views to create these structures. Using two fields to group items allows creation of a two-level grouped display. 
This approach gives you the flexibility to create multiple views that organize information in different ways. 
 Managing Item Level Security 
 As is discussed in previous chapters, you can manage security against sites and lists. However, you are also 
able to manage security directly against items stored in lists and libraries. This includes list items, documents, 
and folders. When items are initially created in a list or library, they inherit the permissions of that list or 
library. This inheritance, however, can be broken, and permissions can be applied directly to the items. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
254
 Managing Permission  Inheritance 
 Before you can change the permissions on a list item, you must configure the item so that it no longer 
inherits permissions from the list that contains it. To break inheritance on an item in a list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list view showing the item whose permissions you want to 
manage. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, click the item to be managed, and then select the Share 
With option on the Items ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Shared With window, select the Advanced option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Permissions page, update the permission inheritance settings for the item 
by doing the following:
 a. 
  To stop inheriting permissions, select the Stop Inheriting Permissions 
option from the Permissions ribbon tab. In the confirmation window, click 
the OK button. 
 b. 
 To reestablish inheritance between the list and the item, select the Delete 
Unique Permissions option from the Permissions ribbon tab. In the 
confirmation window, click the OK button.         
 The permission inheritance is updated to reflect the selections made. 
 Editing Item Permissions 
 Once a folder or list item’s permissions inheritance settings have been broken, you can update the item’s 
permissions. Do so as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list view showing the item whose permission inheritance has 
been removed and whose permissions you want to update.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, check the selection box next to the item, and then select 
the Shared With option on the Items ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Shared With window, select the Advanced option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Permissions page, do the following:
 a. 
 To add user permissions:
 i. 
 Select the Grant Permissions option from the Permissions ribbon tab.  
 ii. 
 On the Share screen, enter the accounts to which permissions are to be 
added. If providing permissions other than Edit, click the Show Options 
link, and then select the desired permission level. Once the appropriate 
permissions are selected, click the Share button.      
 b. 
 To edit user permissions:
 i. 
 Check the box next to the item to be edited and click the Edit User 
Permissions button from the Permissions ribbon tab. 
 ii. 
 On the Edit Permissions page, select the appropriate permissions and 
click the OK button. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
255
 c. 
 To delete user permissions:
 i. 
 Check the box next to the item to be deleted and select the Remove 
User Permissions option from the Permissions tab.  
 ii. 
 In the delete confirmation window, click the OK button to delete the 
item. 
 Once the permission updates are complete, you are returned to the Permissions page, and the changes 
to the permissions are reflected. 
 Versioning List Items 
 Lists in SharePoint can be configured to maintain a history of the changes made to items contained in them 
so that all item iterations over the course of time are recorded. Versioning is made available in a list or library 
by enabling the versioning settings. Once these settings have been enabled all item changes will be tracked 
and content owners are able to view, manage, and restore earlier versions of items. 
 Enabling Versioning within a  List 
 To enable versioning within a SharePoint list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to enable versioning. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the List Settings option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Versioning Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Version Settings page, do the following:
 a. 
 In the Content Approval section, specify whether the item requires content 
approval. 
 b. 
 In the Item Version History section, select Yes to create versions. Optionally 
select whether to limit the number of versions tracked and how many to 
maintain. Also, optionally identify whether to limit the number of published, 
or major, versions against which draft versions should be maintained.  
 c. 
 In the Draft Item Security section, specify whether all users, only editors, or 
only approvers can see draft items. 
 d. 
 Click the OK button to save the version settings. 
 The version settings are saved, and you are returned to the List Settings page. 
 Accessing Version History 
 Once versioning has been enabled in a list, you can work with the versions. In a list with versioning enabled, 
you can view items’ previous versions. Version History options can be accessed by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to review the version history.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the list item’s menu, and then select the Version 
History option from the item’s hover menu. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
256
 Alternatively, you can access this information by doing as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to review the version history.  
 
 2. 
 In the list view, click the box next to the item to view version history, and then 
select the Version History option from the Item or File ribbon tab. 
 The Version History window (see Figure  6-23 ) is presented. This window provides access to all the 
version details for the selected item. 
 Figure 6-23.  Version History window 
 From the Version History window you can do the following:
• 
 View previous versions. 
• 
 Restore a previous version of the item to be the current version.  
• 
 Delete a previous version. 
 View Previous Versions of an  Item 
 To view a previous version of a list item from the Version History window, select the View option from the 
version item’s drop-down menu. This will open the details for the selected version.  
 Restore Previous List Item Versions 
 When you restore a previous version of a document or list item, that version becomes the item’s current 
version, the one available to all users accessing it. Restore a previous version when changes were made 
in error and you need to reset the item to an earlier state. To restore a previous version of a document or 
list item, select the Restore option from version item’s drop-down menu and click the OK button in the 
confirmation window. Doing this creates a new version of the item, one that is an exact copy of the version 
you chose to restore.  
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
257
 Delete a Previous  Version 
 Versions listed in the version history can be deleted by individuals with appropriate rights. To delete a 
previous version of a list item, select the Delete option from the version item’s drop-down menu, and then 
click the OK button in the confirmation window. To delete all versions of a list item, in the Version History 
window, click the Delete All Versions link, and then click the OK button in the confirmation window. 
 Content Approval 
 An additional feature of version management is content approval. When a list has content approval enabled, 
new items are added in a draft state and are only available to content approvers until the content is approved 
(enabling content approval is discussed earlier in this section). Use content approval when you want 
multiple users to be able to add or change content but want that information to be reviewed and approved 
before it is made generally available. 
 When a list has content approval activated and an item in it is updated, that item is saved with a 
Pending approval status. Do as follows to approve the item:
 
 1. 
 Select the item’s context menu, and from the hover panel menu select the 
Approve/Reject option. 
 
 2. 
 In the Approve/Reject window, update the approval status for the item, 
optionally add a comment, and click the OK button.     
 The approval status of the item is updated to reflect the selection made. If approved, content becomes 
visible to general site users. If rejected, it remains unavailable to them. 
 Users who have added items to the list can select the My Submissions view to see the current status of their 
items submitted for approval. This view presents all items each user has created and categorizes them by their 
approval status. If a content approver rejects an item, any comments the approver entered are also displayed in 
the My Submissions view in the Approver Comments column, allowing the submitter to understand why the 
rejection occurred. Each time an item in a list where content approval is enabled is edited, its status is set to 
Pending, and it must be approved again before the changes become available to users.  
 Item Validation  
 SharePoint can perform basic validation against list information being created or edited to ensure that it 
meets a set of business rules based on data constraints. An entire list or specific columns in it can have 
validation rules enabled. To configure validation rules, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to configure validation settings. 
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the List Settings option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Validation Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Validation Settings page, do the following:
 a. 
 In the Formula section, define the rules to use to validate the information 
added to the list. 
 b. 
 In the User Message section, enter the message to be presented to users to 
help them understand what they need to do to save information in the list.  
 c. 
 Once the information is entered, click the Save button to save it. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
258
 The validation settings for the list are now configured. Individual columns can also be configured when 
rules are specific to them. To configure a list column’s validation, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to add validation to columns.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the List Settings option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page in the Columns section, click the title of the column to 
which you want to add validation settings. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit Column page, do the following:
 a. 
  Select the Column Validation option to expand the column validation 
settings. 
 b. 
  In the Formula box, enter the formula to use to validate information entered 
in the column.  
 c. 
 In the User Message box, enter the text that will show users what the needs 
of the column are. 
 d. 
 Click the OK button to save the column validation rules. 
 Rating List Content 
 Lists can be configured to allow users to rate items in them. Content rating lets individuals see the value that 
others have placed on the information. Content rating can be configured as either star ratings, where content 
is rated on a five star scale (see Figure  6-24 ), or as Likes placed against the content (see Figure  6-25 ). Liking 
content and other social features are discussed in detail in Chapter   12 . 
 Figure 6-24.  Star ratings 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
259
 To use ratings, they must be activated within a list. To activate them, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to activate ratings. 
 
 2. 
 On the list’s view page, select the List Settings option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Rating Settings option from the General Settings 
section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Rating Settings page, do the following:
 a. 
 For the “Allow items in this list to be rated” option, select Yes. 
 b. 
 For the “Which voting/rating experience you would like to enable for this 
list” option, select Star Ratings if you want to manage ratings through a five 
star rating scale, or select Likes if you want to allow people to rate content by 
Liking it. 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The ratings for the list will be enabled. 
 Using Star Ratings 
 When a list is configured for star ratings, visitors are able to specify, on a five star scale, their item ratings. 
To rate an item within a list, click on the star that represents the rating you want to give the item. Once you 
select the rating, the item is updated to include your rating. That is, your rating is included in the item’s 
overall rating average and the total number of ratings. If the same user rates the item a second time, the 
previous rating applied is replaced by the newly selected rating.  
 Figure 6-25.  Like ratings 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WORKING WITH LISTS
260
 Using Like Ratings 
 When ratings are configured to let users Like the content, items are presented with Like details listed. The 
Like details, besides including the number of Likes an item has received to date, allow you to Like the item, if 
you have not yet done so, or Unlike the item, if you have already Liked it. To Like a listed item, click the Like 
link. This will update the item to include your Like and permit you to Unlike the item. If you choose to Unlike 
the listed item, clicking the Unlike option removes your Like and returns the ability to you to Like the item 
again. 
 Audience Targeting  
 Items within lists can be targeted to specific individuals or groups. When audience targeting is used and 
audiences are configured, web parts and personalization capabilities are able to filter the list details based 
on the targeted audiences. To enable targeting in a list, do the following.
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list where you want to enable targeting.  
 
 2. 
 On the list view page, select the List Settings option from the List ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Audience Targeting Settings option in the 
General Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Enable Audience Targeting page, check the Enable Audience Targeting 
option and click the OK button. 
 When audience targeting is enabled in a list, an additional field, Target Audiences, appears in the 
list item Edit form. That field allows you to select users and groups, as well as SharePoint groups as target 
audiences for the information. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, we introduced the various types of lists available to create in SharePoint 2016 discussing their 
structures and layouts as well as detailing the unique capabilities available across them. We discussed how 
to manage list content, editing items one at a time or groups of items at the same time. We also detailed how 
to manage security within lists and against items contained within a list. Lastly, we covered how to manage 
versioning and how to rate and target content.

 CHAPTER 7  
 Working with Libraries 
 Libraries are used to store and manage files within SharePoint. Whether you want to manage Microsoft 
Office documents, PDF files, images, videos, or some other type of file, you use libraries to store, track, 
and manage them. Chapter   5 discussed how to create and configure lists and libraries. Now this chapter 
discusses the different types of libraries available in SharePoint 2016 and how to create and manage content 
within them. 
 Types of  Libraries 
 There are several default library templates available in SharePoint 2016 that can be used to create new 
libraries in your sites. Several different types of libraries can be created to store and manage a variety of file 
types. Default libraries available in SharePoint 2016 include the following. 
 Document Libraries 
 The document library is the most general-purpose and commonly used type of library in SharePoint. 
Document libraries can store documents that need to be managed, edited, and shared within SharePoint, 
including Microsoft Office files, PDF files, and others (managing content in document libraries is discussed 
later in this chapter). When created document libraries contain only a single metadata column, which is 
used to store the document’s title. Document libraries can be updated after their creation to include other 
metadata columns to track details that need to be associated with the documents to organize, manage, and 
present them (configuring library columns and creating and managing views are discussed in Chapter   5 ). 
 When document libraries are created, they include only a single  view , the All Documents view. Views 
are used to organize and present documents within a library and the All Documents view lists all documents 
contained within the library. By default, this view shows the following details for each document:
• 
 Type (linked to document) 
• 
  Name (linked to document with Edit menu) 
• 
 Modified 
• 
 Modified By 
 When document libraries are added to pages within the site using their app parts, the information 
is presented in a standard library view (see Figure  7-1 ). From this view, you can perform all of the same 
management tasks available when working directly within the  library.     

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
262
 As with some of the lists discussed in Chapter   6    , document libraries support some extended capabilities that 
are not available across all libraries or lists. The advanced capabilities of document libraries include the following. 
 Incoming E-Mail Capabilities 
 As with some lists, a document library can be configured with an e-mail address. This allows e-mail message 
to be sent to the document library so the e-mail message and/or attachments to the e-mail can be saved. 
Incoming E-mail in document libraries is useful when you have systems that generate documents, such 
as reports, and are capable of distributing them via e-mail. These systems can be configured to e-mail the 
documents they generate to a SharePoint library for users to access. The saving of these documents can start 
a workflow process that can update, move, or manage these documents. Inbound e-mail routing can be 
configured to store documents attached to e-mail messages in the associated library or to store the e-mails 
themselves. When routed to a library, documents maintain their original name. 
 
■ Note   Before incoming e-mail capabilities can be configured within a library, your SharePoint technical 
administrator will need to configure your environment to support inbound e-mail. 
 To configure a document library to support incoming e-mail, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the document library where you want to configure incoming e-mail 
capabilities. 
 
 2. 
 On the document library view page, select the Library Settings option from the 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Incoming E-mail Settings option from the 
Communications section.  
 
 4. 
 On the Incoming E-mail Settings page, make the following selections:
 
 a. 
 In the Incoming E-mail section, select Yes for the Allow This Document 
Library to Receive E-Mail? option and enter the e-mail address for the 
document library. 
 Figure 7-1.  Document library  web part 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
263
 
 b. 
 In the E-mail Attachments section, identify how attachments in e-mails 
sent to the library are handled. Also, identify how files added to the location 
having the same name as items already there are handled by specifying 
whether these files are to be overwritten when new items with the same 
name are added. Options for handling attachments include these:
 
 i. 
 Save all attachments in root folder : Causes attachments to be placed 
in the root folder of the library. 
 
 ii. 
 Save all attachments in folders grouped by e-mail subject : 
Places e-mail attachments within a folder named for the subject 
of the e-mail message. 
 
 iii. 
 Save all attachments in folders grouped by e-mail sender : Places e-mail 
attachments within a folder named for the sender of the e-mail message. 
 
 c. 
 In the E-mail Message section, identify whether the e-mail itself is to be saved to 
the library. If you select Yes, the e-mail message will be saved as an EML file. If 
you select No, only the e-mail’s attachments will be saved to the library.  
 
 d. 
 In the E-mail Meeting Invitations section, identify whether meeting 
invitation messages are to be saved to the library if sent to it.  
 
 e. 
 In the E-mail Security section, specify whether e-mail messages are to 
be accepted into the library from any e-mail address or only from e-mail 
addresses associated with users having access to the library. 
 
 f. 
 Once all of the details are entered, click the OK button. 
 The inbound e-mail settings are activated, and e-mail messages sent to the identified address will be 
added to the library. 
 Form Libraries 
 Form libraries allow storage and management of InfoPath forms. They use an InfoPath form as the library 
template and allow for form fields to be displayed as columns within the library. Use form libraries when you 
need to collect information from users in a formatted or structured fashion and want this data saved within 
the XML-based form file or in a database. This data can then be used for reporting or integrated into related 
business processes. 
 For example, forms are valuable when you want to collect monthly expense details from your sales 
team. The form can be configured to manage the collection of all the necessary details and can then be sent 
through an approval process in which the submitter’s manager approves the expenses. After approval has 
been given, the information can be populated into the accounting system for payment processing. 
 When initially created, a form library, like a document library, includes only a Title field. However 
unlike a document library, a form library includes two default  views .
• 
 All Documents : This is the default view for a form library. It lists all forms located 
within the library. This view includes the following columns:
• 
 Type (icon linked to document) 
• 
 Name (linked to document with edit menu) 
• 
 Modified 
• 
 Modified By 
• 
 Checked Out To 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
264
• 
 My Documents : This view, which lists the library items created by the user viewing 
the library, includes the following columns:
• 
 Type (icon linked to document) 
• 
 Name (linked to document with edit menu) 
• 
 Modified 
• 
 Modified By 
 Adding Forms 
 The first step in using a newly created form library is to configure the form to be used within it. To do so, set 
the template for the library. The template identifies the information to be populated and the format of that 
information. 
 Managing Form  Templates 
 The form template for the library defines the structure and functionality provided by the form when it is 
populated by site users. To edit the form template for the library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the form library where the form needs to be populated. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the Document Template section, select the 
Edit Template link. 
 
 5. 
 In the opened InfoPath form, add the fields, logic, and formatting desired for the 
new form. 
 
 6. 
 Once all updates to the form are made, click the Save button, and select a 
location to save a copy of the form to. This can be any locally available location.  
 
 7. 
 Once the form has been saved, it can be published by selecting the Publish 
option from the File tab (see Figure  7-2 ) and then choosing the Quick Publish 
option.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
265
 
 8. 
 Once the publishing of the form is complete, click the OK button on the 
published confirmation window. 
 Once the form has been published to the library, it becomes the form displayed to users when they 
select to create a new item in the library. With the form published this way, no data from the form is 
displayed as columns in the library. This limits the visibility of the content. To override this, you can create 
the library and the forms for the library directly within InfoPath. 
 Figure 7-2.  InfoPath Publish  option 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
266
 Creating Form Libraries in  InfoPath 
 As you see, creating a form library and customizing the library template through SharePoint requires several 
separate steps to completely set up the library. The process has limitations in that the form’s fields are not 
included as fields in the library. An alternative method involves creating the form in InfoPath and then using 
the form publishing process in InfoPath to create the form library itself. This process will also publish the 
form to the library and expose the desired form fields as columns in the library. To use InfoPath to create a 
form library and publish a form for use in the library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Create an InfoPath form containing the desired layout fields and business logic.  
 
 2. 
 On the InfoPath File tab, select the Publish option. 
 
 3. 
 On the Publish page, click the SharePoint Server option.      
 
 4. 
 If the form is not yet saved locally, select to save it when prompted and identify 
a save location. This can be any accessible location. It has no direct relationship 
with the final form library or template once the item is published.  
 
 5. 
 In the first Publishing Wizard window, enter the URL for the SharePoint site 
where the form is to be created and click the Next button.  
 
 6. 
 In the second Publishing Wizard window, do the following:
 
 a. 
  Verify that the Enable This Form to Be Filled Out by Using a Browser option 
is clicked. This will render the form to be filled out in the web browser 
instead of requiring InfoPath to be present on a user’s computer to open 
the form. Rendering the form in the browser leverages SharePoint’s Form 
Services, which are available only in SharePoint Server Enterprise. 
 
 b. 
 Identify the type of object to create in SharePoint using the form. Options 
include the following. However, we will assume we are selecting the first 
option, Form Library, to publish our form.
 
 i. 
 Form Library : This is the most common type of object created. It is used 
to generate a form library in an identified site. 
 
 ii.  Site Content Type : This option creates a content type allowing the form 
to be associated with multiple form libraries within SharePoint. 
 
 iii.  Administrator-Approved Form Template : This option creates an approval 
request for an administrator to approve to create a new form template.      
 
 c. 
 Click the Next button to continue the publishing process. 
 
 7. 
 In the third Publishing Wizard window, either select to create a new form library 
in the specified site or select an existing form library to update the form template 
within. Then click the Next button. 
 
 8. 
 If you selected to create a new form library, in the fourth Publishing Wizard 
window, enter the name for the new form library and an optional description, 
and click the Next button. 
 
 9. 
 On the fifth Publishing Wizard screen, identify the fields from the form to include 
as columns in the library and the fields to be used as parameters for creating 
connections with other web parts for filtering purposes. Then click the Next 
button. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
267
 
 10. 
 On the sixth Publishing Wizard page, click the Publish button to publish the 
form. 
 
 11. 
 In the published confirmation window, click the Close button.  
 The form library is created, the form is made the template of the library, and identified form fields to be 
included as library columns are exposed to the library. 
 Filling Out Forms 
 To fill out a form published in a form library, users will choose to create a new document in the library. 
Doing this opens a new instance of the form to be filled out. Once the details are entered into the form, it can 
be saved to the library. An alternative method for completing a form in a library is to upload a completed 
copy of the form into the library. Adding and uploading documents into libraries are discussed later in this 
chapter. 
 Wiki Page Libraries 
 Wiki page libraries are SharePoint libraries designed to store and manage wiki pages (discussed in detail in 
Chapter   4 ). Many sites within SharePoint, such as those created based on the Team Site template, have a wiki 
page library, the Site Pages library, available by default. A wiki page library is also automatically added to a 
site when the Wiki Page Home Page feature is activated. You can also introduce new wiki page libraries into 
sites by selecting to create a new wiki page library. 
 Wiki page libraries, when created through the Wiki Page Library template, have a unique view when the 
library is initially accessed. It navigates the user to the default page in the wiki page library (see Figure  7-3 ). 
This  initial page describes what wiki libraries are and how to work with them. 
 Figure 7-3.  Wiki page library default page 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
268
 When created, wiki pages contain a single column, called the Wiki Content, in which page content 
details are stored. Also when created, wiki page libraries have several default views to help organize and 
manage contained wiki pages. These  views include the following:    
• 
 All Pages : The default view for the library, it lists all pages contained within it. Pages 
are sorted based on when they were last changed and include the following columns 
in the view:
• 
 Type (icon linked to document) 
• 
 Name (linked to document with edit menu) 
• 
 Modified By 
•

• 
 Created By 
• 
 Created 
• 
 Recent Changes : This view contains the same layout and structure as the 
All Pages view. 
• 
 Created By Me : This view lists the wiki pages created by the user viewing the library. 
The view lists the following library columns:
• 
 Type (icon linked to document) 
• 
 Name (linked to document with edit menu) 
•

 Picture libraries, specifically designed to store and manage image files, include all of the capabilities found 
in a standard document library, as well as the following additional resources for handling images:
• 
 Generation of thumbnail versions of files added to the library. The thumbnails are 
used in library views to preview images in the library. 
• 
 Preview views that show the thumbnails created from the images. They allow 
reviewing of image files in the library, as Figure  7-4 shows. 
 Figure 7-4.  Picture library preview view 
 The structure of a newly created picture library includes the fields in Table  7-1 .  
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES

 A picture library includes views with different displays of the picture details than those provided by 
other libraries. These views allow easy previewing of the files. The default set of views for picture libraries 
include the following:
• 
 Thumbnails : Shows the thumbnail previews for the images contained in the library 
(see Figure  7-4 ). It is the default view. Hovering over a thumbnail causes the image 
details—including the title, type, dimensions, and size information—to be shown 
over the top of the image (see Figure  7-5 ). Clicking the thumbnail image for a listed 
image opens the properties display form and shows all of the image properties. From 
this page, you can click on the name or image preview to open the associated image 
within the browser.

 Asset Libraries 
 Asset libraries include capabilities specifically designed to support management and sharing of images, 
audio files, and video files. When initially created, an asset library leverages the Image, Audio, and Video 
content types to allow collection of appropriate details supporting each of these media types. Table  7-2 lists 
the details tracked for images, audio files, and videos managed in asset libraries.

 Report Libraries 
 The Report Library template manages web pages and documents that relay analytical information to site 
users. This type of library has columns for storing metadata to help manage reports and includes two 
content types—Report and Web Part Page with Status List (see Table   7-3  ). The Report type can track and 
manage report files: Excel reports, PDFs, Word files, and others. The Web Part Page with Status List type 
creates web part pages with a status list web part and can be used to make online scorecards and reports.

 In a report library, items managed by Report content type function just as documents in any other 
document library do. However, the Web Part Page with Status List content type provides a unique approach 
to creating web part pages to be added to the library. To create a new Web  Part   Page with Status List item, do 
the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Report Library where you want to create a Web Part Page with 
Status List. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Web Part Page with Status List option from 
the New Document drop-down menu on the Files ribbon tab. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
277
 
 3. 
 On the New Web Part Page with Status List screen, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Page Name section, enter the filename, page title, and optional 
description for the new web part page. 
 
 b. 
 In the Location section, the report library will be listed. You can select this or 
some other report library in the site. You can also select the folder within the 
library where the page is to be created. 
 
 c. 
 In the Create Link in Current Navigation Bar section, specify whether a link 
to the page is to be created in the navigation bar and, if it is, what heading 
the link is to be placed under. 
 
 d. 
 In the Web Part Page with Status List Layout section, select the page layout 
to use in the web part page from the following choices:
 
 i. 
 Three Column Horizontal Layout : Creates a page containing two zones, 
with a larger left zone followed by a full-width page zone and then two 
sets of three side-by-side zones.  
 
 ii.  One Column Vertical Layout : Like the Three Column Horizontal Layout, 
this one has a set of two zones: a larger left and a single zone, then a 
single web part zone in the page.  
 
 iii.  Two Column Vertical Layout : Like the Three Column Horizontal Layout, 
this one has a set of two zones: a larger left and a single zone, then a two 
column web part zone area with the columns listed side by side.      
 
 e. 
  In the Status Indicators section, identify how a status indicator list is to be 
added, with options including the following:
 
 i. 
 Create a status indicator list for me automatically. 
 
 ii.  Allow me to select an existing status indicator list later. 
 
 iii.  Do not add a status indicator list to this dashboard. 
 
 f. 
 Once all information has been entered, click the OK button 
 The new web part page is created in the report library, and you are brought to the page to make any 
necessary updates. 
 Data Connection Libraries 
 Data connection libraries , available only in SharePoint Enterprise, are used to store and manage data 
connection files for use in Microsoft Office documents, such as InfoPath and Excel, that need to connect 
to other data. Data connection libraries store Office Data Connection files and Universal Data Connection 
files. They contain a content type for each of these types of connection files and include the fields listed in 
Table  7-4 .

 Unlike most other libraries in SharePoint, data connection libraries do not contain document templates that 
can be opened in the library and edited directly. Instead, the library supports only the upload of files for storage.  
 Data Connections Library  for PerformancePoint 
 The data connections library for PerformancePoint template is used to store and manage data connection 
files, much as the standard data connections library discussed earlier in this chapter does. However while 
the standard data connection library allows management of Office data connection files and universal data

connection files, the source data connections library for PerformancePoint introduces a third content type, 
PerformancePoint Data, which is used to manage connection files for data contained in PerformancePoint 
dashboards. This library template is available only in SharePoint Server Enterprise and only when the 
PerformancePoint Site Feature is enabled. The structure created from the data connections library for 
PerformancePoint is detailed in Table  7-5 .

 Working with Documents 
 Libraries store and manage a variety of types of files, from Microsoft Office documents and PDF files to web 
pages and data connections. Libraries provide you with the ability to work with the documents so you can 
locate and manage information you have been given rights to work with. 
 Adding Documents to Libraries 
 There are several different approaches available for adding documents to libraries. These options include 
approaches for uploading documents that already exist as well as approaches for creating new documents 
directly in the libraries. 
 Uploading Documents 
 When you want to place existing documents in SharePoint, several options are available for copying the 
items into the desired library. These options support both uploading of individual documents and multiple 
items at once. 
 You can upload individual files into a SharePoint library using the library toolbar. The toolbar is 
available when in a library view page or on pages where the library view web part has been added. The 
library toolbar contains an Upload option, as shown in Figure  7-8 . 
 To upload a document to a SharePoint library using the toolbar’s Upload option, do the following:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the library or page containing the library view app part.  
 
 2. 
 From the library toolbar, select the Upload option. 
 
 3. 
 In the Add a Document window, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Choose the Browse button and select the file to upload in the Choose a File 
section. 
 
 b. 
 Identify the upload behavior for the document if it has the same name as a 
file already in the library. Specify whether to add it as a new version of that 
file. If you choose not to allow this by unchecking the Add as a New Version 
to Existing Files option, an error message appears if you try to upload a file 
with the same name as one already in the library.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
285
 
 c. 
 In the Version Comments section, you can enter an alternate version 
comment. 
 
 d. 
 Once the details for the file to upload have been provided, click the OK 
button. 
 
 4. 
 If the document library has required columns, then the document properties 
window will be displayed. On this window, do the following:
 
 a. 
  Populate the columns for the document ensuring to populate any required 
fields. 
 
 b. 
 Click the Save button.  
 The document is added to the library and the identified metadata is applied to the document. 
 
■ Note   If you select Cancel in the document properties window instead of the Save option when there are 
required fields, the document is added to the library in a checked-out state. You must edit the properties to 
provide any required data before checking in the document. Since the document has not yet been checked in, it 
will be available only to the individual who uploaded it. 
 The second most common method for adding a document to document library is by dragging and 
dropping the document into the library view from some other library, network share or local drive. Doing 
this requires the use of an HTML5 compliant browser, such as Internet Explorer 10 or 11. When uploading 
a document in this way, any metadata columns associated to the document must be populated by editing 
the document properties once the upload is complete. If the library has required columns then the newly 
added document will be added in a checked out state requiring the columns to be populated before the 
document can be checked in. 
 A third option to upload a single document into a library is done using the Upload Document option 
from the Files ribbon tab. To upload a document to a library using the ribbon upload options, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to upload the file. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, click the Upload Document option from the Files 
ribbon tab, as shown in Figure  7-9 . 
 
 3. 
 In the Add Document window, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Find the document to add by browsing to it, then select it. 
 
 b. 
 Identify the upload behavior for a document with the same name as a file 
already in the library. Specify whether to add it as a new version of that file. 
If you choose not to allow this by unchecking the Add as a New Version to 
Existing Files option, an error message appears if you try to upload a file 
with the name of one already in the library. 
 
 c. 
 Add an optional version comment.  
 
 d. 
 Click the OK button. 
 
 4. 
 If the document has required metadata columns, the document properties 
window is presented where the document metadata can be populated. Once this 
information is entered, click the Save button. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
286
 The document is added to the library, and the identified metadata is assigned to the document. 
 While all the document upload options we have discussed so far work well for uploading individual 
documents, at times you may want to upload multiple items all at once. A couple of different approaches 
can be used to upload multiple documents into a library in this way. First you can use the same drag-and-
drop approach discussed earlier by selecting multiple documents instead of one. The second approach is to 
upload them through the Windows Explorer view. This view opens the library in an Explorer window, like 
the one you see when you browse through directories on your local computer. Then you can drag and drop 
or copy and paste files into the Explorer window. To upload files through Windows Explorer view, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library were you want to upload the files.  
 
 2. 
 Select the Open with Explorer option from the Library ribbon tab or click the 
Upload Files using Windows Explorer Instead link when on the Add a Document 
window. 
 
 3. 
 In the Windows Explorer window, drag and drop or copy and paste files from the 
other locations into the opened Explorer window.  
 
 4. 
 Once the files are uploaded, edit their properties to assign any required metadata 
column values, and then check the documents into the library. Editing document 
properties is discussed later in this chapter. 
 
■ Note   There are some restrictions to the types of files that can be uploaded into a library. For example, by 
default EXE and DLL files are not allowed. The file types not allowed in libraries are managed by your SharePoint 
technical administrator. 
 Creating New Documents in a  Library 
 As well as uploading existing documents into a library, you can also  create new documents within a 
library directly. This allows you to generate a new document in the desired library directly. To create a new 
document in a SharePoint library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to create the new document. 
 
 2. 
 On the document view page, select the type of document to be created from the 
New Document drop-down menu on the Files ribbon tab. If you click on the New 
Document drop-down option directly, the default document type will be created.  
 
 3. 
 The document will open in the associated document’s editing program. 
 A document saved from the opened program is saved in the library where you created the file.  
 Using the  New Document Menu 
 Whether you are working in a document library view page or through a library app part listed on a web part 
or wiki page, SharePoint 2016 has a New link in the toolbar of the app part. This link enables you to easily 
upload content and create new documents within the library. Clicking this link opens a list of new document 
activities, including a list of the possible documents that can be created directly in the library and a link to 
upload a document, as Figure  7-10 shows. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
287
 To create a new document in the site through the New link, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to create the new document. 
 
 2. 
 Click the New link in the document library view toolbar to show the Create a New 
File menu. 
 
 3. 
 In the Create a New File menu, click the type of document to be created.  
 
 4. 
 In the Create a New Document window, enter the name for the new document to 
be created. 
 
 5. 
 In the document’s Edit Properties window, enter the document property details 
and click the Save button. 
 The new document is added to the library. You can also use the New Document menu to upload a 
document to the library. When you select the Upload Existing File option from the New Document menu, 
you are prompted to identify the file and then the document properties, using the process described in the 
“Uploading Documents” section earlier in this chapter.  
 Editing Documents in SharePoint 
 Once documents are uploaded or created in SharePoint, the documents and their properties can be edited. 
Several capabilities exist within SharePoint to help you manage and edit documents. 
 Checking Documents In and  Out 
 Check a file out of a library when you plan to make edits and want to prevent others from editing the 
document until you are done with your edits. Checking out the file prevents others from editing the file 
until it is checked back in. Individuals visiting a library can see whether files are checked out and to whom. 
 Figure 7-10.  New document menu 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
288
For example, you may want to check out a file if you plan to make edits spanning several days. A checked-
out file, even when not open in a program such as Word or Excel, will be unavailable for edit by any other 
individual, and others will not see your changes until the file is checked back into the library. 
 To check out a document in a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to check out the document. 
 
 2. 
 Check the selection box next to the document or documents you want to check 
out, and click the Check Out option from the Files ribbon tab (see Figure  7-9 ). 
 The files are checked out, and the library view is updated. This update includes details about the 
individual who checked out the file, as well as changing the file’s icon to include the checked-out symbol 
(see Figure  7-11 ). 
 Figure 7-11.  Library view with checked out  documents 
 There is another method you can use to check out a file:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where the file to be checked out is located.  
 
 2. 
 In the library view, select the Hover Panel option. 
 
 3. 
 From the document’s hover panel menu, select the Check Out option from the 
ellipse’s Advanced submenu (see Figure  7-12 ). 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
289
 The document is checked out to the current user. Documents checked out are later checked back into a 
library using the same approach discussed for checking items out, the only exception being that the Check 
In option is used instead of the Check Out option. 
 Library managers can require that items in a library be checked out in order to be edited. To configure a 
library to require items to be checked out for editing, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where checkout is to be required.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Versioning Settings from the General Settings 
section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Versioning Settings page in the Require Check Out section, select Yes for 
the Require Documents to Be Checked Out Before They Can Be Edited option 
and click the OK button. 
 The library is configured to require documents to be checked out. With this option enabled, when 
you want to edit a document from a Microsoft Office program, you are prompted to check out the files 
(see Figure  7-13 ). Click the Check Out button to check out the associated file. 
 Figure 7-12.  Document’s hover panel menu 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
290
 Any file checked out to you can be checked back into the library. But if you want, you can also discard 
the checkout of a document. When you discard checkout, any changes made to the file since it was checked 
out are lost, and the file returns to the state it was in when you checked it out. To discard your checkout of a 
file, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where the checked-out file exists.  
 
 2. 
 Check the box next to the document to discard checkout, and choose the Discard 
Checkout option from the Files ribbon tab. 
 The file is checked back into the library, and changes made to it while it was checked out are discarded. 
Individuals with Full Control rights to the library can not only discard the checkout of files they had checked 
out but also discard the checkout of items checked out by others. Thus, administrators can override the 
checkout of these items, making documents checked out by other library users available for edit in their 
earlier state.  
 Editing Documents 
 A document in a SharePoint library is edited by opening the file in its associated program or, for a Microsoft 
Office document, opening it in Microsoft Office Web Apps. Clicking the name of a file in a library opens that 
file. A file associated with a program not in Microsoft Office opens in its associated program—for example, 
a PDF file opens in Adobe Reader. Microsoft Office documents, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 
files, open in either their associated program or in Microsoft Office Online Server. The way they are opened 
depends on the  settings of the library where the document is being opened. 
 Figure 7-13.  Microsoft Office Check Out prompt 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
291
 Managing Document Opening Settings 
 When your SharePoint technical administrator configures Microsoft Office Online Server within your 
SharePoint environment, Microsoft Office documents, including Word files, Excel spreadsheets, and 
PowerPoint presentations, are configured by default to open in Microsoft Office Online Server instead of 
their associated Microsoft Office desktop program. You can configure SharePoint libraries to determine the 
default program in which to open these files. To specify whether a Microsoft Office document is to open in 
the associated Office program or in Microsoft Office Online Server, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to edit the document opening settings.  
 
 2. 
 On the document view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the Opening Documents in the Browser 
section, specify the behavior for opening documents. One option is Use 
the Server Default. This is the default option where the library inherits the 
document-open settings defined by the SharePoint technical administrator. 
A second option is Open in the Browser, which opens files in Microsoft Office 
Online Server, letting you view and edit them in the web browser. A third option 
is Open in the Client Application, which opens files in the associated Office 
program. Once the setting is configured, click the OK button.  
 Even when the default opening behavior of files is defined, however, users of the library can still 
explicitly identify the method they want to use to open a file. 
 Opening Documents 
 You can open a document in a library for viewing or editing by navigating to the library and clicking the 
name of the document. When this is done, the document opens in the file’s default program. For Office 
documents, files open in either the associated Office program or Office Online Server, depending on the 
library settings. You yourself can also determine how to open a document by choosing the opening method.
• 
 Open in Program : To open the document in its associated program, display the hover 
panel, and select the Open in Word option from the ellipse submenu. 
• 
 Open in Browser : To open a Microsoft Office document for editing in Office Online 
Server, select the Open in Browser option from the hover panel menu. To open 
an Office document for viewing only, select the View in Browser option from the 
hover panel menu. This choice opens the document in the Office Online Server, as 
Figure  7-14 shows. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
292
 Office Online Server gives the web browser the full editing capabilities of Microsoft Office Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote. Use Office Online Server to open a document when your local computer does 
not contain a copy of Microsoft Office but you need to edit a document or when your computer’s version 
of Microsoft Office is not Office 2013 and you want to take advantage of capabilities not available in the 
installed earlier version of Office. 
 
■ Note   It is not required that you have Microsoft Office 2016 to work with documents in SharePoint 2016. 
You can manage documents within SharePoint using previous versions of Office, but you will be limited to the 
features available in your Office version. 
 Editing Document  Properties 
 When you work with documents in libraries, you can edit the information in the metadata columns. (How to 
create columns in lists and libraries to determine the metadata to manage is discussed in Chapter   5 .) To edit 
the properties of a document, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the document to be edited. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, check the selection box next to that document, and 
then select the Edit Properties option from the Files ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 If the library requires checkout and the document is not checked out, click the 
OK button in the checkout window. 
 
 4. 
 On the document’s properties edit page, make any needed changes to the 
document’s details. Once done, click the Save button.     
  Figure 7-14.    Word Online,  Office Online Server application            
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
293
 The document properties are updated, and you are returned to the document library view. 
 You can also edit a document’s properties by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the document to be edited. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Hover Panel option.  
 
 3. 
 In the hover panel, open the ellipse menu and select the Properties option 
(see Figure  7-15 ). 
 Figure 7-15.  Hover submenu 
 
 4. 
 If the library requires checkout and the document is not yet checked out, click 
the OK button in the checkout window. 
 
 5. 
 On the document’s properties edit page, make any needed changes to the 
document’s details. Once done, click the Save button.     
 The document properties are updated, and you are returned to the library view page.  
 Using  Quick Edit 
 Quick Edit, used to make multiple changes to a document’s properties, opens a SharePoint list or library 
view in a datasheet view resembling Excel (see Figure  7-16 ). 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
294
 To open a library in the Quick Edit view, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library in which you want to edit a file’s properties. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Quick Edit option from the Library 
ribbon tab. 
 The library appears in the Quick Edit view, where you can make needed changes to library properties. 
Changes are made individually, by typing in columns, or through multi-cell copy-and-paste actions, like 
those used to edit data in Excel files. Once done, selecting the View option from the Library ribbon tab 
returns you to the standard view of the library. 
 Managing  Files with No Checked-in Version 
 When a document is added to a library requiring checkout or is added without entering required metadata, 
the file is added in a checked-out state and must be checked in by its creator. Until a document is checked in 
the first time, other users of the library will not see it. 
 Library managers are able to manage files that have no checked-in versions. That is, they can manage 
files when their creator is not available to check them in the first time. To manage a file with no checked-in 
version, a library manager must take ownership of the file. To take ownership of a file with no checked-in 
version, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the file to be managed.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Manage Files which have No Checked-In Version 
option from the Permissions and Management section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Checked Out Files page (see Figure  7-17 ), check the box next to the file 
you want to take ownership of, and click the Take Ownership of Selection option. 
 Figure 7-16.  Quick Edit 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
295
 The file is updated to give the current user control of the checked-out item. Once the control is set, you 
can edit, check in, or delete the item from the library.  
 Deleting Documents in a Library 
 Documents within SharePoint libraries can be deleted by individuals who are able to manage library 
content. Several different approaches can be used to delete documents. To delete a single item from a 
library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to delete a document. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Hover Panel option to show the hover panel 
for the selected item. 
 
 3. 
 In the hover panel, select the ellipse menu, and choose the Delete option 
(see Figure  7-15 ). 
 
 4. 
  On the delete confirmation screen, click the OK button. 
 The file is deleted, and the library view is refreshed to reflect the change. The deleted file is moved to the 
site’s recycle bin (the recycle bin is discussed in Chapter   3 ). 
 At times you may want to delete multiple documents all at once. In this case, deleting items individually 
would not be efficient. Deleting multiple items at once from SharePoint libraries is done in one of two ways. 
The first method is as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the documents to be deleted.  
 
 2. 
 In the library view, check the box next to each item to be deleted, and then select 
the Delete Document option from the Files ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the delete confirmation screen, click the OK button. 
 The items are deleted from the library, and the view is updated. The deleted files are moved to the site’s 
recycle bin. 
 Figure 7-17.  Checked Out Files  page 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
296
 A second method for deleting multiple files is through Windows Explorer. To delete multiple files from a 
library using Windows Explorer, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the files to be deleted.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view, select the Open with Explorer option from the Library ribbon 
tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Windows Explorer screen, select the files to be deleted, and select to 
delete the files. 
 The items are deleted from the  library.  
 Editing Documents Through  Document Workspaces 
 A document workspace can be used to manage document editing processes. These sites are designed 
to facilitate comprehensive document management editing, including the management of supporting 
documents, links, and tasks related to the document’s update process. When a document workspace is used 
to manage editing, an editable copy of the document is placed in a workspace. The original document is left 
in its source location untouched until the workspace copy is appropriately updated and published back to 
the source. 
 To create a document workspace to manage a document’s editing process, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the document to be edited. 
 
 2. 
 On the document view page, check the box next to the document to be edited 
in a document workspace. Then select the Create Document Workspace option 
from the Send To drop-down menu on the Files ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Create Document Workspace page, click the OK button.     
 A document workspace is created (see Figure  7-18 ), and a copy of the selected document is placed in 
the workspace. You are brought to the workspace, where you can work on the document as well as manage 
any materials and information related to the edits you make. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
297
 A document workspace contains a set of resources designed to support the editing of documents, 
including the following:
• 
 Announcements list 
• 
 Calendar list 
• 
 Documents library, containing a copy of the document for which the workspace was 
created. 
• 
 Links list 
• 
 Team Discussion list 
 When working in a document workspace, you can use the available lists and libraries and create 
additional resources to help make necessary changes to the document. Once the document is appropriately 
updated, you can publish it back to the original source file by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Check the box next to the finalized file in the document workspace and select the 
Copy option from the Send To drop-down on the Files ribbon tab.  
 
 2. 
 On the Copy window, the original file location will be listed. Click the OK button.      
  Figure 7-18.  Document workspace 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
298
 Download a  Copy 
 Users of a SharePoint library are able to download copies of files from the library. That is, users can save 
copies of documents to another location they have access to, such as the local computer or an accessible 
network location. To download a copy of a file from a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the file to be downloaded.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Hover Panel option. 
 
 3. 
 On the hover panel, choose the Download option from the hover menu. 
 
 4. 
 In the Do You Want to Save… message, click Save or Save As and then choose the 
save location. 
 A copy of the file is saved to the identified location. 
 Working with Folders 
 Folders can be used in libraries to organize documents and to provide a container to uniquely secure 
groups of documents. By default, folders are enabled within libraries and can be nested into any needed 
hierarchy. A folder is best used when a set of documents to be stored needs to be secured differently from 
the rest of the library materials. Both the folder and the documents in it can be updated to reflect the files’ 
special security needs. 
 To create a new folder in a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to create the folder. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the New Folder option from the Files ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Create a New Folder window, enter the name of the folder to be created 
and click the Create button. 
 The folder is created, and you are returned to the library view. 
 
■ Note   Placing documents in a folder results in a fixed structure. Instead of using folders to organize 
content for display purposes, it is better to use the grouping capabilities against columns in views to create 
these structures. This approach allows you the flexibility to create multiple views and to organize documents in 
different ways. 
 Folders are most effectively used to secure groups of documents requiring special security. Doing this 
need not adversely affect the display of the documents in the library. If you configure the library’s views 
to ignore folders, you preserve the security you want, and the documents will be listed as if they are all 
contained in the root of the library. To configure a view to ignore folders in the display, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the folders to be ignored in the view.  
 
 2. 
 Select the library view that you want to update.  
 
 3. 
 On the library view page for that view, select the Modify View option from the 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit View page in the Folders section, select the Show All Items Without 
Folders option and click the OK button.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
299
 The library view is updated and shows all content without listing the folders. 
 Document Sets 
 At times multiple documents will make up what your organization considers a single piece of business 
content. For example, an RFP response may consist of a Word document response and a PowerPoint 
response presentation. Another example is a contract consisting of the original contract and one or more 
amendment documents. Not uncommonly, such a set of closely related documents need to share metadata 
properties, go through workflow processes together, or be subject to the same information management 
policies. A document set is a special kind of folder that allows multiple documents to be managed together 
and treated as if they were a single item. A document set can have:
• 
 Metadata columns that are shared with the documents contained within it. 
• 
 Workflow processes that can be run against the document set (workflows are 
discussed in detail in Chapter   9 ). 
• 
 Information management policies, such as retention or auditing policies, that can be 
configured within the set itself (information management policies are discussed in 
detail in Chapter   9 ). 
• 
 Versions assigned that group together the existing individual document versions into 
a comprehensive document set version. 
 The document set is a special content type that must be enabled within a library for it to be used. 
To  configure  a library to allow content types and to include document sets, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to enable document sets.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page, select Yes for the Allow Management of Content 
Types option in the Content Types section. Click the OK button. 
 
 5. 
 On the Settings page in the Content Types section, select the Add From Existing 
Site Content Types option. 
 
 6. 
 On the Add Content Types page:
 
 a. 
 Select the Document Set Content Types option from the Select Site 
Content Types From drop-down to filter the list of content types to only the 
Document Set type. 
 
 b. 
 Select the Document Set option from the Available Site Content Types 
section, and click the Add button to move the content type to the Content 
Types to Add section. 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
300
 The Document Set  content type is added to the library for use. The Document Set content type must 
next be configured to identify the display setting used when sets are accessed and the column properties 
that sets will share with contained documents. To  configure document set properties in a library where the 
document set content type has been enabled, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the document set to be configured. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Document Set option from the Content Types 
section. 
 
 4. 
 On the List Content Type page, select the Document Set Settings option from the 
Settings section. 
 
 5. 
 On the Document Set Settings page:
 
 a. 
 In the Allowed Content Types section, select the content types to be created 
within the document set. 
 
 b. 
 In the Default Content section, specify materials to be added to the 
document set when it is created by identifying the content type and then 
selecting the items to be added. Also, specify whether filenames, when 
added to the set, are to include the document set’s name. 
 
 c. 
 In the Shared Columns section, identify the metadata columns in the library 
to be inherited from the set. Documents added will inherit the values of the 
columns identified as inherited from the set. 
 
 d. 
 In the Welcome Page columns section select the library columns to include 
on the page displayed where navigating to a document set.  
 
 e. 
 In the Welcome Page View section, identify the library view to be used to 
display contained documents when the set is first accessed. 
 
 f. 
 In the Welcome Page section, select whether you want to change the 
layout of the welcome page (the page displayed when you navigate to the 
document set). A new window will open, in which you can tailor the page 
layout. 
 
 g. 
 Click the OK button to save the document set settings. 
 The document set is updated based on the changes made. With the set configured, you can create a new 
document set within the library. Do this as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to create the document set.  
 
 2. 
 On the document view page, select the Document Set option from the New 
Document drop-down menu on the Files ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the New Document Set page, enter the details for the new document set, and 
click the Save button. 
 The new document set is created, and you are brought to its welcome page (see Figure  7-19 ). 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
301
 Working in Document Sets 
 Once a document set is created, you can add and manage documents within it just as you  work with 
documents in any other library. (The only exception is that column properties inherited by the document 
set will be prepopulated with the values of those properties in the set.) While within a document set, you can 
view and manage its properties. As discussed earlier, the welcome page initially lists the details identified for 
display when the set was configured. Clicking the View All Properties link brings you to the set’s properties 
display page, where all the set’s details are shown. 
 When viewing the document set welcome page, you can edit the set’s properties. To do this, click 
the Edit Properties option and make any necessary updates to the details. When updates are made to set 
properties that are inherited by the documents in it, the properties of the contained documents are updated. 
 Document Set  Version Management 
 When versioning is enabled in a library that contains document sets, you can create document set versions. 
Creating a version of a document set identifies the version of each file within the set and ties them to the set 
version so that you can track and view the state of all the set’s materials when the version was created. 
 To capture a version of the document set, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the document set in which you want to capture the version.  
 
 2. 
 On the document set welcome page, select the Capture Version option from the 
Manage ribbon tab. 
 Figure 7-19.  Document Set  welcome page 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
302
 
 3. 
 In the Capture Document Set Version window, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Version Options section, specify whether the version is to include the 
latest major versions of contained documents or just the most recent version 
of each, whether it be a major or minor version.  
 
 b. 
 In the Comments section, optionally enter a comment to associate with the 
version. 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to save the version. 
 The version of the set is saved. To view the captured versions of a document set, navigate to it, and select 
the Version History option from the Manage ribbon tab. This will show the details for the saved version of the 
set, including references to the contained document versions (see Figure  7-20 ). 
 Figure 7-20.  Document set version  history 
 Managing Item Level Security 
 As discussed in previous chapters, security can be managed against sites, lists, libraries, and list items. 
You can also manage security for documents and folders directly within libraries. To manage security for a 
document or folder in a library, first configure the document or folder to no longer inherit its permissions 
from its parent library or folder. You can then manage the document’s or folder’s permissions directly. 
Typically you would edit the permissions when you want to restrict access to an item beyond the rights 
assigned to the library itself. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
303
 Managing  Permission Inheritance 
 As just noted, before you can change a document’s permissions, you must reconfigure it to stop inheriting its 
permissions from its library. To break inheritance on a document in a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library view showing the document that requires permissions to 
be managed. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the document whose permissions are to be 
managed by checking the selection box for the item, and then select the Shared 
With option on the Files ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Shared With window, select the Advanced option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Permissions page, update the permission inheritance settings for the 
document by doing the following:
 
 a. 
  To stop inheriting permissions, select the Stop Inheriting Permissions 
option from the Permissions ribbon tab. In the confirmation window, click 
the OK button. 
 
 b. 
 To reestablish inheritance between the library and the document, select the 
Delete Unique Permissions option from the Permissions ribbon tab. In the 
confirmation window, click the OK button. 
 Permission inheritance is updated based on your choices. Once a document or folder no longer inherits 
permissions from the library, you can set permissions directly against the item.  
 Editing Document Permissions 
 To change the permissions of a document or folder that does not inherit its permissions from the library, do 
the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library view showing the document to be updated.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, check the selection box next to the document, and then 
select the Shared With option on the Files ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Shared With window, select the Advanced option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Permissions page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 To add permissions:
 
 i. 
 Select the Grant Permissions option from the Permissions ribbon tab.  
 
 ii.  On the Share screen, enter the accounts to which permissions are to 
be added. If providing permissions other than Edit, click the Show 
Options item, and then select the permission level to provide. Once the 
appropriate permissions are set, click the Share button.      
 
 b. 
 To edit permissions:
 
 i. 
 Check the box next to the item to be edited and click the Edit User 
Permissions button from the Permissions ribbon tab. 
 
 ii.  On the Edit Permissions page, select the appropriate permissions and 
click the OK button.

 c. 
 To delete permissions:
 
 i. 
 Check the box next to the item or items to be deleted and select the 
Remove User Permissions option from the Permissions tab. 
 
 ii. 
  In the delete confirmation window, click the OK button to delete 
the item. 
 Once the permission updates are complete, you are returned to the Permissions page, where the 
permissions changes are reflected. 
 
■ Note   Resetting a document or folder to inherit permissions removes the security permissions you 
configured for the item and resets it to those of the parent folder or library. 
 Audience Targeting  
 In a document targeted to specific individuals or groups, web parts and library views can be configured to 
display the information only to identified users or groups. This is done by defining targeting settings for the 
item. To enable targeting within a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to enable targeting.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Audience Targeting Settings option in the 
General Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Enable Audience Targeting page, click the Enable Audience Targeting 
option and click the OK button. 
 When audience targeting is enabled in a library, an additional field, Target Audiences, is listed on the 
document’s Edit Properties form. This field lets you select users, groups, and SharePoint groups as target 
audiences for the information. 
 Document Versioning 
 As is discussed with lists in Chapter   6 , versioning is used to maintain a record of all changes made to a 
document over time. The version history lets you view past iterations of a document, along with the date, 
time, and editor of the document for each version. With versioning enabled, you can also revert a document 
to a previous version if necessary and compare the current state of the document to that of past versions to 
identify changes made to it over time. 
 Enable Versioning 
 To enable versioning for a document library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to enable versioning.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
305
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Versioning Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Version Settings page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Content Approval section, select whether the document is to require 
content approval. 
 
 b. 
 In the Document Version History section, select to either create major 
versions only or to create both major and minor versions. Optionally select 
whether the number of versions tracked is to be limited and, if it is to how 
many. Also, optionally identify whether the number of major versions that 
draft versions should be maintained for is to be limited and, if so, how many 
major versions should have minor versions. 
 
 c. 
 In the Draft Item Security section, identify whether all users, only editors, or 
only approvers are to see draft items. 
 
 d. 
  In the Require Check Out section, identify if items must be checked out for 
them to be edited.  
 
 e. 
 Click the OK button to save the version settings. 
 The version settings are saved, and you are returned to the Settings page.  
 Working with  Existing Versions 
 When versioning is enabled in a library and a document has versions created, you can access details of its 
past versions. To access the version details for an existing document, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to review the version history. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, open the document’s hover panel. 
 
 3. 
 On the document’s hover panel, select the Version History option from the hover 
panel’s ellipse menu (see Figure  7-15 ). 
 Alternatively, do the following to access this information:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to review the version history. 
 
 2. 
 In the library view, click the box next to the document whose history you want to 
view, and then select the Version History option from the Files ribbon tab. 
 The Version History window, shown in Figure  7-21 , appears. This window provides access to all the 
version details for the selected document. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
306
 When you access a document’s version history details, the version’s context menu can be used for the 
following activities:
• 
 View Previous Versions : Selecting the View option from the document version’s 
context menu opens the selected version for review. 
• 
 Restore Previous Versions : Restoring a previous version of a document creates a copy 
of the selected version and makes it the current version. To do this, select the Restore 
option from the document version’s context menu. 
• 
 Delete Previous Versions : Individuals with appropriate rights can delete specific 
versions of a file. To delete a version, select the Delete option. To delete all versions, 
select the Delete All Versions link in the version history window. 
 Content Approval 
 Along with versioning, content approval is used to help ensure the integrity of a document and ensure that 
only approved changes to it are available to its users (enabling content approval is discussed earlier in this 
section). Content approval lets multiple individuals edit a document but includes a set of people that must 
approve the changes made by these individuals before the changes to the document are seen by others. 
 To approve changes made to a document requiring content approval, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library view containing the document. 
 
 2. 
 Select the hover panel for the document to be approved or rejected. 
 
 3. 
 In the hover panel, select the Approve/Reject option from the hover panel’s 
Advanced submenu. 
 
 4. 
 In the Approve/Reject window, update the approval status for the document, 
optionally add a comment, and click the OK button.     
 The document’s approval status is updated to reflect the selection made. If the content was approved, it 
is made visible to site users. If rejected, the document will not become available to general site users. 
 Figure 7-21.  Version history window 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
307
 A user who has added documents to the library can select the My Submissions view to see the status of 
documents submitted for approval. This view presents all documents that a user has created and categorizes 
them by their approval status. If a content approver rejects a document, any comments the approver entered 
are also displayed in the My Submissions view in the Approver Comments column so that the submitter 
understands why the rejection occurred. Each time a document in a library where content approval is 
enabled is edited, its status is set to Pending. It must be approved again before the changes are available to 
users.  
 Copying  Documents with the Send To Option 
 The Send To option in document libraries lets you copy a document to another library in your SharePoint 
environment. When the Send To option is used to create copies of a document, a relationship between the 
source document and the copies is established. This relationship allows you to navigate between the original 
document and its copies. 
 To create a copy of a document using the Send To options, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the document to be copied.  
 
 2. 
 On the document view page, check the selection box next to the document, 
and select the Copy option from the Send To drop-down menu on the Files 
ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the Copy window, do the following:
 
 a. 
  In the Destination section, enter the URL to the library where you want to 
copy the file, and specify a name for the file. 
 
 b. 
 In the Update section, identify whether the author of the document is to be 
prompted to send updates when it is checked in and whether an alert is to 
be created for the source document so that the user making the copy is kept 
aware of updates made to the source document. 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button. 
 
 4. 
 In the Copy Progress window, click the OK button. 
 
 5. 
 Once the copy is created, click the Done button in the copy progress window.     
 The file is copied to the identified location. Once copies of a document have been created, you have the 
ability to view the copies by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the source document. 
 
 2. 
 On the document view page, check the selection box next to the document and 
select the Manage Copies option from the Files ribbon tab. 
 On the Manage Copies page, you can view and select listed copies (see Figure  7-22 ). 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
308
 The Manage Copies page allows the following:
• 
 Edit the Properties of a Document Copy : Selecting the Edit icon allows editing of the 
destination location and filename for the copy, as well as whether the author is to 
be sent an update when the document is checked in. You can also use this option to 
remove the link to this copy. 
• 
 New Copy : Allows you to enter details for a new copy, including the destination 
location and filename, and to identify whether an update is to be sent to the author 
when the document is checked in. 
• 
 Update Copies : Allows you to identify copies to be updated based on the content of 
the source. 
 When viewing a document that is a copy, you can get back to the source file the copy is based on by 
selecting the Go to Source Item from the Advanced submenu of the document’s hover panel. This will bring 
you to the source file’s document view page. 
 Item Validation  
 SharePoint has the ability to validate document properties when a document is added to a library and when 
the properties are edited. This allows you to add conditional validation requirements to your document’s 
details. To configure validation rules for a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to configure validation settings.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Validation Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 Figure 7-22.  Manage Copies  page 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
309
 
 4. 
 On the Validation Settings page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Formula section, define the rules to use to validate the information 
added to the library. 
 
 b. 
  In the User Message section, enter a message for users to help them 
understand what is needed to save the information in the library. 
 
 c. 
 Once the information is entered, click the Save button to save the 
information. 
 The validation settings for the library are configured. You can also configure validation rules for an 
individual column in a library when the rules are specific to the column and do not need to reference other 
columns. To configure validation for individual library columns, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to add validation to columns. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page in the Columns section, click the title of the column to 
which you want to add validation settings. 
 
 4. 
 On the Edit Column page, do the following:
 
 a. 
  Select the Column Validation option to expand the column validation 
settings. 
 
 b. 
  In the Formula box, enter the formula to use to validate the information 
entered in the column. 
 
 c. 
 In the User Message box, enter the text to show users to help them identify 
the needs of the column. 
 
 d. 
 Click the OK button to save the column validation rules. 
 The validation rule is configured against the updated column. 
 Document  Templates  
 Document libraries use template files to identify the type of file to create when you choose to create a new 
document in a library, and the document template the new document will be based on. Templates allow you 
to control the types of documents created within libraries. When you create a document library, as discussed 
in Chapter   5 , you can select from several document templates, including the following:
• 
 None : With this choice, the New Document option is not available in the library. 
Documents can only be uploaded to the library. 
• 
 Microsoft Word 97-2003 Document : A document created using the New Document 
option will be a Microsoft Word document ( .doc ). 
• 
 Microsoft Excel 97-2003 Spreadsheet : A document created using the New Document 
option will be an Excel spreadsheet ( .xls ). 
• 
 Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003 Presentation : A document created using the New 
Document option will be a PowerPoint presentation ( .ppt ). 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
310
• 
 Microsoft Word Document : A document created with the New Document option will 
be a Word document ( .docx ). 
• 
 Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet : A document created with the New Document option will 
be an Excel spreadsheet ( .xlsx ). 
• 
 Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation : The New Document option will create a 
PowerPoint presentation when clicked ( .pptx ). 
• 
 Microsoft OneNote 2010 Notebook : With this selected, the New Document option will 
create OneNote notebook files. 
• 
 Microsoft SharePoint Designer Web Page : A document created with the New Document 
option will be a SharePoint page opening in SharePoint Designer for editing.  
• 
 Basic Page : The New Document option will create a SharePoint Basic page.  
• 
 Web Part Page : The New Document option will create a SharePoint web part page.    
 After a library has been created, document templates can be edited to establish an appropriate starting 
point for new documents. For example, if the library will store case studies, the template can include a 
standard layout and standard content that all case study documents will include. To edit the document 
template for a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where the template needs to be edited. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page, select the Edit Template option in the Document 
Template section. 
 
 5. 
 In the opened document, make necessary updates to the file, and save the 
changes. 
 
 6. 
 On the Advanced Settings page, click the OK button.     
 The template is updated. Another approach to changing the library template is to replace the template 
file instead of editing the existing template. Replacing the template file allows you to use an existing 
document as the template for new documents created in the library. To choose a document as the template 
for the library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Open the library in Windows Explorer view, and ensure that the folder option to 
show hidden files and folders is in place. 
 
 2. 
 Navigate to the Forms folder (a hidden folder) in the Explorer view of the library.  
 
 3. 
 Copy the file to use as the template to the Forms folder.  
 
 4. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 5. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 6. 
 On the Advanced Settings page, update the filename in the Document Template 
section to the name of the new file you copied into the Forms folder. Click the OK 
button when done. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
311
 
■ Note   When a library is configured with content types enabled, you cannot edit the template for the library. 
With content types enabled, the templates are managed through the content types themselves. Content types 
are discussed in more detail in Chapter   8  . 
 Rating Library Content 
 Like lists, libraries can be configured to allow items in them to be rated by site users. Rating lets people 
declare their general opinion of the files and consolidates these opinions to give an overall evaluation of 
content. Content rating is configurable as a five star rating model or as Likes placed against items. To use 
ratings, the rating capability must be activated in the library.  Activate ratings by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to activate ratings. 
 
 2. 
 On the library’s view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Rating Settings option from the General Settings 
section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Rating Settings page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 For the Allow Items in This List to Be Rated option, select Yes. 
 
 b. 
  For the Which Voting/Rating Experience You Would Like to Enable for this 
List option, select Star Ratings, if you want the five star rating scale, or Likes, 
if people are to rate content by Liking it. 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to save the changes. 
 Content rating for the library is enabled. 
 Using  Star Ratings 
 When a library is configured for star ratings, visitors are allowed to specify, on a five star scale, a rating for the 
documents. To rate a document in a library, click on the star that represents the rating you want to give the 
document. Once you select a rating, the document is updated to include it. That is, your rating becomes part 
of the document’s overall rating average and increments the number of ratings placed against the document. 
If a user rates the document a second time, the previous rating applied is replaced by the newly selected one. 
Figure  7-23  shows a page with star ratings. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
312
 Using  Like Ratings 
 When ratings are configured to allow users to Like content, documents in the library appear with Like details 
listed. Like details show the number of Likes the document has received to date. Users can Like a document, 
if they have not yet done so, or Unlike a document, if they earlier Liked it. To Like a listed document, click the 
Like link. This updates the document to include your Like. If you decide to Unlike a document, clicking the 
Unlike option removes your Like and allows you to Like the document again. Figure  7-24 shows a document 
library with Like ratings enabled.

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
313
 Document ID Service 
 The  Document ID Service is a feature that can be activated in SharePoint to provide unique IDs to 
documents in a site collection. The feature creates a reference to the document that is consistent even if the 
document is moved around the environment as it matures. The ID is viewable on the document properties 
page, along with other standard document properties. When this service is active, the document acquires a 
URL that can be used to access the document regardless of its location. This URL has the following format: 
 http://<SiteCollection>/_layouts/DocIDRedir.aspx?ID=<DocumentID> 
 Once the Document ID Service feature is activated, you can configure the layout of the IDs created 
and specify the search scope to locate documents based on the ID. To configure the Document ID Service 
settings, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the site collection home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings 
menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Document ID Settings option from the Site 
Collection Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Document ID Settings page, identify the characters to use as a prefix for 
document IDs and the search scope for locating documents by ID. Then click the 
OK button to save the Document ID settings.

 Working with Documents in Office 
 There are several capabilities available in Microsoft Office to make working with SharePoint documents 
easier. 
 Saving Documents to SharePoint 
 Microsoft Office programs can natively save files in SharePoint. When you create a new file in Office or want 
to save an opened file to SharePoint for the first time, do as follows: 
 In Office 2013:
 
 1. 
 From the Office program’s File Menu, select the Save As option. 
 
 2. 
 On the Save As screen, select SharePoint. 
 
 3. 
 On the SharePoint screen, select the SharePoint location from the Recent 
Locations list, if it is there, or browse for a location option. In the Save As box, 
type the URL for your SharePoint site collection and navigate to the appropriate 
site and library from the listed locations. 
 
 4. 
 Enter a name for the file in the File Name field and click the Save button. 
 
 5. 
 If the document library where the file is to be saved has required metadata:
 
 a. 
  In the presented file warning message, click the Go to Document 
Information Panel button. 
 
 b. 
 In the Document Information Panel section (see Figure  7-27 ), enter the 
document metadata and click the Retry Save Button. 
 The document is saved to the library. 
 In Office 2016:
 
 1. 
 From the Office program’s File menu, select the Save As option. 
 
 2. 
 On the Save As screen, select the SharePoint location from the Recent Locations 
listed, as shown in Figure  7-25 . If the desired location is not listed, check the 
Browse option and type the URL of your SharePoint library. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
315
 
 3. 
 Enter a filename for the document and click Save. 
 The document is saved to the library. 
 Editing Document Properties 
 Document properties managed within SharePoint can be edited directly within Microsoft Office 2013 
from the Document Information Panel. To edit a document’s properties in Office, open the Document 
Information Panel in Office 2013 by selecting the File menu. On the Info page, select the Show Document 
Panel from the Properties drop-down menu (see Figure  7-26 ). 
 Figure 7-25.  Word 2016 Save As screen 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
316
 Figure 7-26.  Word 2013 File menu 
 In Microsoft Office 2016, there is no Document Panel. To edit a document’s SharePoint properties in 
Office 2016, select the Advanced Properties option from the Properties drop-down on the Info page. 
 Accessing Documents While Offline in  Outlook 
 Connecting SharePoint libraries to Outlook makes files accessible in an Outlook folder. When the 
connection is established, the files in the library are synchronized with Outlook and are available even when 
you are not connected to SharePoint. This approach works well for a set of documents you need to reference 
while traveling. For example, if you have a sales team requiring access to marketing materials wherever they 
are, you can synchronize these files with Outlook. This is done as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the document library to connect to Outlook.  
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Connect to Outlook option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 If a warning message is presented about access to content, click the Allow button. 
 
 4. 
 In the confirmation window, click the Yes button to confirm the connection with 
Outlook. 
 The library will appear in the SharePoint lists section of Outlook (see Figure  7-27 ). 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WORKING WITH LIBRARIES
317

■ Note   When you open a document in the Outlook view, the file is opened for offline editing. Any changes 
you make to the document from this view must be synchronized with the SharePoint library when the 
SharePoint server is available. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter we introduced the various types of libraries that can be created within SharePoint 2016 and 
discussed the purposes for each. We reviewed how content can be managed across these libraries. We then 
detailed how to work with content, including how to create files and edit and manage them within the 
libraries. We then reviewed folders and how to use them to organize content in a way that makes it easier 
to secure. We also discussed document sets and how they can be used to bring related content together 
and manage it as if the multiple items were one piece of content. We then detailed how to secure and target 
libraries and the documents contained within them. We discussed how to manage versioning content 
approval and ratings. Lastly, we discussed how to use Microsoft Office to work with documents stored in 
SharePoint.

 CHAPTER 8  
 Working with Site Columns, 
Content Types, and Term Sets 
 In the first seven chapters, we discussed creating and managing sites, which act as containers for content 
managed through SharePoint; pages, which present content and information to users; and lists and libraries, 
which are used to store content managed in SharePoint. In this chapter, we discuss site columns, content 
types, and term sets, all of which are used to standardize and centralize the management of list details and 
document metadata. 
 We use site columns to create centrally managed column definitions that can be reused across lists 
and libraries throughout your portal. Content types then combine site columns and other list and library 
features, including templates, information management policies, and workflows, into reusable definitions 
applicable across your SharePoint environment. Term sets are centrally managed hierarchical collections of 
data that can be used in list and library columns across your environment. 
 Site columns, content types, and term sets increase your control over SharePoint lists and libraries. The 
benefits they offer in managing and working with data include letting you:
• 
 Create information hierarchies as choices for list and library columns. For example, 
if you manage product-related information and want to track the combined 
Category, Brand, and Product hierarchy an item is related to, you can make columns 
that associate each item with the appropriate hierarchy. 
• 
 Create columns with choices that are standard across your environment. For 
example, if you need to track documents’ status, you can create a Status column with 
Draft, Pending Approval, Final, and Archived as choices then use this column in lists 
and libraries across your environment. 
• 
 Associate and combine columns with workflows and content policies to 
create standard document definitions. For example, to manage contracts 
across your environment, you can create a Contract document definition that 
includes standardized columns, workflows to perform contract approvals, 
and auditing and disposition processes to track and manage the contracts 
over time.  
 The aim of this chapter is to make you thoroughly familiar with the creation and use of these 
capabilities to enhance lists and libraries within your SharePoint environment. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS

 Site Columns 
 Site columns let you create reusable column  definitions in lists, libraries, and content types within 
SharePoint. There are several scenarios in which you might want to take  advantage of site columns in your 
lists and libraries. Site columns are typically used to address these situations:
• 
 You need to use the same column configuration in multiple lists and libraries—
for example, a column, Status, that is a choice list with specific values, such as 
Draft, Pending, Approved, and Expired, across multiple libraries throughout the 
environment. 
• 
 You want to create a column that will look up a list in a site from lists or libraries in 
other sites. For example, you created a list of departments in the root of your site 
collection and want lists and libraries throughout the collection to contain a lookup 
column that uses this departments list as the lookup’s source. 
• 
 You need to create content types that will contain column definitions. Content type 
columns must be built from  site columns.  
 Creating Site Columns 
 Where you create a site column impacts the scope of its availability and usability within the environment. 
A site column can be created in any site in a site collection hierarchy, but the column will be available only 
in the site where it is created and in subsites below it. For example, if your site collection has the structure 
defined in Figure  8-1 and you create a site column in the Information Technology site, the column will be 
available in the Information Technology site and its subsites, including Projects and Systems, but not in the 
Human Resources site or its subsites. 
 Figure 8-1.  Site  structure example 
 To ensure that a site column is available throughout your site collection, create it in the collection’s root 
site. When you create a lookup column site column, that column must be created in the same site as the 
list that is to contain the values to be made available (how lookup columns can be used to create a column 
whose values are selected from a list of items in a list or library is discussed in Chapter   5 ). For example, if you 
want to make a list of departments available for selection across several sites in your site collection, create 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
321
a Departments list in the root site of the site  collection  . You can then create a site column in the same site, 
also in the root, that references the Departments list. This site column can then be used in lists, libraries, and 
content types throughout your site collection. (Creating lists and libraries and creating columns in lists and 
libraries are also discussed in Chapter   5 .) 
 
■ Note   Since creating and managing site columns within SharePoint 2016 requires Manage Lists rights, you 
must have at least Designer rights within the site to make these adjustments. 
 To create a site column, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the column is to be created. As discussed, this is the 
site from which the column will be made available to the current site and its 
subsites. To make it available across your entire site collection, create it in the 
root site of the collection. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s  home page , select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Site Columns option from the Web Designer 
Galleries section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Columns page (see Figure  8-2 ), click the Create option.   
 Figure 8-2.  Site columns page 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
322
 
 5. 
 On the Create  Column screen , do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Name and Type section, enter the name for the new site column. 
Then select the type of column. All the column types and all the same 
configurations available for creating those columns in lists and libraries 
directly are available here, too (see Chapter   5 ). A couple of additional types 
of columns (discussed later in this section) are also available when creating 
site columns that are not available when creating standard list and library 
columns. 
 
 b. 
 In the Group section, select the site column group in which the site column 
is to be referenced. The Group selection is used to organize site columns 
for display in the site columns list and for filtering purposes when site 
columns are used in lists, libraries, or content types. This selection does not 
affect availability or functionality of the site columns but is used simply for 
organizational purposes. By default the Custom Columns group is selected, 
but you can select some other existing group or create a new group. 
 
■ Note To make site columns easy to find, it is a good practice to organize them into groups that represent 
their purpose. It is also a good practice not to add your custom site columns to the existing groups in which the 
standard SharePoint site columns are organized. This will make it easy to distinguish between standard site 
columns and those created by users. 
 
 c. 
 In the Additional Column Settings section, specify column-specific 
information for the column to be created. Optionally create a description 
for display below the column, and choose whether the column is to be 
required. Other settings listed vary with the type of column selected (these 
settings are discussed in Chapter   5 ). 
 
 d. 
 Click the OK button to create the new column. 
 The site column is created, and you are returned to the Site Columns page. 
 Additional  Column Types for Site Columns 
 When creating site columns, you have more choices than are available when creating standard columns in 
lists and libraries (as discussed in Chapter   5 ). Having more site column choices provides additional options 
for list and library columns when using site columns. Among the extra column types are the types discussed 
in the following sections. 
 Full HTML Content with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing 
 The  Full HTML Content with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing column type creates a column that 
supports full-featured HTML, including the ability to insert tables, links, pictures, video references, and 
embedded code. This column type, which works much as content zones do in a publishing page, includes 
no additional column settings when it is created beyond the standard optional description and requirement 
settings. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
323
 Image with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing 
 The Image with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing column type is used to create columns allowing 
selection of an image to be displayed in the list item or document details. This type also lacks settings 
beyond the standard description and requirement settings. 
 When this type of column is added to a list or library, a link that can be clicked to insert a picture is 
displayed (see Figure  8-3 ). 
 Figure 8-3.    Image with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing column 
 Figure 8-4.  Edit Image Properties window 
 Clicking this link brings you to the Edit Image Properties window (see Figure  8-4 ). 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
324
 The  Edit Image Properties window lets you specify the following about the added image:
• 
 Selected Image : Displays the image in SharePoint in the list item or document details.  
• 
 Image Rendition : Identifies the layout dimensions for the image to be displayed. 
Default options include these:
• 
 Full Size Image 
• 
 Display Template Picture 3 Lines (100 × 100)

 Display Template Picture On Top (304 × 100) 
• 
 Display Template Large Picture (468 × 220) 
• 
 Display Template Video (120 × 68) 
• 
 Alternate Text : Identifies the text to be presented when the mouse hovers over the 
displayed image. 
• 
 Hyperlink : Specifies a URL to navigate to when the image is clicked and specifies 
whether the URL is to be navigated to within the current browser window or in a new 
window. 
• 
 Alignment : Specifies image placement in the item display area. Options are:
• 
 Default 
• 
 Bottom 
• 
 Middle 
• 
 Top 
• 
 Left 
• 
 Right 
• 
 Top of Text 
• 
 Middle of Text 
• 
 Bottom of Text 
• 
 Border Thickness : Identifies whether a border is to surround the image and, if it is, 
identifies its thickness in pixels ( setting the border thickness to 0 pixels will not 
include a border). 
• 
 Horizontal Spacing : Identifies the padding spacing to be placed to the left and right 
of the image when it appears. 
• 
 Vertical Spacing : Identifies the padding spacing to be placed to the top and bottom of 
the image when it appears. 
• 
 Size : Specifies the size of the image display in the column. Options are:
• 
 Use Default Image Size : Shows the image at its actual size. 
• 
 Specify Size: Identifies the width or height, using the Maintain Aspect Ratio 
option to keep the image’s proportions intact or specifying both width and 
height to set the image to a specific size.

 Hyperlink with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing 
 The Hyperlink with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing column type allows creation of hyperlink 
fields in which you can select a hyperlink to be displayed. This column type has no additional configuration 
settings beyond the optional description and requirement settings all columns have. 
 A column created from the Hyperlink with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing column type 
presents a link for accessing the hyperlink configuration options used to select or enter a URL to add to the 
list or document properties (see Figure  8-5 ). 
 Figure 8-5.    Hyperlink with Formatting and Constraints for Publishing field 
 Figure 8-6.  Summary Links Data field 
 When you select the Click to Add a New Hyperlink option, the Edit Hyperlink Properties window 
appears. It allows selection or entry of a URL. In the Edit Hyperlink Properties window, enter the following 
information:
• 
 Selected URL : Allows you to browse to an item in the site collection to reference by 
its URL or enter a URL to an internal or external web location. You can also specify 
whether the link opens in the current window or a new one and whether the link 
display includes the item type icon. For example, if the link is to a Word document, 
the Word icon would appear with the link. 
• 
 Display Text : Specifies a name for the URL. 
• 
 ToolTip : Identifies any text to appear when the mouse hovers over the hyperlink field.  
 Summary Links Data 
 The Summary  Links Data column type lets you create site columns that provide the same capabilities seen 
in the Summary Links web part (discussed in Chapter   4 ). Like the other columns described, this one has no 
configuration settings beyond the optional description and requirement details. 
 With a column in place based on the Summary Links Data field type, while editing items in a list, you 
have options for managing multiple links in the field (see Figure  8-6 ). 
 The summary link field details will only be visible when editing the list item, not while adding them. 
Within the field, you have the following options:
• 
 New Link : To add a new link to the field. Clicking the New Link option opens the New 
Link form, on which you can enter the following details.
• 
 Create a link either to an item or to a person. 
• 
 If you choose to create a link to a person, enter or select the person the link is to 
reference. 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS

• 
 A title for the new link. 
• 
 Optionally enter a description of the link. 
• 
 The link URL that can be entered or browsed to.  
• 
 Specify whether the link opens in the current browser window or a new one. 
• 
 Optionally enter a tool tip to appear when hovering over the link. 
• 
 Optionally select an image to associate with the link. 
• 
 Identify a description to be displayed when hovering over the optional image.  
• 
 Select an optional group within which the link is to be organized.  
• 
 Specify a style for the image and define its layout with style options. 
• 
 New Group : To create groups under which links can be organized. If you choose this 
option, you identify a name for the group to be created. 
• 
 Configure Styles and Layout : To define style options for the link’s appearance. 
Choices include the following:
• 
 The default style for newly created links. 
• 
 The style that any existing links are to be changed to. 
• 
 The style for listed group headers. 
• 
 The number of columns the links are to be presented within. 
• 
 Reorder : To update the listed items’ order by rearranging them as desired.     
 Rich Media Data for Publishing 
 The  Rich Media Data for Publishing column type permits selection of a video or audio file to be referenced 
and played in the list or document properties view. A site column created with this column type has no 
settings beyond the optional description and requirement settings. When added, this column is configured 
through the Click Here to Configure option (see Figure  8-7 ). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
327
 When this link is clicked, the Media ribbon tab appears to allow media configuration settings. These 
settings let you do the following:
• 
 Identify the media file to reference. You can select a file from the local computer and 
specify where it is to be placed. You can reference a file already in SharePoint or a 
file that exists in some other location, or you can remove references to a media file 
already selected. 
• 
 Identify an image preview to represent the audio or video file when it is not playing. 
You can select a local computer file and specify where to place it, reference a 
file already in SharePoint or a file existing in some other location, or remove the 
reference to an already selected preview image. 
• 
 Enter the title for the item. 
• 
 Identify whether the video is start playing automatically when displayed. 
• 
 Identify whether playback is to continually loop or end when done playing. 
• 
 Specify either the player’s horizontal or vertical size (in pixels) with the aspect ratio 
maintained or both horizontal and vertical size without maintaining the aspect ratio. 
 Adding and Configuring Site Columns in Lists and Libraries 
 Site columns can be added as columns in lists and  libraries  . The Departments list example in the "Creating 
Site Columns" section mentions how to maintain a list of departments in the root site of your site collection 
and then create a site column in the same site that is a Lookup column pointing to the Departments list. You 
can then add this site column to any list or library in any site in the collection. By doing this you create, in 
any list or library, a central Department lookup column that lets you select a department from the items in 
the Departments list. 
 Figure 8-7.  Rich Media Data for Publishing field 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS

 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page in the Columns section, select the Add from Existing Site 
Columns option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Add Columns from Site Columns page, do the following:
 
 a. 
  Select the group containing the column or columns to be added. This will 
filter the list of available site columns to only those associated with the 
selected group. 
 
 b. 
  Select the site columns to add to the list or library from the Available Site 
Columns, and click the Add button to move the column to the Columns to 
Add section. 
 
 c. 
 Identify whether the column or columns are to be added to the default view 
of the list or library. 
 
 d. 
 Click the OK button. 
 The site column is added to the list or library columns. You can then configure the column settings for 
the specific list or library by doing as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the column to configure.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab.

 Editing  Existing Site Columns 
 You can edit an existing site column in your SharePoint environment to change its name, group, and specific 
column type settings. A site column must be edited in the site where it was created. To edit an existing site 
column, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the site column was created.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Site Columns option from the Web Designer 
Galleries section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Columns page, click the name of the site column to be edited. 
 
■ Note If the site column name cannot be clicked, the current site is not where the column was created. In 
this case, you can identify where the site column was created in the Source column of the view. 
 
 5. 
 On the Edit Column page, do the following:
 
 a. 
  Make any necessary updates to the column details.  
 
 b. 
 Identify whether all list columns based on this site column are to be updated 
to reflect your changes. 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The site column is updated. If you chose to update all columns based on this site column, then all list 
and library columns using this site column are updated.  
 Deleting Existing Site Columns 
 Site columns within SharePoint can also be deleted. As when you edit a site column, you delete a site 
column from the site where the column was created. To delete an existing site column, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the site column was created.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Site Columns option from the Web Designer 
Galleries section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Columns page, click the name of the site column to be edited.  
 
 5. 
 On the Edit Column page, click the Delete button.  
 
 6. 
 In the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The site column is deleted, and you are returned to the Site Columns page. However lists and libraries 
with the site column will still contain the field. The existing field in the lists and libraries will become 
standard list fields that would no longer be related to each other.   

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
330
 Content Types 
 Content types are content  definitions used in lists and libraries to specify details about information to 
be stored, including column definitions for the content, workflows to be run on the content, information 
management policies defined for the content, and, for libraries, document templates for creating content. 
Content types also let you store multiple types of content with different content definitions in a list or library, 
since more than one content type can be associated with a single list or library. 
 Content types are hierarchical. When you create a content type, you base it upon an existing type. The 
new content type inherits the settings and properties of the selected parent. In taking advantage of these 
inheritance settings, you create a hierarchy of content types. Say, for example, that you define a document 
type called a Customer Document to include Customer as a required field, one that must be entered when 
new documents of this type are created. This Customer Document content type will be based on the 
Document content type. It inherits the document definition and adds the Customer field to the definition. 
You can then create a  Project Documents content type and a Sales Documents content type, both based 
on the Customer content type. For the Project Documents type, you might create a column, Project, to be 
entered in the document and add it to the required Customer field. For Sales Documents, you might require 
fields identifying the product being sold and include a specific document template to be used when new 
sales documents are created. 
 Creating and  Configuring Content Types 
 Like site columns, content types can be created at any level of your SharePoint site collection and will be 
available only in and below the site where it is created. For example, if your site structure is the one shown in 
Figure  8-8 and we create a content type in the Information Technology site, the content type will be available 
only in that site and its contained Projects and Systems sites. To have a content type available throughout the 
site collection, create it in the root site of the collection. 
 Figure 8-8.  Sample site structure 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
331
 Content types can be shared across site collections through the use of Content Type Hubs, SharePoint 
sites defined as locations with content types shareable across site collections. Your SharePoint technical 
administrator can identify site collections containing such shareable content types. 
 To create a new content type within a site, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to create the new content type.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Site Content Types option from the Web 
Designer Galleries section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Content Types page, click the Create option. 
 
 5. 
 On the New Site Content Type page, do the following:
 
 a. 
  Enter the name for the new content type to be created.  
 
 b. 
 Enter an optional description of the content type. 
 
 c. 
 In the Parent Content Type section, select the group containing the content 
type to use as the parent for the new content type to filter the listed content 
types by the selected group. Then select the content type to be used as the 
parent content type for the new one. 
 
 d. 
  In the Group section, identify the group under which to store the new 
content type, or enter a name for the new group to be created. 
 
 e. 
 Once the information is entered, click the OK button. 
 The content type is created. You are taken to the Site Content Type page for the newly created 
content type. 
 Configuring and Editing an Existing Content Type 
 Once you create the content type, you need to configure it.  Configuring   a content type is similar to 
configuring a list or library and includes doing the following:
• 
 Identifying the site columns to be used in the content type and defining the ordering 
and requirement settings of the columns.  
• 
 Configuring any workflows to be made available to the content type’s content.  
• 
 Defining any information management policies to be applied to the content type’s 
content. 
 As your needs for the content type change and mature, you can update the content type details to align 
with the changing needs. 
 Editing General Content Type Details 
 To edit the name, description, and group  information entered when the content type was created, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the content type was created. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.

information as necessary. Then click the OK button. 
 The general details for the content type are updated, and you are returned to the Site Content 
Type page. 
 Configuring Content Type Advanced Settings 
 Along with general  settings , you can also configure advanced settings for the content type. These include 
changes to the document template. To configure these advanced settings for a content type, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the content type was created 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Site Content Types option from the Web 
Designer Galleries section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Content Types page, click the name of the content type to be edited. 
 
 5. 
 On the Site Content Type page for the content type to be edited, click the 
Advanced Settings link from the Settings section. 
 
 6. 
 On the Advanced Settings page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 When the content type is based on a document-centric content type, the 
Document Template section will be available. In this section, you can enter 
the URL for a document to be used as the template for the content type or 
choose to upload a document template to use as the document template for 
the content type. 
 
 b. 
 In the Read Only section, specify whether the content type is to be alterable. 
If the setting is Read-Only, no change to the content type will be permitted.  
 
 c. 
 In the Update Sites and Lists section, identify whether changes made to the 
template and read-only settings are to be inherited by all lists and libraries 
where the content type is in use. 
 
 d. 
  Once all information has been entered, click the OK button to save the 
information. 
 The changes to the document template and the read-only settings are updated. If you chose to update 
all lists and libraries where the content type is in use, all of these lists and libraries are updated to reflect the 
changes made. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS

 To edit an existing workflow:
 
 i. 
 Click the name of the workflow to be edited. 
 
 ii.  Edit the details of the workflow (editing workflows is discussed in detail 
in Chapter   9 ). 
 The workflows are appropriately updated for the content type. 
 Managing a Content Type’s Information Management Policies 
 Information management  policies , which define auditing, retention, barcoding, and labeling requirements 
for items, can be configured for content types. To configure information management policies for a content 
type or to edit an existing policy, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the content type was created. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3.

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
334
 Managing Content Type Document Information Panel Settings 
 When a content type is based on a document parent type, you can also change the document information 
panel  settings  for the content type, allowing you to change the information panel, discussed in Chapter   7 , 
when working with Microsoft Office documents. You can edit the existing information management panel 
or select a new panel. To manage the information management panel settings for a content type, do the 
following:

Document Information Panel Settings link in the Settings section. 
 
 6. 
 On the Document Information Panel Settings page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Document Information Panel Template section, identify whether 
the Microsoft Office Document Information Panel is to show the default 
template, an existing custom template, or a new custom template to be 
uploaded or created in place. 
 
 b. 
 In the Show Always section, identify whether the document information 
panel is to open automatically when the document opens.  
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button when the document information panel settings updates 
are complete. 
 The document information panel settings are saved, and you are returned to the Site Content Type page 
for the associated content type. These settings will only apply when using Microsoft Office versions prior to 
Microsoft Office 2016 since Office 2016 no longer includes the document information panel. 
 Adding  Site Columns to Content Types 
 Columns for the content type can be defined and changed, although only site columns can be used within 
content types. You can select existing site columns or create new ones when working within a content type. 
To add existing site columns to the content type, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the content type was created. 
 
 2.

 a. 
 In the Column Order section, change the position from top numbers to set 
the sort order for the columns. 
 
 b. 
 In the Update Sites and Lists section, identify whether the ordering changes 
are to be inherited by content types based on this type. 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The changes are made, and you are returned to the Site Content Type page for the associated 
content type. 
 Deleting Content Types 
 Content types not in use in lists or libraries can be deleted. If you try to delete a content type that is in use, a 
message indicating that the type is in use appears, and deletion is not allowed. To delete a content type not 
in use, do the following:

Content Type link from the Settings section. 
 
 6. 
 In the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The content type is deleted, and you are returned to the Site Content Types page.  
 Configuring Content Types for Lists and Libraries 
 Once content types have been created and properly configured, lists and libraries can be updated to 
use them. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
338
 Enable the Use of Content Types in Lists and Libraries 
 Before enabling a content type for use in a list or library, you must enable the list or library to support the use 
of content types. To enable the use of content types in a list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to enable content types. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the Content Types section, select Yes for the 
Allow Management of Content Types? option and click the OK button. 
 The ability to manage content types within the list or library is enabled, and the Content Types section 
is added to the Settings page, where you can manage content type details for the list or library. 
 Adding Content Types to Lists and Libraries 
 After enabling the management of content types in a list or library, you can add an existing content type for 
use there. Do so as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to add content types.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, click the Add From Existing Site Content Types option in 
the Content Types section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Add Content Types page, do the following:
 
 a. 
  Select the group in which the content type exists from the group’s drop-
down in order to filter the list or content types to include only those 
contained in the selected group. 
 
 b. 
  Select the content type to add in the Available Site Content Types list, and 
click the Add button to add the selected type to the Content Types to Add 
section. 
 
 c. 
 Once the desired content type has been added to the Content Types to Add 
section, click the OK button. 
 The content type is added to the list or library. 
 Managing Content Type  Defaults and Order in a List or Library 
 Once content types are added to a list or library, they can be managed. Management of content types 
includes specifying which of the available ones is the default for the list or library and identifying the order of 
the listed content types and whether the listed types are visible to users when adding new items. To manage 
these content types, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where content types need to be managed. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
339
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Change New Button Order and Default Content 
Type option from the Content Types section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Change New Button Order page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Identify the order of the listed content types by updating the Position from 
Top value. Placing an item in the first position makes that item the default 
content type for the list or library. 
 
 b. 
  Identify whether a content type is to be visible. Unchecking the Visible 
option in front of the item makes it unavailable for selection when creating 
new items. 
 
 c. 
 Once all cha nges are made, click the OK button to save the changes. 
 The updates to the content type ordering and visibility details for the list or library are saved.  
 Deleting a Content Type from a List or Library 
 You can remove content types from a list or library as long as at least one content type is left. To remove a 
content type, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to remove the content type.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, click the name of the content type to delete from the 
Content Types section. 
 
 4. 
 On the List Content Types page, click the Delete this Content Type option from 
the Settings section. 
 
 5. 
 In the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The content type is removed from the list or library, and you are returned to the Settings page. Deleting 
a content type from a list or library only removes it from the list or library. It does not delete the content type 
from SharePoint. 
 Configuring Content Type Settings in a List or Library 
 In a content type available in a list or library, you can configure several content type settings for that instance 
of the content type. Your configuration settings will impact the content type only in that list or library, not in 
other locations in the environment. Configurable settings for the current list or library instance of a content 
type include the following:
• 
 Name and Description : The name of the content type as it exists in the list or library, 
along with its optional description. 
• 
 Advanced Settings : For libraries, the document template available when new 
documents are created using the content type can be updated. You can also identify 
whether the content type is read-only in the list or library. 
• 
 Workflow Settings : Allows you to add, alter, or delete workflows affecting the content 
type (workflows are discussed in detail in Chapter   9 ). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
340
• 
 Information Management Policy Settings : Lets you create additional information 
management policies affecting the content type in the current list or library. You 
can also edit and delete existing policies (information management policies are 
discussed in detail in Chapter   9 ). 
• 
 Document Information Panel Settings : In document libraries, their Microsoft Office 
application ribbon settings can be managed or altered. 
 You alter any of these options in the Settings page of the list or library by selecting the appropriate 
content type to manage and then selecting the appropriate option from the list’s or library’s Content 
Type page. 
 Working with Content Types in a List or Library 
 With content types enabled in a list or library, you create new items based on the content type by clicking 
the New Item option from the Items ribbon tab or New Document option from the Files ribbon tab. The 
new item is created based on the default content type in that list or library. When multiple content types are 
associated with a list or library, the New Item or New Document option also includes a  drop-down menu 
from which you select the content type to base a new item on. You create a new item in a list or library based 
on a specific content type by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to create the new item. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 For lists, select the content type from the New Item drop-down menu on the 
Items ribbon tab. 
 
 b. 
 For libraries, select the content type from the New Document drop-down 
menu on the Files ribbon tab (see Figure  8-9 ). 
 Figure 8-9.  New Document drop-down menu 
 The new item is created based on the selected content type. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
341
 To upload a document to a library configured with multiple content types, identify the content type on 
which the document is to be based in the Edit Properties window that appears after the file to upload has 
been selected (see Figure  8-10 ). 
 Figure 8-10.  Document Edit Properties window 
 In the  Edit Properties, window the content type is initially set to the library’s default type. To update 
it, select any available content type. When a content type is selected, the listed document properties are 
updated to reflect those configured for the selected type. 
 Term Sets 
 Terms are stored in term sets. Term sets are sets of hierarchical values that allow you to create formal 
taxonomies within SharePoint. Term sets are managed within term stores. A  term store (see Figure  8-11 ) 
enables you to manage all  aspects of term sets, including structures, contained terms, and security.  
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
342
 Term sets are used in SharePoint for the following:
• 
 To create a set of standard values for use as metadata in list or library columns.  
• 
 To control the site navigation options available in the SharePoint site (navigation 
management is discussed in detail in Chapter   3 ). 
 Term sets can be  created to be available within a single site collection or across your SharePoint 
environment. Making a term set available across site collections must be done by your SharePoint technical 
administrator. Once created, terms within a set can be managed by anyone with appropriate rights 
(managing terms is discussed later in this chapter). 
 Term Store Administration 
 Management of term sets and terms is handled by term store administrators, who are defined in the 
Term Store Administration area. To specify which individuals have the ability to  manage   term sets, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in your site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 Figure 8-11.    Term Store management  tool         
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
343
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page in the Site Administration section, click the Term Store 
Management option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Term Store Management Tool page (see Figure  8-11 ) in the Term Store 
Administrators section, add the users who are to get administration rights to the 
term store. Then click the Save button. 
 The term store administrators list is updated based on the changes made.  
 Managing Term Sets 
 Term store administrators can create and manage term sets and terms within those sets. 
 Adding Term Sets and Terms 
 There are two approaches to adding term sets and terms to the term store. You can create term sets and 
terms directly in the store or import terms by using a CSV file. To import a term set from a CSV file, first 
create a CSV file having the appropriate structure and information to import. SharePoint includes a sample 
import file that you can review to understand the format for importing term sets. To access the sample 
import file, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in your site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page in the Site Administration section, click the Term Store 
Management option. 
 
 4. 
 On the Term Store Management Tool page, click the View a Sample Import File 
option from the Sample Import section of the page. 
 
 5. 
 From the Open or Save prompt, select the Open option. 
 The sample term set import file is opened (see Figure  8-12 ). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
344
 Once you have created and properly configured your term set import file, you can import a term set by 
doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the collection where you want to create the term set. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, click the Term Store Management option from the Site 
Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Term Store Management Tool page, select the Import Term Set option 
from the desired group’s context menu (see Figure  8-13 ). 
 Figure 8-12.  Sample term set import file

 5. 
 In the Term Set Import window, select the CSV file to import and click the OK button.  
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
345
 The term set is imported, and you are returned to the Term Store Management Tool page. As mentioned 
earlier, you can also create term sets and their contained terms directly in the term store management page. 
To create a term set in the term store, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the collection where you want to create the term set. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, click the Term Store Management option from the Site 
Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Term Store Management Tool page, select the New Term Set option from 
the desired group’s context menu (see Figure  8-13 ). 
 
 5. 
 In the newly created term set box (see Figure  8-14 ), enter a name for the new 
term set. 
 Figure 8-14.  New term set entry box

 7. 
 In the newly created term box, enter a name for the new term. 
 
 8. 
 After each term is entered, a new term box appears. Continue to enter new term 
names into the term boxes until all terms are properly entered, then press Enter 
in the last empty term box to stop creating new terms.  
 
 9. 
 Subterms can be created under existing terms by doing the following:
 
 a. 
  Select the Create Term option from the existing term’s context menu (see 
Figure  8-16 ). 
 Figure 8-16.  Term context menu 
 
 b. 
 In the newly created term box, enter a name for the new term. 
 
 c. 
 After each term is entered, a new Term box appears. Continue to enter new 
term names into the Term boxes until all terms are properly entered, then 
press Enter in the last empty term box to stop creating new terms. 
 Managing Term Set  Properties 
 Once a new term set is created, you can configure its properties by clicking the name of the term set to show its 
properties screen. On this screen, which is broken down into four tabs, you can manage the following details:
• 
 On the General tab:
• 
 Term Set Name : Changes the term set’s name. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
347
• 
 Description : Optionally lets you enter a description of the term set.  
• 
 Owner : That is, the owner of the term set—set by default to the person who 
created the set. 
• 
 Contacts : Lets you specify an optional contact e-mail address for the term set.  
• 
 Stakeholders : Identifies people who are to be notified when changes are made 
to the term set. 
• 
 Submission Policy : Lets you configure the term set as closed or open. Closed 
term sets only have terms added by metadata managers. Open term sets can 
have terms added by term set users. 
• 
 On the Intended Use tab:
• 
 Available for Tagging: Identifies whether the term set can be used in lists and 
libraries for metadata assignment to list items and documents.  
• 
 Use this Term Set for Site Navigation: Identifies whether the term set can be 
used for site navigation. 
• 
 Use this Term Set fo r Faceted Navigation: Identifies whether the terms in the set 
can be used as reference details to support faceted navigation. 
• 
 On the Custom Sort tab:
• 
 Custom Sort Order: Identifies whether terms are to be sorted alphabetically or 
via a custom sort order using an available label.     
• 
 On the Custom Properties tab:
• 
 Products: Adds custom metadata properties and values to be associated with 
the term set. 
 In the term set’s context menu are other management options that can also be used to manage some of 
the set’s details. Options in the term set context menu (see Figure  8-15 ) include the following:
• 
 Create Term : Enables creation of terms to be contained in the term set (term creation 
is discussed earlier in this section). 
• 
 Copy Term Set : Lets you make a copy of the selected term set, including its properties 
and all of its contained terms. 
• 
 Reuse Terms : Allows selection of terms for reuse in other term sets. Reuse of a term 
set permits selection of other term sets where those terms are made available. Any 
changes to a reused term are reflected in all copies of that term across all term sets 
that use it. To view the locations where a term is used, select any instance of the term, 
and view the Member Of area on the General tab of the Term Properties page.  
• 
 Pin Term with Children : Permits selection of a term set to be pinned within another 
set. This allows reuse of the terms but also allows them to be managed by different 
security groups in other term sets. 
• 
 Move Term Set : Lets you move a selected term set under a different group within the 
term store.  
• 
 Delete Term Set : Deletes the selected term set. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
348
 Managing  Term Properties 
 Like term sets, terms have manageable properties. To manage the properties of a term, click the term 
within the Term Store Management Tool page, and the properties page for the selected term appears. Term 
properties that can be managed include the following:
• 
 On the General tab:
• 
 Available for Tagging: Identifies whether the term is available when assigning 
metadata to lists and libraries. 
• 
 Language: Identifies the language for the term’s labels.  
• 
 Description: Optionally lets you enter a description of the term. 
• 
 Default Label: Identifies the term’s default label, which is initially set to the term 
name entered when the term was created. 
• 
 Other Labels: Lists any additional labels for the term. 
• 
 Member  Of: Lists term sets that the term belongs to. 
• 
 On the Custom Properties tab:
• 
 Shared Properties: Identifies properties associated with the term that are to be 
available in all locations where the term is used. 
• 
 Local Properties: Identifies properties associated with the term that are to be 
available only when the term is used in the current term set. 
 As with term sets, in the context menu for listed terms, there is a set of options that allow management 
of the following details (see Figure  8-16 ):
• 
 Create Term : Provides the ability to create terms contained within the selected term 
(creating terms is discussed earlier in this section). 
• 
 Copy Term : Lets you make a copy of the selected term, including its properties and 
all its contained terms. 
• 
 Reuse Terms : Allows selection of terms for reuse in other term sets. Reuse of terms 
permits selection of other term sets where those terms can be used. Any changes to a 
reused term are reflected in all copies of that term across the term sets that use it. To 
view the locations where a term is used, select any instance of the term, and view the 
Member Of area on the General tab of the Term Properties page.  
• 
 Pin Term with Children : Permits selection of a term to be pinned with another term 
set. This allows reuse of the terms, but also allows them to be managed by different 
security groups. 
• 
 Merge Terms : Lets a selected term be merged into another. The properties of the 
destination term, including labels, are updated with the selected term’s details. 
• 
 Deprecate Term : Makes the term unselectable when the term set is in use. The term 
continues to exist and be available for reference if it was previously assigned to 
content, but it can no longer be assigned to other items.  
• 
 Move Term : Allows you to move a selected term under a different term set or term 
within a term set. 
• 
 Delete Term : Deletes the selected term. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ WORKING WITH SITE COLUMNS, CONTENT TYPES, AND TERM SETS
349
 You can add values to this field by typing in the text box itself. The field includes type-ahead 
functionality, which will list matching terms below the entered text to allow easy selection of the available 
terms. You can also add terms by clicking on the Term Selector icon and directly selecting the desired term 
from the presented term set hierarchy. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, we focused on site columns, content types, and term sets. We reviewed how site columns 
are created and managed. We detailed how site columns are used in content types and how content types 
are managed and associated with lists and libraries. Lastly, we discussed term sets, including how they are 
created, managed, and used for list and library columns. 
 Working with Terms as  Metadata 
 Once configured, term sets and terms can be used as values within Managed Metadata columns in lists 
and libraries. (Creating columns, including Managed Metadata columns, is discussed in Chapter   5 .) When 
configuring a Managed Metadata column, select an available term set to use as the source for the options in 
the column. When a Managed Metadata column is edited within a list item’s or document property’s details, 
it appears as a text field followed by a term selector (see Figure  8-17 ).

 CHAPTER 9  
 Workflows and Information 
Management Policies 
 To this point we have discussed the various resources available in SharePoint to store and manage 
information. You have seen how to manage media (such as standard documents, videos, and images), 
structured data (such as contact lists, tasks, and events), and web content (such as web pages). In this 
chapter, we focus our discussion on how processes can be introduced into the environment to enhance 
information, allowing it to be incorporated into associated business processes and to help automate 
information management. Also discussed is how information management policies can be introduced to 
control content as it matures and to audit changes to information. 
 Workflow Overview 
 One of SharePoint’s most significant capabilities is that it can be used to automate business processes 
through creation of workflow solutions.  Automate business processes when you want to do any of the 
following:
• 
 Reduce the length of time a process takes.  
• 
 Ensure consistency through iterations of a process.  
• 
 Reduce errors by ensuring information integrity and reducing manual work.  
• 
 Provide auditability and oversight of work efforts.    
 Workflows automate business processes by creating a series of interconnected actions organized to 
represent the business process. SharePoint 2016 includes two separate workflow platforms. One platform 
is the SharePoint 2010 workflow platform. The SharePoint 2010 workflow platform is available by default in 
SharePoint 2016, as it was in SharePoint 2013. 
 SharePoint 2016 also supports integration with Microsoft Workflow Manager. Workflow Manager is 
designed to be used across applications, including SharePoint. It is installed and configured separately from 
the standard SharePoint services and so must be specially set up in SharePoint environments. The Workflow 
Manager platform provides the following benefits over the SharePoint 2010 workflow platform:
• 
 Having workflows hosted outside SharePoint allows scaling of workflow services 
without impacting general SharePoint access and allows workflow services to 
support multiple applications.

 An integrated Visual Designer is available in SharePoint Designer for creating 
workflow processes through a Visio-like interface that can be used only when 
creating workflows against the Workflow Manager platform. 
• 
 Additional actions are included, such as looping, web service access, and task 
process management. 
 Workflow Lists 
 Before we discuss the different types of workflows and how to create them, we need to discuss the 
structure of the SharePoint resources that support workflows. Workflow data is managed in the site where 
the workflow is created, and a set of lists store information about the running instances of a workflow. 
A workflow instance is a single execution of the workflow process. You can have multiple instances of a 
workflow running at any given time in your site. However, only one instance at a time can run on a specific 
list item or document. For example, if you have an RFP Approval workflow that runs against your RFP 
Response Documents library, there can be instances of the workflow running against multiple RFP response 
documents in the library but for any single RFP response document, there can only be one instance of the 
workflow running. 
 Workflow Tasks List 
 A workflow tasks list is used to store and manage tasks assigned through workflows. These lists are located 
in the same site that contains the workflows they support. There can be more than one workflow tasks lists 
per site, and multiple workflows can save tasks to the same workflow tasks list. The list used by a workflow 
process is defined as part of the configuration of the workflow. A workflow tasks list’s structure varies 
depending on whether it is created to support SharePoint 2010 workflows or Workflow Manager workflows. 
A workflow tasks list created to support SharePoint 2010 workflow platform tasks contains the structure 
described in Table  9-1 .

 While workflow tasks lists are used by the workflow processes to store and manage tasks assigned 
through the workflow processes, they can also be used to provide  visibility into tasks requiring attention and 
can be rolled up into consolidated task views. These types of views provide visibility into workflow processes 
and activities. 
 
■ Note   Tasks associated with the SharePoint 2010 workflow platform processes and tasks associated 
with Workflow Manager workflows cannot exist in the same list since they use different workflow tasks list 
structures. When creating workflows, you cannot create Workflow Manager workflow tasks in a list created for 
SharePoint 2010 workflows, and vice versa. 
 Workflow  History List 
 The second type of list used to support workflow processes is the workflow history list. Like a workflow tasks 
list, a history list resides in the same site where the workflow executes, and there can be multiple instances 
of workflow history lists in the same site. These lists are used to track the activities occurring as part of the 
running workflow instances. The lists contain the running history of actions, outcomes, and comments that 
can be used to audit a workflow from inception through completion. Workflow history lists are the source for 
the workflow history details shown when you view workflow interface details, which are discussed later in 
this chapter. 
 Unlike workflow tasks lists, which are visible and directly accessible in sites, workflow history lists 
are hidden and directly accessible only by typing in the path to the list in the web browser. The path is in 
the format  http://<SiteURL>/Lists/<HistoryList> , where  SiteURL  is the full path to the site where the 
workflow resides and  HistoryList is the workflow history list’s name, as it was identified when the workflow 
was created. By default, this list is named  Workflow History .

 The workflow history list supports a workflow by acting as the log for all the actions that have occurred 
as part of the workflow. Unlike the workflow tasks list, workflow history lists have the same structure whether 
they are created to support SharePoint 2010 workflows or Workflow Manager workflows. These lists have the 
 structure detailed in Table  9-3 .

 While the information in the workflow history lists become available when workflow instance details 
are viewed, you can also use the lists for reporting sources; that is, to create audit reporting for a specific 
process’s instance. 
 Creating and Configuring Workflows 
 There are several approaches for creating workflows that provide different levels of workflow capability and 
require different levels of workflow creation skills. Approaches for creating workflows include the following:
• 
 Out of the Box : There are several reusable workflows available in SharePoint that can 
be used to create some basic workflow processes. Reusable workflows, configured 
directly through the web browser, can be created by anyone having Design 
permissions or higher in a list or library. The available out of the box workflows 
depend on the SharePoint features active within the site collection. (Out of the box 
reusable workflows are discussed later in this chapter.)  
• 
 SharePoint Designer : SharePoint Designer 2013 is a free downloadable tool that 
allows creation of comprehensive SharePoint 2010 foundation workflows and 
Workflow Manager workflows. SharePoint Designer includes a series of events, 
actions, conditions, and steps for defining workflow solution functionality. Like out 
of the box workflows, these workflows require Design permissions in order to be 
created. (SharePoint Designer workflows are discussed later in this chapter.) 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
356
• 
 Visual Studio : Visual Studio is used to create .NET workflows, which leverage the 
underlying workflow services directly and are created by SharePoint developers as 
compiled solutions. They must be deployed by a SharePoint technical administrator.    
 
■ Note   There are also several third-party solutions available to create workflows in SharePoint. These 
solutions provide a variety of levels of integration and often include a visual workflow design interface and an 
extended set of available actions to incorporate into workflow processes. 
 The methods and capabilities necessary to create workflows depend on the type of workflow you are 
creating. This section focuses on how to create and configure the available out of the box reusable workflows 
and how to create and configure workflows in SharePoint Designer. 
 Creating Out of the  Box Workflows 
 As mentioned earlier, some workflows available in SharePoint can be created directly through the web 
browser based on a set of reusable workflows. Which reusable workflows are available by default in 
SharePoint depends on the features enabled in the site collection. The following out of the box workflows are 
available by default in SharePoint 2016. 
 Three-State Workflow 
 The Three-State workflow lets you promote a list item or document through three phases. With the move to 
each stage defined in the workflow, the following  activities occur:
• 
 A defined task is assigned to an identified individual. 
• 
 The individual assigned the task is alerted to it via e-mail.  
• 
 The status of the item is moved to the next status once the defined task is marked 
complete. 
 This workflow is based on the SharePoint 2010 workflow foundation. To make this workflow available, 
you must have the Three-State Workflow site collection feature enabled in the site collection where you want 
to use it. 
 Once the Three-State Workflow site collection feature is enabled in your site collection, you can add the 
Three-State reusable workflow template to your lists and libraries. To create a new Three-State workflow, do 
the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to create the Three-State workflow.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Add a Workflow option from the 
Workflow Settings drop-down menu on the List or Library ribbon tab 
(see Figure  9-1 ). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
357
 
 3. 
 On the Add a Workflow  page (see Figure  9-2 ), do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Workflow section, select the Three-State option from the Select a 
Workflow Template list. 
 
 b. 
 In the Name section, enter a name for the workflow. This name cannot be 
the same as that for any other workflow created for the same list or library.  
 
 c. 
 In the Task List section, select the workflow task list where tasks generated 
by it are to be created. All SharePoint 2010 workflow foundation workflow 
tasks lists in the site are listed, along with a New Task List option. If selected, 
it creates a new workflow tasks list. 
 
 d. 
 In the History List section, select the workflow history list that is to be used 
to store workflow history details for workflow instances. All workflow history 
lists in the site are listed for selection, along with a Workflow History (New) 
option that can be selected to create a new workflow history list to store the 
workflow history. 
 
 e. 
   In the Start Options section, identify how to initiate the workflow for items in 
the list or library. Selectable options are these:
• 
 Allow this workflow to be manually started by an authenticated user 
with Edit Item permissions : Identifies whether to start the workflow 
manually. In configuring this option, specify whether users with Edit 
Item permissions can start the workflow or whether they must have 
Manage List Permissions, such as Designers, to start it.  
• 
 Creating a new item will start this workflow : Identifies whether the 
workflow starts automatically when an item is added to the list or 
library. 
 
 f. 
 Once all information is entered, click the Next button.

 4. 
 On the Customize the  Three-State Workflow page  , do the following:
 
 a. 
  In the Workflow States section, identify the field containing the status values 
the item will be promoted through. This must be a Choice field with at least 
three value options defined. Once this is selected, identify the three values 
the item is to be promoted through by identifying the Initial State value, 
Middle State value, and Final State value.  
 
 b. 
 In the Specify What You Want to Happen When a Workflow Is Initiated 
section, do the following:
 
 i. 
 In the Task Details section, identify information to include in the 
tasks created to support the movement from the first stage to the 
second stage. Include the following details:
 
 1. 
 Task Title : Identifies details to be placed in the task’s Title field. 
This information is created as a concatenation of entered text 
and an optional field value of the list item or document.  
 
 2. 
 Task Description : Identifies details to be included in the task’s 
Description field. This information includes entered text, an 
optional field value from the list item or document, and an 
optional link to the item.

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
359
 
 3. 
 Task Due Date : Identifies a date for the task’s Due Date field. This date 
is based on a date field in the item defaulted to the Created date.  
 
 4. 
 Task Assigned To : Identifies details for the task’s Assigned To value. 
This information can be based on any Person or Group field value 
associated with the list item or a specifically entered user. 
 
 ii.  In the E-mail Message Details section, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Identify whether an e-mail is to be sent to the individual assigned 
the task. Identify an e-mail address to send the message to and 
specify whether you want the e-mail sent to the assigned individual.  
 
 2. 
 Identify the subject for the message to be sent and whether to 
include the task title in the subject line. 
 
 3. 
 Identify details for the body of the e-mail message. Specify whether to 
include a link to the list item or document and what text to include.  
 
 c. 
 In the Specify What You Want to Happen When a Workflow Changes to Its 
Middle State section, do the following:
 
 i. 
 In the Task Details section, identify information to include in the tasks 
created to support the movement from the second stage to the third 
stage. Include the following details:
 
 1. 
 Task Title : Identifies details to place in the task’s Title field. This 
information is created as a concatenation of entered text and an 
optional field value of the list item or document. 
 
 2. 
 Task Description : Identifies details to include in the task’s 
Description field. This information includes entered text, an 
optional field value from the list item or document, and an optional 
link to the item. 
 
 3. 
 Task Due Date : Identifies the date for the task’s Due Date field based 
on a date field in the item defaulted to the Created date.  
 
 4. 
 Task Assigned To : Identifies details for the task’s Assigned To value. 
This information can be based on any Person or Group field value 
associated with the list item or a specifically entered user. The 
default option is the item’s Created By user value.  
 
 ii.  In the E-mail Message Details section, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Identify whether an e-mail should be sent to the individual responsible 
for the task. Identify an e-mail address to send the message to and 
specify whether you want it sent to the assigned individual.  
 
 2. 
 Identify the subject of the message to be sent and whether to 
include the task title in the message’s subject line.  
 
 3. 
 Identify the details in the body of the e-mail message. Specify 
whether to include a link to the list item or document and, if it is 
included, with what text. 
 
 5. 
 Once the information is entered, click the OK button.

whether to add the signatures one at a time (serially) or all at the same time 
(in parallel). If you want, add more stages by clicking the Add a New Stage 
option to assign additional signing tasks, also serially or in parallel.  
 
 b.

 The workflow is saved, and you are returned to the library view page. 
 Disposition Approval Workflow 
 The  Disposition Approval workflow is used to help manage retention and expiration of content and the 
approval processes tied to deciding whether to delete or keep content. The Disposition Approval workflow is 
typically used in conjunction with information management retention policies (discussed in a later section). 
Like other out of the box reusable workflows discussed so far, the Disposition Approval workflow is built on 
the SharePoint 2010 workflow foundation. This workflow is available in sites by activating the Disposition 
Approval Workflow site collection feature. To create and configure this workflow, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to create the workflow.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Add Workflow option from the 
Workflow Settings drop-down menu on the List or Library ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Add Workflow page (see Figure  9-2 ), do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Workflow section, select the Disposition Approval workflow template 
from the Select a Workflow Template list. 
 
 b. 
 In the Name section, enter a name for the workflow. It cannot be a name 
used for any other workflow created in the same list or library. 
 
 c. 
 In the Task List section, select the workflow task list where tasks generated 
by this workflow are to be created. All workflow tasks lists in the site will 
be of the same type, either SharePoint 2010 workflow or SharePoint 2013 
workflow. A New Task List option is also listed. If selected, it creates a new 
workflow tasks list. 
 
 d. 
 In the History List section, select the workflow history list in which to store 
workflow history details for the workflow instances. All of the site’s workflow 
history lists can be selected, along with a New History List option that, if 
selected, creates a new workflow history list.

 e. 
   In the Start Options section, identify how to initiate the workflow for items in 
the list or library. Selectable options are these:  
• 
 Allow this workflow to be manually started by an authenticated 
user with Edit permissions : Identifies whether to start the workflow 
manually. In configuring this option, specify whether users with Edit 
Item permissions can start the workflow or whether they must have 
Manage List Permissions, such as Designers, to start it.  
• 
 Creating a new item will start this workflow : Identifies whether to start 
the workflow automatically when an item is added to the list or library. 
• 
 Changing an item will start this workflow : Identifies whether to start the 
workflow automatically when an item in the list or library is altered.     
 
f. 
 Once all information is entered, click the OK button. 
 The Disposition workflow is created, and you are taken to the Workflow Settings page. 
 Creating  SharePoint Designer Workflows 
 When workflows you want to create in SharePoint go beyond what the out of the box workflows offer, 
SharePoint Designer 2013 is the solution. As mentioned earlier, SharePoint Designer is a freely downloadable 
tool that lets you create sophisticated workflow processes in SharePoint. You can create three types of 
workflows using SharePoint Designer: list and library workflows, site workflows, and reusable workflows. 
 Creating SharePoint Designer List and Library Workflows 
 The first workflow type that SharePoint Designer 2013 can create is the list and library workflow. This type 
is similar to an out of the box workflow in that it is configured directly in a list or library and executed in that 
list’s or library’s items. 
 SharePoint Designer workflows are comprised of a combination of  steps, conditions, and actions .
• 
 Steps : Steps are used to group and organize conditions and actions. They make it 
easier to understand and manage the workflow process. 
• 
 Conditions : Conditions are rules used to determine whether actions are run. 
• 
 Actions : Actions are activities to be performed in the workflow. 
 There are several approaches for  creating SharePoint Designer workflows in a library. To create a 
SharePoint Designer workflow in a list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to create the workflow.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Create a Workflow in SharePoint 
Designer option from the Workflow Settings drop-down menu on the List or 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 If prompted to confirm allowing the web site to open a program on the computer, 
click the Allow button. 
 
 4. 
 If prompted with a notification that a web site wants to open a program, click the 
Allow button. 
 
 5. 
 If prompted with a warning that some files may be harmful and asking whether 
you still want to open the file, click the Yes button.  

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
368
 
 6. 
 In the Create List Workflow window in SharePoint Designer (see Figure  9-6 ), 
enter the following information: 
 
 a. 
 Name of the workflow. 
 
 b. 
 An optional description for the workflow. 
 
 c. 
 Platform type identifying whether to create the workflow as a SharePoint 
2010 Workflow or a SharePoint 2013 Workflow. 
 
 d. 
 Click the OK button. 
 
■ Note   The SharePoint 2013 Workflow option is available when you create a workflow only if the Workflow 
Manager platform has been installed and configured for use by a SharePoint technical administrator in your 
SharePoint environment. 
 
 7. 
 On the Workflow screen in SharePoint Designer (see Figure  9-7 ), build the 
workflow logic by adding necessary actions, conditions, and steps. On 
the Workflow screen, save the workflow by choosing the Save option 
from the Workflow ribbon tab. Saving the workflow does not make it available 
to be run; it only saves any work completed to date.       
 Figure 9-6.  SharePoint Designer  Create List Workflow window 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
369
 
 8. 
 Once the workflow is configured, select the Check for Errors option from 
the Workflow ribbon tab. This option verifies that there are no syntax or 
configuration errors in the workflow structure. If there are errors, they are 
identified. If there are no errors, a message indicating that the workflow contains 
no syntax errors appears. 
 
 9. 
 Once the workflow has no errors, you can publish it by selecting the Publish 
option from the Workflow ribbon tab. The workflow is published and available to 
be run in the list or library. 
 The created workflow is published for use in SharePoint. We discuss running workflows later in this 
chapter. 
 Creating SharePoint Designer  Site Workflows 
 Our discussion so far has concerned creating workflows in lists and libraries. You can also create workflows 
in sites; for example, when the process you want to run is not directly linked to any one item in a list or 
library but instead will act on multiple items in a single list or library or across multiple lists and libraries. 
Say that you have a human resources workflow that calculates employee time-off carryover days. You may 
want to make it a site workflow, since it does not relate to any one item in the list. Instead it needs to access 
all items in a list of employee time-off details. 
 Figure 9-7.  SharePoint Designer  site screen 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
370
 No out of the box site workflows of this sort are available in SharePoint. You would create them using 
SharePoint Designer by doing as follows:
 
 1. 
 Open SharePoint Designer. 
 
 2. 
 Open your site in SharePoint Designer by selecting the Open Site option in the 
Open SharePoint Site section. 
 
 3. 
 On the SharePoint Designer site screen, click the Site Workflow option from the 
Site ribbon tab. 
 
 4. 
 In the Create Site Workflow window, enter the following:
 
 a. 
 A name for the new site workflow. 
 
 b. 
 An optional description for the workflow.  
 
 c. 
 The workflow’s platform type: SharePoint 2013 Workflow or SharePoint 2010 
workflow. As mentioned previously, the SharePoint 2013 Workflow option 
is available only if Workflow Manager is installed and configured for use in 
your SharePoint environment. 
 
 d. 
 Click the OK button. 
 
 5. 
 On the Workflow screen in SharePoint Designer (see Figure  9-7 ), build the 
workflow logic by adding necessary actions, conditions, and steps. On 
the Workflow screen, save the workflow by choosing the Save option from the 
workflow ribbon tab. Saving the workflow does not make it available to be run; 
it only saves work completed to date. 
 
 6. 
 Once the workflow is configured, select the Check for Errors option from 
the Workflow ribbon tab. This option verifies that there are no syntax or 
configuration errors in the workflow structure. If there are errors, they are 
identified. If there are no errors, a message identifying that the workflow contains 
no syntax errors appears. 
 
 7. 
 Once the workflow has no errors, you can publish it by selecting the Publish 
option from the Workflow ribbon tab. The workflow is published and available to 
be run in the site. 
 The created workflow is published for use in SharePoint. We discuss running workflows later in this 
chapter. 
 Creating  Reusable Workflows 
 Along with list and library and site workflows, you can also create reusable workflows in SharePoint. 
Reusable workflows are workflow definitions, or templates, that are created so that site users can associate 
them with their lists or libraries, just as they might pick out of the box workflows. How broadly a reusable 
workflow can be used in your environment depends on how generic you make the logic when you create the 
workflow. For example, if your workflow references a specific column, only lists and libraries containing that 
column will work with the reusable workflow. 
 To create a reusable workflow, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Open SharePoint Designer. 
 
 2. 
 Open your site in SharePoint Designer by selecting the Open Site option in the 
Open SharePoint Site section. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
371
 
 3. 
 On the SharePoint Designer site screen (see Figure  9-8 ), click the Reusable 
Workflow option from the Site ribbon tab.   
 Figure 9-8.  SharePoint Designer site  screen 
 
 4. 
 On the Create Reusable Workflow screen, enter the following:
 
 a. 
  A name for the new reusable workflow. This name will appear on the Add 
Workflow Screen. 
 
 b. 
 An optional description for the workflow. 
 
 c. 
 The content type the workflow is to be limited to. If you are not limiting the 
scope of the workflow, select the All option 
 
 d. 
 The workflow’s platform type: SharePoint 2013 Workflow or SharePoint 2010 
workflow. As mentioned previously, the SharePoint 2013 Workflow option 
is available only if Workflow Manager is installed and configured for use in 
your SharePoint environment. 
 
 e. 
 Click the OK button. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
372
 
 5. 
 On the Workflow screen in SharePoint Designer (see Figure  9-7 ), build the 
workflow logic by adding necessary actions, conditions, and steps. On the 
Workflow screen, save the workflow by selecting the Save option from the 
workflow ribbon tab. Saving the workflow does not make it available to be run; it 
only saves work completed to date. 
 
 6. 
 Once the workflow is configured, select the Check for Errors option from 
the Workflow ribbon tab. This option verifies that there are no syntax or 
configuration errors in the workflow structure. If there are errors, they are 
identified. If there are no errors a message identifying that the workflow contains 
no syntax errors appears. 
 
 7. 
 Once the workflow has no errors, you can publish it by selecting the Publish 
option from the Workflow ribbon tab. The workflow is published and available in 
the site’s Add a Workflow area.  
 The reusable workflow is created and can be selected from the Add a Workflow screen when new 
workflows are added to lists and libraries. A workflow limited to a specific content type will be available for 
creation only in locations where that content type is in use.  
 SharePoint Designer Workflow Activities 
 When you create workflows in SharePoint Designer, there are a variety of options available to build 
workflows. The available workflow steps, conditions, and actions vary depending on the type of workflow 
(SharePoint 2010 workflow or Workflow Manager workflow) you are creating. Table  9-4 shows the actions

 Various other capabilities can be leveraged in SharePoint Designer when you create workflows: using 
variables, creating parallel actions, using form parameters, and others. More information on these and other 
SharePoint Designer workflow development capabilities can be found on Microsoft’s web sites.       
 Using  Visual Designer when Creating Workflows 
 Visual Designer is a visual workflow creation feature in SharePoint Designer 2013 for creating a new 
workflow that will leverage the Workflow Manager platform. To access this view, select the Visual Designer 
option from the views drop-down menu to represent the workflow process in a Visio-like design palette, as 
Figure  9-9 shows. 
 Figure 9-9.  Visual Designer 
 In this view you can select actions, conditions, containers, and terminators from the shapes section and 
drag them on to the palette. You add items to the palette in the order they should be executed in. Once an 
action is on the palette, configure it by hovering over it and selecting properties from the action’s drop-down 
menu (see Figure  9-10 ). 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
378
 
■ Note   Visual Designer can only be used when Microsoft Visio 2013 is also installed on the machine you are 
using to create the workflow in SharePoint Designer. 
 Managing Workflows 
 When workflows are available in lists and libraries in SharePoint, you can view and manage the workflow 
instances on the list’s or library’s Workflow Settings page. To  access this page, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the workflows.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Workflow Settings option from the 
Workflow Settings drop-down menu on the List or Library ribbon tab.     
 The Workflow Settings page (see Figure  9-11 ) appears. From this page you can:
• 
 View the list of workflows associated with the current list or library. 
• 
 View the workflows associated with content types available in the current list or 
library. 
• 
 For all available workflows, see how many running workflow instances are active.  
• 
 Add a new workflow from an available workflow template.  
• 
 Remove an existing workflow. 
• 
 Disallow new running instances of an existing workflow. 
 Figure 9-10.  Visual Designer action drop-down  menu 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
379
 Viewing Available Workflows 
 From a list or library Workflow Settings page, you can view all available workflows configured in the list or 
library or for content types used in the list or library. By default, when this page is accessed, it displays the 
workflows created in the current list or library and shows the number of running instances of each (see 
Figure  9-11 ). If you have Workflow Manager configured in your environment, the workflows are grouped by 
type. 
 As discussed earlier, a running instance of a workflow identifies an executing copy of the workflow in 
progress against one of the items in the list or library. This concept is important to understand if you are 
planning to update or remove a listed workflow. 
 To view workflows associated with a content type used in the list or library, selecting the content type 
from the Show Workflow Associations of This Type drop-down list on the Workflow Settings page refreshes 
the page and shows the workflows associated with the selected content type. 
 To view available site workflows, navigate to the Site Workflow page by clicking the Site Workflow link 
from the Site Contents page. This will list all site workflows and allow selection of a workflow to run. 
 Editing General Workflow Details 
 Workflows created for a list or library can be edited from its Workflow Settings page. This is done by clicking 
on the name of the workflow to be edited. Doing this brings you to the Change a Workflow page, where you 
can update all of the general workflow details, including the following:
• 
 The name of the workflow. 
• 
 The workflow tasks list where the workflow’s generated tasks are stored. 
• 
 The workflow history list, where the workflow activity logging is done. 
• 
 The start options for the workflow, where you can identify whether it is to start 
manually, when new items are created in the list or library, or when items are 
changed in the list or library.  
 Figure 9-11.  Workflow Settings page 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
380
 Out of the box and SharePoint Designer list and library workflows can have their general details and 
settings edited in this way. However, after editing an out of the box workflow’s general settings, you see the 
workflow process details that define the workflow. You can then make necessary changes to these details to 
change the logic of the workflow. 
 Blocking Workflows 
 When a workflow is in a list or library or associated with one of a list’s or library’s available content types, you 
can configure it so new instances of it cannot be started. This configuration allows any workflow instances 
already in progress to run through completion. You might want to do this when phasing out an old workflow 
process in favor of a new one. To block a workflow from having new instances created, do the following:
 
 1. 
 On the Workflow Settings page for the associated list or library, select the 
Remove, Block, or Restore a Workflow option. 
 
 2. 
 On the Remove Workflow page, select the No New Instances option for the 
workflow to block. Then click the OK button. 
 New instances of the workflow are restricted from starting, and you are returned to the Workflow 
Settings page.  
 Deleting Workflows 
 A workflow that is no longer relevant should no longer be available. To remove it from a list or library and 
delete its definition and all its running instances, do the following:
 
 1. 
 On the Workflow Settings page for the list or library containing the workflow, 
click the Remove, Block, or Restore a Workflow link.  
 
 2. 
 On the Remove Workflows page, select the Remove option for the workflow you 
want to delete, and click the OK button. 
 The workflow is removed from the list or library, and you are returned to the Workflow Settings page. 
 Editing Workflows 
 The business logic for workflows created from out of the box workflow templates and from SharePoint 
Designer can be edited after their creation to ensure they properly support their associated business 
processes over time. 
 Editing Out of the Box Workflows 
 To edit the workflow process for workflows created from out of the box reusable workflows, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the workflow to edit.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Workflow Settings option from the 
Workflow Settings drop-down menu on the List or Library ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Workflow Settings page, click the name of the workflow to edit.

 On the second Change a Workflow page, make any further needed changes to the 
workflow details, and then click the Save button.     
 The workflow is updated based on the changes made.  
 Editing SharePoint Designer Workflows 
 SharePoint Designer list, library and reusable workflows are all editable in SharePoint Designer. Edit them as 
follows:
 
 1. 
 Open SharePoint Designer. 
 
 2. 
 Open your site in SharePoint Designer by selecting the Open Site option in the 
Open SharePoint Site section. 
 
 3. 
 On the SharePoint Designer Site screen, select Workflows from the Site Objects 
section of the page. 
 
 4. 
 On the Workflows screen, click the name of the workflow to edit. 
 
 5. 
 On the selected workflow’s detail screen, click the Edit Workflow link in the 
Customization section. 
 
 6. 
 On the workflow’s edit screen, make any needed changes to the workflow details. 
Saving your changes saves updates made to the workflow but does not make 
these updates available to be run until they are published. 
 
 7. 
 Once the workflow is configured, select the Check for Errors option from the 
Workflow ribbon tab. This option verifies there are no syntax or configuration 
errors in the workflow structure. If there are errors, they are identified. If there 
are no errors, a message indicating that the workflow contains no syntax errors 
appears. 
 
 8. 
 Once the workflow has no errors, you can publish it by selecting the Publish 
option from the Workflow ribbon tab. The workflow is published and available to 
be run in the site. 
 The updated workflow is published. These changes will be included as part of any new instances of the 
workflow started. Workflow instances already running will not be impacted by the changes made.    
 Running Workflows 
 After you create workflows in your SharePoint environment, you can run them. An instance of a list or library 
workflow runs against a specific list item or document in the list or library. An instance of a site workflow 
runs in the associated site but not against a specific list or library item. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
382
 Running  List and Library Workflows 
 Workflows configured in a list or library or a content type associated with a list or library start based on 
configured start options configured within the workflow. Workflows configured for manual start can be 
started by users having at least Edit permissions to the list item or document the workflow is to run against. 
To start a workflow configured to be started manually, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the workflow.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the item to run the workflow against, and 
select the Workflows option from the Items/Files ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Workflows page, select the workflow to start from the Start a New 
Workflow section. 
 
 4. 
 If the workflow requires input on start, you are prompted to enter any required 
information before clicking the Start button. 
 The workflow is started against the selected item, and you are returned to the list or library view page. 
 A second approach is to start a workflow against items in a list or library through the item’s hover menu. 
Do so as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the workflow.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, open the hover panel for the list item or 
document against which you want to start the workflow. Then select the 
Workflows option from the Advanced submenu (see Figure  9-12 ). 
 Figure 9-12.  Item hover  menu 
 
 3. 
 On the Workflows page, select the workflow to start from the Start a New 
Workflow section. 
 
 4. 
 If the workflow requires input on start, you are prompted to enter any required 
information before clicking the Start button. 
 The workflow is started against the selected item, and you are returned to the list or library view page. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
383
 
■ Note   Multiple instances of the same workflow cannot run on a single item at the same time. If a specific 
workflow is already running, you will not be able to start another instance of it against the same item. However, 
an item can have more than one different workflow running at once. 
 Workflows configured to start when new items are created in a list or library or when items are edited 
start automatically when the associated start condition is met.  
 Running  Site Workflows 
 When your site contains site workflows, run them by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site containing the site workflow to be run.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Contents option from the Quick Launch 
area or from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Contents page, select the Site Workflows options. 
 
 4. 
 On the Workflows page, select the workflow to run. 
 
 5. 
 If the workflow requires input on start, you are prompted to enter any required 
information before clicking the Start button.     
 The workflow is started in the site. 
 Working with Workflow Instances 
 As previously discussed, a workflow instance is a distinct execution against a selected item of the workflow 
process. You can view and manage these running and completed instances of workflows in the SharePoint 
environment You can also view their status and execution history, as well as run workflow actions and 
terminate executing instances. 
 Viewing Workflow Instance Status and  History 
 When a workflow instance is running and after it is completed, you can view the detailed activities that 
occurred during the instance. This information is available in the Workflow status page (see Figure  9-13 ). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
384
 The Workflow status page lists current and completed workflow instances for a selected list item or 
document. To access the Workflow status page, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the item whose workflow history you 
want to review. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the desired item and then click the 
Workflows option from the Items/Files ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Workflows page, select the running or completed workflow instance 
whose details you want to view. 
 The Workflow status page for the associated workflow instance appears. You can also navigate to the 
Workflow status page, where the workflow status column shows the most recent execution of a workflow 
against an item. When workflows are added to a list or library, a column is added to it that lists the status 
of the most recent execution of the workflow against the item. This status is shown as a hyperlink. When 
clicked, you are taken to the Workflow status page that lists all details associated with that workflow instance. 
If an item against which the workflow has not yet been run in the list or library, the status details for that item 
are blank.  
 
■ Note   To get to a workflow instance via the workflow column, include the column in the displayed list or 
library view. This column is added automatically to the list’s or library’s default view the first time a workflow is 
run. Add it manually to other list or library views as needed. 
 Figure 9-13.  Workflow status page 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
385
 On the Workflow status page, you can view the entire logged history for a given workflow instance and 
view all actions and completed tasks associated with that instance. Select the listed workflow tasks to view 
their details. This page also lists general workflow instance information, including the following:
• 
 The initiator of the workflow instance. 
• 
 When the workflow instance was started. 
• 
 The time of the instance’s last activity. 
• 
 A link to the item with which the workflow instance is associated. 
• 
 The internal status of the workflow instance.     
 Terminating Workflow  Instances 
 A workflow process runs until all of its activities are completed. At this point the workflow instance is 
complete. At times you might want to abort a workflow’s run and end it at the current point in its execution, 
prior to completion of all its identified activities. You can do this in the Workflow status screen. 
 When you are viewing the details for a running workflow instance, a link, called End This Workflow, 
appears at the bottom of the Workflow information section. When you click the link, you are prompted 
to confirm that you want to terminate the workflow instance. Clicking the OK button on the confirmation 
message ends the running workflow instance and returns you to the Workflow status page. There the 
workflow instance is updated to reflect its termination. In the completed workflows section of the page, its 
status is marked Cancelled. 
 Information Management Policies 
 Information management policies are rules you create to enforce compliance requirements for SharePoint 
sites and their content. Information management policies help you enforce content retention, management, 
audit, and disposition requirements. They can be configured at multiple levels in the environment, 
 including :
• 
 Site Collection : Policies defined at the site collection level apply in all sites 
throughout the collection. 
• 
 Content Type : Policies defined at the content type level apply to the content type 
wherever in the environment it is used. 
• 
 List or Library Content Type : Policies defined at this level impact items of a specific 
content type in a specified list or library. 
• 
 List or Library : Policies defined at the List or Library level apply to all items in the 
identified list or library.  
 Policy Types 
 Several types of information management policies can be configured in the environment. The policies that 
can be configured include the following: 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
386
 Retention 
 Retention policies allow you to define automated content locking and disposal rules. These policies are 
created to do the following:
• 
 Ensure the integrity and retention of content based on defined rules. 
• 
 Facilitate the removal of content based on defined time frames. 
• 
 Enforce the deletion of materials based on defined rules. 
 Retention rules are defined as multistage processes where in each stage you determine the following, as 
shown Figure  9-14 .
• 
 Event : The event that triggers the stage. The event is based on date details or a 
custom retention formula. 
• 
 Action : The activity to be performed when the event occurs. Options include:
• 
 Move to Recycle Bin : The item is deleted from the list or library, much as items 
are deleted manually. They are then subject to the recycle bin management 
rules. 
• 
 Permanently Delete : The item is deleted from the list or library. It is not placed 
in the recycle bin and so is unavailable for restoration.  
• 
 Transfer to Another Location : The item is moved to a registered destination 
location in SharePoint. The location must be configured as a registered 
destination for it to be available for selection. (Creating registered locations is 
discussed in Chapter   10 .) 
• 
 Start a Workflow : An identified workflow is started against the item when the 
event occurs. 
• 
 Skip to Next Stage : The information management policy transitions to the next 
defined stage. The associated item is not changed in any way. 
• 
 Declare Record : The item is locked as a record. This option requires enabling of 
the In Place Records Management site collection feature in the site collection.  
• 
 Delete Previous Drafts : Any previous draft versions stored in its version history 
are deleted. Only published versions remain.  
• 
 Delete All Previous Versions : All previous versions of the item stored in its 
version history are deleted. Only the current version remains.  
• 
 Recurrence : Identifies whether the stage actions are to be repeated while the item is 
in the stage. If the actions are to be run repeatedly, define how frequently. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
387
 Define as many stages as needed to support item retention and removal in SharePoint lists and libraries. 
Configuring retention policies is discussed later in this chapter. 
 Auditing 
 Auditing policies identify activities that you want to track against list or library items. Auditing settings can 
be configured globally in a site collection or as part of an information management policy to impact only 
those items in a specific site, list, or library. When configuring auditing settings as part of an information 
management policy, you can specify to audit the following options (see Figure  9-15 ).
• 
 Opening or downloading documents, viewing items in lists, or viewing item 
properties. 
• 
 Editing items. 
 Figure 9-14.  Retention rules management 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
388
• 
 Checking out or checking in items. 
• 
 Moving or copying items to another location in the site. 
• 
 Deleting or restoring items.  
  Figure 9-15.  Auditing rules management 
 Barcodes 
 When barcoding is configured as part of an information management policy, a barcode is assigned to 
each item. It can track physical, paper-based, copies of the information in relation to their electronic 
counterparts. When configuring this option, you can also specify whether to prompt users to insert barcodes 
into Microsoft Office documents prior to saving or printing the files.  
 Labels 
 Labels let you add watermarks to Microsoft Office documents. When you enable labels, you can configure 
the following elements (see Figure  9-16 ):
• 
 Prompt users to insert a label before saving or printing : Prompts the user accessing 
the document in Microsoft Office to insert the label before the document is saved or 
printed. 
• 
 Prevent changes to labels after they are added : Locks the label from editing after it is 
created. 
• 
 Label format : Defines the format and content of the label’s details. 
• 
 Appearance : Identifies the font type, size, style, and placement details.       
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ WORKFLOWS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES
389
 Site Collection Policies 
 Site collection policies are the broadest policy types configurable in SharePoint. When created, they apply to 
all content in all sites of the site collection. Create a site collection policy when you want to enforce a policy 
throughout your environment. For example, you can create a site collection policy when you want to audit 
all security changes made across the site collection. To create site collection policies, which can only be 
created and managed by by Site Collection Administrators, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in your site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the site collection home page, select the Site Settings option from the 
Settings menu. 
 Figure 9-16.  Labels rules  management

to only store a specific number of days’ worth of audit details and, if you 
do, whether to copy the current audit report to another location before it is 
trimmed. 
 
 b. 
 In the Documents and Items section, identify the document and list item 
activities to be audited. Specify any combination of the following options:
 
 i. 
 Opening or downloading documents, viewing items in lists, or viewing 
item properties : Identifies that any document or item view will be 
audited. 
 
 ii.  Editing Items : Auditing all modifications to existing content or additions 
of new content.  
 
 iii.  Checking Out or Checking In Items : Auditing item check-in and check-out 
actions.  
 
 iv.  Moving or Copying Items to Another Location in the Site : Tracking item 
copy or move activities performed through the SharePoint Send To 
capabilities. 
 
 v. 
 Deleting or Restoring Items : Auditing deletion of items and restoration of 
items from the recycle bin. 
 
 c. 
 In the Lists, Libraries, and Sites section, identify the site, list, and library 
level activities to be audited. Specify any combination of the following 
options:
 
 i. 
 Editing Content Types and Columns : Audits changes to content types 
associated with lists and libraries, as well as changes to columns in 
content types, lists, and libraries. 
 
 ii.  Searching Site Content : Audits searches performed in the environment. 
 
 iii.  Editing Users and Permissions : Audits changes made to the permissions 
of sites, lists, libraries, or items, including inheritance settings changes. 
 
 d. 
 Click the OK button. 
 The site collection auditing options are saved, and the identified activities will be tracked and logged.  
 Content Type Policies 
 Content type policies are information management policies defined against content types. These policies 
are enforced everywhere those content types are in use. To create and manage site content types, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the content type was created. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.

administrative description of the policy. 
 
 b. 
 In the Policy Statement section, enter the policy statement—that is, the 
description users see when they open an item subject to the policy. 
 
 c. 
 In the Retention section, identify whether the policy is to contain retention 
rules. If it is, define the retention stages. (Retention policy options are 
discussed in this chapter’s Retention section.) 
 
 d. 
  In the Auditing section, identify whether the policy includes any auditing 
requirements. If it does, specify the activities to audit. (Trackable auditing 
activities are discussed in the “Auditing” section.) 
 
 e. 
 In the Barcodes section, specify whether the policy includes barcoding 
requirements and whether to prompt the user to insert a barcode before 
saving or printing a Microsoft Office document. 
 
 f. 
 In the Labels section, identify whether the policy includes document 
labeling requirements. Then select label configuration and display settings 
(these options are discussed in the “Labels” section). 
 
 g. 
 Once the information for the policy is entered, click the OK button to save 
the information management policy. 
 The information management policy is saved, and you are returned to the Content Type page. Once 
the policy is configured, you can edit it by returning to the Edit Policy page and making any necessary 
alterations. 
 List and Library Content Type Policies 
 If you want to configure a policy for a content type but only when that content type is used in a specific list 
or library, you can create a list or library content type policy that is enforced only for items of the identified

labeling requirements. Then select label configuration and display settings 
(these options are discussed in the “Labels” section). 
 
 g. 
 Once the information for the policy is entered, click the OK button to save 
the information management policy. 
 The policy is saved, and you are returned to the Information Management Policy Settings page. To 
modify an existing list or library content type policy, return to the Edit Policy page and make any needed 
adjustments. 
 List and Library Policies 
 At times you might want to create a policy enforced on all items in a specific list or library regardless of 
content type. To do so, create a list or library policy. These policies support only retention, not audit, 
barcode, or label policies. To create this type of policy, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to create the policy.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab.

the item. To access this window, select the Compliance Details option from the document’s, list item’s, or 
folder’s hover panel’s Advanced submenu. 
 The compliance details window contains the following information:
• 
 The Retention Stages section lists the retention details that the item has been 
processed through. 
• 
 Details for the item are listed, including Name, Content Type, Folder Path Exemption 
Status, Hold Status, and Record Status. 
• 
 The Audit Log section has a General Audit Log Report option that takes you to 
the View Audit Reports page, where you can run a variety of reports to view audit, 
activity, and security details. (Reporting is discussed in detail in Chapter   13 .) 
 Policy  Exemptions 
 While policies are defined in content types or lists and libraries, you can use the compliance details window

 Summary 
 In this chapter, we focused our discussion on workflows and information management policies. For 
workflows, we reviewed the various types that can be created and discussed how to create, manage, and run 
them. We then shifted our discussion to information management policies and reviewed the different types 
of policies that can be created and discussed how they are created and managed. 
 In the next chapter, we will discuss record management and detail all of the capabilities offered by 
SharePoint 2016 to create, retain, and manage site content as records.

 CHAPTER 10  
 Records Management 
 A record is a type of information, typically a document, that requires structured retention and management 
to support either internally defined or externally mandated  regulatory requirements  . Records management 
encompasses the  process and resources to properly handle the declaration, undeclaration, and removed 
of materials at the appropriate points in their lifecycles. Records management in  SharePoint is used for the 
following:
• 
 Uploading materials to be stored and tracked as records. 
• 
 Identifying when items managed through the environment are to be classified and 
managed as records. 
• 
 Determining how long records are to be maintained. 
• 
 Archiving and disposing of materials based on defined disposition rules. 
 Several capabilities are available in SharePoint to manage these aspects of records management. 
Records management  capabilities in SharePoint include the following:
• 
 Content organizer, which is used to collect and organize materials. 
• 
 Record retention rules, which define declaration, undeclaration, and removal rules 
for materials. 
• 
 Record centers, which store and organize records. 
• 
 Holds created to identify items that need to be retained or exported based on the 
outcome of external events (typically litigation). 
• 
 Document deletion policies created to delete materials based on organizational 
content disposal requirements. 
• 
 Data loss prevention (DLP) policies used to help protect sensitive organizational 
content. 
 Understanding Records Management 
 Before the technical tools in SharePoint that support record retention and management are discussed, you 
need to become familiar with the elements of records management and with the planning to be done to 
prepare for managing records within your SharePoint environment, including how to manage materials 
identified by the organization for proactive control, planning for reacting to content retention, or hold, needs 
to address situational information retention requirements, especially litigation or audit events, and finally 
for managing the expiration of content. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
398
 Proactive Records Management Planning 
 Before you can take advantage of the SharePoint records management features, you need to define your 
requirements for managing records, including how these features are to be applied to the content managed 
in SharePoint. This planning should include the following:
• 
 Identifying finalized materials to be uploaded to SharePoint for retention and access 
purposes. 
• 
 Identifying materials to be developed in SharePoint and matured as records. 
• 
 Defining records retention rights. 
• 
 Determining retention rules records are to adhere to.  
• 
 Defining content consumption approaches for the material.  
• 
 Defining content archival and expiration rules and approaches. 
 Identify Records 
 The first step in records management planning is identifying materials in the environment that are to be 
managed as records. To determine the materials to be managed (such as contracts, standard operating 
procedures, product specifications, and so on) and decide whether these materials are to be developed in 
the environment or added to it after they are created and are ready for maintenance as records. For each 
type of item, define the following:
• 
 The method to be used to bring the content into the environment. This will be some 
combination of the following:
• 
 Uploading the materials in their completed state to store them for retention and 
consumption. 
• 
 Uploading materials that are to be further developed in the environment and 
retained as records later in their lifecycle. 
• 
 Creating new materials and managing their entire lifecycle in the SharePoint 
environment, including eventual retention as records. 
• 
 The details about the items to be tracked. They should include a combination of 
fields to manage records retention, as well as fields to support targeted searching and 
content organization requirements. For example, a field needed to manage retention 
might include an effective date for a contract if retention rules leverage that date to 
determine when the document should be declared as a record. 
• 
 Security of items at each point in the lifecycle. As materials mature, security may 
need to be updated to reflect changes to their access. For example, when a proposal 
document is being developed, sales representatives might have rights to edit it. But 
once finalized and distributed, it might become read-only for them to protect it from 
alteration after distribution. 
• 
 How content is consumed by site users, including organization for browsing and 
viewing and availability through search. Just as document security may change over 
time, how documents are exposed to the organization may also change. For example, 
a contract in development might be seen only by navigating to the library where 
it exists. But when finalized and executed, the contract might join other executed 
agreements in being viewable and searchable. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
399
• 
 Plan for the archival and deletion of content. Determines content that should be 
moved to an archive location at some point in its lifecycle and determine content 
that should be subject to standard content deletion plans.    
 With this information identified, you can determine the record  management      capabilities required to 
support the organization’s records management needs. 
 Planning for Content Holds 
 Unlike records retention processes, which are proactively configured and managed,  content holds   occur as 
reactions to events, such as litigation events, that require identification and retention of materials related to 
a specific topic or activity. Since information retention needs cannot be predetermined, this is a reactionary 
process, one based on each situation’s specific needs. Pre-hold planning can help streamline information 
discovery and optimize content to make locating it easier based on details most likely to relate to content 
hold needs. Taking the following planning steps will help you prepare for content holds:
• 
 Identify the most likely scenarios for which content holds will be needed. 
• 
 Specify content attributes that represent the details most likely to be used to identify 
materials needed to support expected hold scenarios. If, for example, you expect 
to need content holds for product materials, ensure that items associated with a 
specific product are easy to identify by tracking the product or products an item 
relates to as part of its properties. 
 Adding Content with Content Organizer 
 Adding documents to SharePoint libraries, including methods that support uploading single items and multiple 
items all at once into an environment, is discussed in Chapter   7  . One characteristic of all the methods is that the 
individual doing the upload has to know where the document must be placed to become available. But at times 
you will not want to rely on users in the environment to place items in appropriate locations or want items placed 
in their final store until a specific person or group in the organization reviews them. You might want the records 
management department, for example, to review a contract before the rest of the organization sees it. 
 Content organizer  is used to allow materials to be uploaded into a single library, called a Drop Off 
library. These materials are then automatically routed to a final storage location based on the item’s 
properties when uploaded. Content organizer is an alternative to constructing workflow processes when 
you want to control routing of documents added to SharePoint. It lets you manage duplicate document 
uploading and simple document review requirements prior to materials being made generally available. 
 Enabling Content Organizer 
 Content organizer must be enabled in a site before it can be used. Record center sites (discussed later in 
the chapter) have this feature activated by default. However, all other sites require it be  enabled . To enable 
content organizer in a site, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to enable content organizer. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, click the Manage Site Features option from the Site 
Actions section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Features page, click the Activate button for the Content Organizer 
feature. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
400
 With the content organizer feature activated, a Drop Off library is created, and content organizer 
management capabilities are added. 
 Configuring Content Organizer 
 Once content organizer features are active in a site, you can configure its services to identify how content 
added to the site is handled. To configure content organizer in a site where the feature is enabled, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where content organizer is enabled. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings Menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Content Organizer Settings option from the 
Site Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Content Organizer Settings page (see Figure  10-1 ), do as follows: 
 
 a. 
 In the Redirect Users to the Drop Off Library section, identify whether to 
redirect users of libraries listed as content organizer destinations to the 
Drop Off library when they upload content. 
 
 b. 
  In the Sending to Another Site section, identify whether content organizer 
rules can route documents to libraries in a different site. 
 
 c. 
 In the Folder Partitioning section, identify whether to create new folders 
to route content to once the folder currently in use contains a specified 
number of files. As part of configuring this option, also specify the number 
of items to allow before routing to a new folder and the format to use for 
naming new folders that are created. 
 
 d. 
  In the Duplicate Submissions section, identify the approach for handling 
an uploaded file with the same name as an existing item in the destination 
location. You can choose to upload the file as a new version of the existing 
file or to append unique characters to the uploaded file’s name to store it as 
a new item in the library. 
 
 e. 
 In the Preserving Context section, identify whether audit log and property 
details are to be kept with the document as it is routed to its identified final 
storage location. 
 
 f. 
  In the Rule Manager section, specify who can create content organizer rules 
and whether such individuals are to get e-mail notifications when items 
submitted do not meet defined rules or when content is left in the Drop Off 
library for a designated number of days. 
 
 g. 
 Click the OK button to save the content organizer  configuration . 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
401
 The overall configuration of the  content organizer is saved, and content organizer is ready to have 
content organizer rules configured. 
 Configuring Content Organizer Rules 
 Content organizer  rules govern movement of content from the site’s Drop Off library to other locations in the 
current site or in another SharePoint site. To create content organizer rules in a site, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where content organizer rules need to be configured.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Content Organizer Rules option from the Site 
Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Content Organizer Rules page, click the New Item option to create a new 
content organizer rule. 
 
 5. 
 On the New Rule page (see Figure  10-2 ), do the following: 
 
 a. 
 In the Rule Name section, enter the name for the new content organizer rule.  
 
 b. 
 In the Rule Status and Priority section, identify whether the rule is active and, if 
active, the rule’s priority level. Inactive rules are not used to route content. The 
priority determines the importance of the rule. If more than one rule will impact 
a document, the rule with the highest priority is applied to the item.  
 Figure 10-1.  Content Organizer Settings page 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
402
 
 c. 
 In the Submission’s Content Type section, do the following:
 
 i. 
 Identify the content type for the rule to act on by selecting the Group the 
content type is categorized under. Then select the content type. 
 
 ii.  Specify whether the content type has alternate names and, if it does, 
what they are. To specify alternate names, enter them in the Add 
Alternate Name box, and click the Add button to place the name in the 
List of Alternate Names section. 
 
 d. 
 In the Conditions section, identify the conditions under which to execute 
the rule. This includes identifying the property values that will make the 
item meet the rule’s conditions. 
 
 e. 
  In the Target Location section, identify the library to which to move the 
items meeting the rule and whether to place the items in folders. You can 
specify the property to base the folder name on and whether the name is to 
include the name of the property, its value, or both. 
 
 f. 
 Click the OK button to save the rule. 
 Figure 10-2.  New Rule page 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
403
 The rule is created and will be applied to content added to the Drop Off library. You can add other rules 
to support content routing. To edit them on the Content Organizer  Rules page , select the appropriate rule 
and then the Edit Item option from the Items ribbon tab.  
 Using Content Organizer 
 With rules in place, you can leverage content organizer to  route materials   based on the configured rules. To 
do this, follow these steps:
• 
 Upload items into the Drop Off library. Items added to the Drop Off library will be 
processed by the content organizer, which will identify the rule or rules that apply to 
the item being added. 
• 
 If no rules apply, the document is left in the Drop Off library. If content organizer was 
configured to send e-mail notifications to rule managers, the e-mail indicates that a 
document has been added to which no rules apply. 
• 
 If a single rule applies, that rule is executed and routes the document to the 
appropriate location. 
• 
 If multiple rules  apply , the rule with the highest priority is applied to the document. 
If multiple rules with equal priority apply, the first rule with that priority is applied to 
the document. 
 In working with content organizer, you may create rules that require information to be edited prior to 
routing the document to a final location. For example, if you allow people to upload contracts but want your 
legal department to review them before they are routed to the Contracts library, set the rule to run on the 
Contract content type when a Status field is set to Approved. Legal can access documents in the Drop Off 
library and update the Status field to Approved. Editing the Status field value then triggers the associated 
rule and moves the document to the library. 
 Managing Records 
 Whether you want to upload content to be saved as records or manage the development of materials that 
have reached the point in the lifecycle where they should be declared as records, you can manage the entire 
process of creating and maintaining records in SharePoint. Materials can be identified as records and locked 
from modification or removal, routed to different locations as they mature, and eventually be deleted to 
remove them from the environment. The management of overall record declaration and management 
settings within a site collection is configured at the site collection level. It can then be refined within specific 
lists and libraries. 
 Managing Site Collection Records Declaration Settings 
 Overall records management settings are configurable for a site collection when the In-Place Records 
Management site collection feature is activated. In-Place Records Management allows management of 
records in any list or library in a site collection. Once this  feature   is activated, record management options 
become available, and you can configure records management capabilities. These options define the default 
settings for declaring records in the site’s lists and libraries. The settings determine the level of restrictions 
placed on items declared records, including whether to allow their editing or  deletion  . The settings are also 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
404
used to determine whether manual record declaration can be performed and what rights levels users need 
to manually declare and undeclare records. To manage a SharePoint site collection’s record declaration 
settings, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
 On the  home page of the site, select the Site Settings option from the Settings 
menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the  Record Declaration Settings option   from the 
Site Collection Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Record Declaration Settings page (see Figure  10-3 ), do as follows:
 
 a. 
 In the  Record Restrictions section, from the following options select access 
restrictions to associate with documents locked as records:
• 
 No Additional Restrictions : Records will have the same access 
capabilities as standard items. With this option selected, a record can 
be edited or deleted like any other SharePoint item. 
• 
 Block Delete : Items declared as records cannot be deleted. With this 
option selected, records can only be edited. To delete an item declared 
a record, first undeclare it, then delete it.  
• 
 Block Edit and Delete : The default option for records. With this option 
selected, once an item is declared a record, it cannot be edited or 
deleted. To change a record, first undeclare it, then make the change. 
 
 b. 
 In the  Record Declaration Availability section, identify whether the ability to 
manually declare records is available by default in the site collection’s lists 
and libraries. 
 
 c. 
 In the Declaration  Roles section , identify the rights users need to declare 
and undeclare records. Set independently, these options let you require 
different rights levels for each activity. With both options configured, 
security levels available for selection are as follows:
• 
 All list contributors and administrators : The default for record 
declaration settings, this option specifies that the action can be 
performed by any individual having at least Contribute rights to the list 
or library. 
• 
 Only list administrators : The default for undeclaring records, this option 
specifies that only individuals with Administrative rights to the list or 
library can perform the activity. 
• 
 Only policy actions : Select this option when you do not want to allow 
any user, regardless of security rights, to declare or undeclare records. 
With this option selected, only information management policy 
processes can perform the action. 
 
 d. 
  Once the record declaration settings are appropriately  configured  , click the 
OK button to save the settings. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
405
 The settings are saved and applied to your entire site collection. You are returned to the Site Settings 
page. 
 Managing List and Library Record Declaration Settings 
 We have discussed how you can define records declaration settings for your overall site collection that 
impact all lists and  libraries in the SharePoint site collection. Many times, however, you will want to be 
more granular in configuring these capabilities and define only specific locations where manual records 
management is allowed. You can do this by configuring the record declaration settings for a list or library. 
These settings let you override the configuration settings defined at the site collection level for a specific list 
or library. You can determine whether to declare records in the selected list or library and identify whether 
items added to that location are automatically declared as records. To configure a list’s or  library’s record 
declaration settings , do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to manage record declaration 
settings. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List/Library Settings option from the 
List/Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Record Declaration Settings option from the 
Permissions and Management section. 
 Figure 10-3.  Record Declaration  Settings page 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
406
 
 4. 
 On the  Library Record Declaration Settings page (see Figure  10-4 ), select the 
following: 
 
 a. 
 In the Manual Record Declaration Availability section, specify whether to 
make manual records declaration available in the list or library. Select from 
the following options:
• 
 Use the site collection default settings : The default for all lists and 
libraries, this option bases the ability to manually manage records on 
the records management settings configured for the site collection itself 
(configuring the site collection’s record declaration settings is discussed 
earlier in the chapter). 
• 
 Always allow the manual declaration of records : With this option 
selected, users can manually declare records in the list or library. 
Security levels required to declare and undeclare actions are based on 
the selections made in the site collection’s record declaration settings. 
• 
 Never allow the manual declaration of records : With this option 
selected, list or library users are not permitted to declare records in that 
list or library. Only information management retention policies and 
workflow processes are able to declare and undeclare records in this 
location. 
 
 b. 
 In the Automatic Declaration section, identify whether new items added to 
the list or library are automatically declared as records. 
 
 c. 
 Once the record declaration settings for the list or library are configured, 
click the OK button. 
 Figure 10-4.  Library Record Declaration Settings page 
 The record declaration settings are saved and applied to the list or library. You are returned to the 
settings page for the list or library. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
407
 Manual  Records Declaration 
 As discussed earlier in this chapter, site collection and list or library records declaration settings are used to 
establish whether records can be manually declared and  undeclared in lists and libraries. At times you will 
want to enable individuals to manually declare records. For example, your process may not be well enough 
defined to create automated retention rules, or you may have a group in your organization that is responsible 
for reviewing and classifying items before they are declared records. 
 To manually declare records within a list or library where manual records declaration  settings are 
enabled, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to manually declare an item a 
record. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Compliance Details option from the list 
item’s context menu or the document’s hover panel menu. 
 
 3. 
 In the Compliance Details window (see Figure  10-5 ), click the Declare as a 
Record option in the Record Status section. 
 Figure 10-5.  Compliance Details window 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
408
 
 4. 
 In the confirmation window, click the OK button to confirm that the item is 
declared a record. 
 
 5. 
 The Compliance Details window is updated to show the Record Status as Record. 
Click the Close button to return to the list or library view.     
 The list or library view is updated to indicate the item is locked as a record (the lock indicator is added 
to the file’s icon, as Figure  10-6 shows). The file also becomes subject to the defined records management 
restrictions discussed earlier in this chapter. 
 Figure 10-6.  File locked as a record 
 To manually undeclare an item that is currently declared a record, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to undeclare an item a record.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Compliance Details option from the list 
item’s context menu or the document’s hover panel menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Compliance Details window (see Figure  10-5 ), click the Undeclare Record 
option in the Record Status section. 
 
 4. 
 In the confirmation window, click the OK button to confirm that the item is 
undeclared a record. 
 
 5. 
 The Compliance Details window is updated to show the record status as Not a 
Record. Click the Close button to return to the list or library view.     
 The item is no longer considered a record, and all record  management   restrictions are removed from 
the item.  
 Managing Records through Record Retention Rules 
 Record retention rules are defined as part of information management policies configured to automatically 
declare and undeclare items as records based on an item’s properties. These rules allow you to define 
record declaration and undeclaration settings as part of an item’s  lifecycle . This section covers how to 
configure retention policies to automatically declare and undeclare records (how to configure information 
management policies to address document retention and auditing needs is discussed in Chapter   9 ). 
 You might want to automatically manage  declaration and undeclaration   of records when you have 
materials that have a defined lifecycle and need protection to ensure they are not removed or edited once 
they reach a specific point in their development. For example, these rules may apply in managing contracts. 
You may have a corporate policy requiring copies of executed contracts to be maintained in the environment 
from the time they are made effective, the effective date, until ten years after they are no longer in effect—
the termination date. To support this policy, you can create an information management procedure that 
declares a document a record on the effective date, moves the item to an archive location on the termination 
date, and then deletes the item ten years after the termination date. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
409
 Configuring Retention Policies 
 Retention policies are configured within information management policies, which include a set of rules 
organized into stages, each representing a lifecycle stage of an item. The stages are defined by property 
values of the item. To create a retention policy, first identify the details by which the policy stages are 
to be defined and then the action to be taken when an item reaches that stage. To support the contract 
management example, let’s configure a retention policy similar to the one detailed in Table  10-1 .  
 Table 10-1.  Contract  Management Retention Policy Example 
 Stage Description 
 Event 
 Action 
 Recurrence 
 Contract Effective 
 Effective Date + 0 Years 
 Declare Record 
 No 
 Contract Terminated 
 Termination Date + 0 Years 
 Transfer to Another Location  No 
 10 Years after Contract 
Terminated 
 Termination Date + 10 Years 
 Permanently Delete 
 No 
 To  configure  a retention policy, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to configure the retention policy. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List/Library Settings option from the 
List/Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Information Management Policy Settings option 
from the Permissions and Management section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Information Management Policy Settings page, select the content type or 
library settings option to navigate to the Edit Policy page for the appropriate item 
(editing content type and library policies are discussed in Chapter   9 ). 
 
 5. 
  On the Edit Policy page, do the following:
 
 a. 
  In the Retention section, select the Enable Retention option. 
 
 b. 
  With the Enable Retention option selected, the Add a Retention Stage link 
appears. Click the link to open the Stage Properties window, where you can 
define the details for the records retention stage.  
 
 c. 
 In the Stage Properties window (see Figure  10-7 ), enter the following 
information: 
 
 i. 
 In the Event section, identify a date property to use for that stage of the 
item and a date offset value to identify when the policy stage is to take 
effect. For the contract management example discussed earlier in this 
section, identify a stage as Effective Date + 0 years to create a stage to 
take effect on the defined effective date. Alternatively in this section, 
choose a custom retention formula (formulas are configured in your 
SharePoint environment by a SharePoint technical administrator). If 
none are present, this option is disabled. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
410
 
 ii.  In the Action section, identify the activity that is to occur when the 
item enters the stage. In our contract’s effective date example, have the 
Declare Record option declare the item a record when the effective date 
is reached. Actions available for selection include the following:
• 
 Move to Recycle Bin : The item is deleted from the list or library, 
much as items are deleted manually. The item becomes subject to 
the recycle bin management rules. 
• 
 Permanently Delete : The item is deleted from the list or library. 
Since it is not placed in the recycle bin, it is unavailable for 
restoration. 
• 
 Transfer to Another Location : This option moves the item to 
a registered destination location in SharePoint. It requires 
configuring the location as a registered destination (how to do this 
is discussed in Chapter   10 ). 
• 
 Start a Workflow : An identified workflow is started when the 
configured event occurs against the item.  
• 
 Skip to Next Stage : This option causes the information management 
policy to transition to the next defined stage. The associated item is 
not changed in any way. 
• 
 Declare Record : This option locks the item as a record. It requires 
you to enable the In Place Records Management site collection 
feature in the  site collection.  
• 
 Delete Previous Drafts : Any previous draft versions stored in its 
version history are deleted, leaving only published versions.  
• 
 Delete All Previous Versions : All previous versions of the item stored 
in its version history are deleted, leaving only the current version.    
 
■ Note To declare items as records as part of a policy, enable the in-place records site collection feature. If 
this feature is not enabled, the Declare Record option is not available for selection. 
 
 iii.  In the Recurrence section, identify whether to repeat the assigned 
action for the item while it is in the stage and, if it is repeated, how 
frequently. The option to repeat the action within a stage is not available 
for all actions. 
 
 iv.  Once the details for the stage are configured, click the OK button. 
 
 d. 
  Once all of the retention stages are properly defined, click the OK button to 
save the policy. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
411
 The  information management policy is saved, and the defined retention policy is applied to the list or 
library. 
 Viewing  Item Retention Stage Details 
 When you configure a retention policy to impact an item in a list or library, you can view the item’s status to 
understand the stages the item has passed through, the stage it is in, and the stages it has not entered. This 
information appears in the Compliance Details window (see Figure  10-5 ). 
 Figure 10-7.    Stage  Properties   window       
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
412
 Record Centers 
 As was discussed in Chapter   2 , the Record  Center  site template   creates sites designed to store and manage 
records (see Figure  10-8 ). These sites contain many items we have previously discussed, such as content 
organizer, preconfigured within the site. Additional menu options and  management   pages to help you 
manage these resources are also made available. Use record centers when you want to create a site that can 
collect and manage company records. 
 Configuring Record Center  Sites 
 Sites created from the Record Center template need to be configured to support the types of documents 
to be managed within them. The configuration activities that need to be performed within this type of site 
include creating and adding content types representing documents supported by the record center to the 
Drop Off library and to created record libraries. (Creating and managing content types are discussed in 
detail in Chapter   9 .) For example, if you intend to use the record center site to manage contracts, you must 
create one or more content types with the proper column details to support the contract documents that are 
to be managed in the site and then associate the content types with the Drop Off library so that this type of 
file can be uploaded to the site. 
 Another part of configuring a record center site is creating record repository libraries. These libraries 
act as the final storage locations for content routed to the site. You will need to create one or more of these 
libraries depending on your document storage and organization requirements. To continue with the 
 Figure 10-8.  Record center site 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
413
contracts example, you might decide to add only a single record repository, called Contracts, in which to 
store all contract documents routed to the site. Alternatively, you might create a second record repository 
library, called Classified Contracts, with restricted security for storing employment agreements and other 
types of highly confidential contracts. Any record repository libraries must be configured with the content 
types representing the materials they will be used to manage. 
 
■ Note   The same content types used in the repository libraries to store documents should also be used in 
the Drop Off library to support uploading of the documents. The Drop Off library ought to contain the content 
types used in all of the record repository libraries in the site. 
 With the libraries where content is to be managed configured, you will need to create content organizer 
rules to route documents from the Drop Off library to the appropriate record repository libraries (how to 
create and manage these rules is discussed earlier in this chapter). Create the rules in record center sites to 
control routing of documents to the appropriate repository libraries. Within the Settings menu, these sites 
have an additional option (see Figure  10-9 ) that navigates you to the Record  Center   Management page.  
  Figure 10-9.  Settings menu in a record center site 
 The Record Center Management page is provided to list the steps necessary to configure the site. The 
page provides instructions on how to manage the details discussed so far, as well as to provide access to 
the Create and Manage Content Organizer Rules options. You can initiate the creation of a new content 
organizer rule or select an existing rule to be edited within the provided Content Organizer Rules view in the 
same way as you can access and manage these rules by selecting the Content Organizer options from the Site 
Settings page (discussed in the "Content Organizer" section). 
 To configure record center sites, you also need to create record retention policies that will determine 
documents’ lifecycles and manage any record declaration requirements needed for the items routed to the 
library. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
414
 Managing Documents in Record Center Sites 
 Once record center sites are configured, you can manage the collection and retention of  documents   in these 
sites. Documents can be uploaded to record center sites using any of the standard document upload options 
discussed in Chapter   7 , such as navigating to the Drop Off library and choosing the New Document option 
or selecting the Upload Document option from the Files menu. A record center, however, also includes 
a Submit a Record button on its home page. The button can be clicked to initiate the upload of a new 
document. 
 A new  document  uploaded to a record center site is listed in the My Records Pending Submission 
section until routed to its final retention library. Items listed in this section (as well as how long they are 
listed there) depend on defined content organizer rules and on whether any manual steps have to be 
performed on them before they can be routed to their final storage libraries. 
 Site administrators of record center sites can tailor these sites’ layout as needed to reflect their purposes 
and objectives. 
 Document Centers 
 Document center sites (see Figure  10-10 ) are designed to store and manage corporate documents. While 
record center sites (discussed earlier) include the resources necessary to automatically route materials to 
document libraries based on the document properties using content organizer, document center sites are 
the better choice when the goal is to have users upload documents directly into a document repository 
library, where they are expected to stay rather than be routed elsewhere. 
 Figure 10-10.  Document center sites 
 When created, a document center  site includes a single document library, called Documents, where 
uploaded materials are expected to reside. The site also includes a task list. Its purpose is to track activities 
related to the stored documents that need to be performed. As items are added to the library, they appear in 
the two library views listed on the document center’s home page.
• 
 Newest Documents : This view lists those documents most recently added to the 
library, in descending order by the Created date.  
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
415
• 
 Modified by Me : This view lists the documents in the library most recently modified 
by the user viewing the site. 
 The document center site’s home page also includes an Upload a Document button. It can be used to 
initiate the upload of a document into the site’s Documents library. 
 Document center sites , like others in SharePoint, support records management policies allowing 
materials in them to be subject to structured management processes. Manual records declaration can also 
be configured in these sites to support content retention requirements.  
 Content Holds  
 A content hold is used to identify content and suspend its expiration or deletion by users or expiration 
policies. Holds can be created in sites where the Hold  feature is active. Placing a hold in this way is called 
a local hold. By default record centers have the Hold feature enabled to support creation of local holds, 
whereas other sites need this feature activated to support local content holds. Holds can also be created 
within eDiscovery center portals. These portals, created with the eDiscovery center site collection template, 
are specifically designed to support the creation of cross-environment content holds that can be used to 
identify and hold content all across SharePoint, as well as from Microsoft Exchange mailboxes. (We discuss 
eDiscovery centers later in this chapter.) 
 Local Holds 
 Local holds are used to create locally managed content holds in the site where the content resides. They are 
useful when all of the content needing to be held is located within a single site. Local holds can be created in 
any site where the Hold site feature is activated. To activate the Hold  site feature  , do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to activate the Hold feature.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Manage Site Features option from the Site 
Actions section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Features page, click the Activate button for the Hold feature. 
 With the Hold feature activated, local hold functionality is available in the site. 
 Creating Local Holds 
 To  create  a hold in a site whose Hold feature is activated, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to create the local hold.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Holds option from the Hold section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Holds page, select the New Item option from the Items ribbon tab. 
 
 5. 
 On the Item Edit page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Enter a name for the hold. 
 
 b. 
  Enter an optional description for the hold.  

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
416
 
 c. 
 Enter the optional Managed By information used to identify the individual 
responsible for managing the hold. 
 
 d. 
 Click the Save button. 
 The new hold is  created in the site. 
 Adding  Items to Local Holds Individually 
 Once a local hold is created, you can identify items to be managed by the hold. Items added to the hold are 
restricted from being removed from the environment manually or with information management policies or 
workflows. To add an item to an existing hold, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the item to be added to the hold.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Compliance Details option from the list 
item’s context menu or the document’s hover panel menu. 
 
 3. 
 In the Compliance Details window, select the Add/Remove from Hold option 
from the Hold Status section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Item Hold Status screen, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Click the Add to a Hold option and select the hold to place the item in. 
 
 b. 
  Enter an optional comment for the hold of the item. The comment will be 
included in the audit log for the hold.  
 
 c. 
 Click the Save button to save the hold of the item. 
 The item is added to the selected hold and locked so that it cannot be edited or deleted. 
 Adding Items to Local Holds Through  Search 
 Picking individual documents to add to holds assumes you know which documents contain the information 
that triggers placement of the item in the hold. Often, however, you will not know all of the documents to 
include in a hold, nor will you be able to select them individually without reading through each item to 
determine whether it should be placed in the hold. In such a case, you can use search to locate the items to 
be added to the hold. To use search to identify items to add to a hold, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where content needs to be held. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, click the Discover and Hold Content option from the 
Hold section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Search and Add to Hold page, do the following:
 
 a. 
  In the Search Criteria section, enter terms to use to locate content through 
search and add it to the hold. Select the Preview Results option to view a list 
of items located by using the entered terms. 
 
 b. 
 In the Local Hold or Export section, identify how to handle items matching the 
criteria. Selecting the Keep in Place and Add to Hold Directly option adds items 
located by the search to the specified hold. Selecting Copy to Another Location 
and Add the Copy to a Hold creates copies of the identified items, placing them 
in the hold, and leaving the original documents untouched. If you select this 
option, also select a destination location to which to copy the items.  

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
417
 
 c. 
 In the Relevant Hold section, identify the hold to place the located items in, 
or choose to create a new hold. Creating a new hold opens the New Hold 
window (discussed in the "Create Local Holds" section of this chapter). 
 
 d. 
  Click the Add Results to Hold button to add the located items to the selected 
hold. 
 
 5. 
 On the confirmation screen for adding the request to the scheduled process, click 
the OK button. 
 The hold request is submitted to the scheduled  process   tasked with adding the items to the hold. The 
process searches for and locates the items and adds them to the hold.  
 Removing  Items from a Local Hold 
 Items added to a local hold can later be removed from the hold and returned to their previous state, where 
they can be managed by information management policies, by workflows, and manually. To remove an item 
from a local hold, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the item to be removed from the hold.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Compliance Details option from the list 
item’s context menu or the document’s hover panel menu. 
 
 3. 
 In the Compliance Details window, select the Add/Remove from Hold option 
from the Hold Status section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Item Hold Status screen, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Select the Remove from Hold option, and choose the hold from which the 
item is to be removed. 
 
 b. 
  Optionally enter a comment for the item’s removal from the hold. The 
comment is included in the audit log for the hold.  
 
 c. 
 Click the Save button to save the removal of the item from the hold. 
 Once the item is removed from the hold, the restrictions placed on it are released. 
 Viewing All Items in a Hold 
 To  view the list of items placed in a local hold, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to view the details of a local hold.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Hold Reports option from the Hold section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Hold Reports page, click the name of the hold report to view. 
 The selected hold report is opened and can be reviewed. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
418
 Viewing All Holds  Associated with an Item 
 We have discussed how to view all the items associated with a specific hold. To view all the holds associated 
with a specific item, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the item whose hold you want to view.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the Compliance Details option from the list 
item’s context menu or the document’s hover panel menu. 
 
 3. 
 In the Compliance Details window, select the Add/Remove from Hold option 
from the Hold Status section. 
 
 4. 
 Select the Remove from Hold drop-down list to see all of the holds associated 
with the item. 
 You can view the holds associated with the item and, if necessary, remove the item from a listed hold, as 
described in the "Remove an Item from a Local Hold" section in this chapter. 
 eDiscovery Center Holds 
 In addition to the local holds discussed so far in this chapter, SharePoint 2016 includes an eDiscovery center 
portal template that can be used to  create eDiscovery center sites (see Figure  10-11 ). (The elements included 
in the eDiscovery center sites are discussed in Chapter   2 .) 
 Figure 10-11.  eDiscovery center site 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
419
 eDiscovery centers are  site collections that include capabilities to create and manage content holds 
spanning the entire SharePoint environment and Microsoft Exchange mailboxes. eDiscovery centers are 
organized with the following structure to create and manage holds:
• 
 Cases : Subsites created in the eDiscovery center used to create and organize holds 
associated with a specific event. 
• 
 eDiscovery Sets : Specify the content sources from which the hold will locate content 
to be included and filters to be applied to identify the content. 
• 
 Queries : Identify the search criteria used to select hold content to be reviewed and 
exported.  
• 
 Exports : Identify extracts of the held content to be used to provide materials to 
appropriate parties. 
 Creating Cases 
 A  case , used to identify and organize content holds, is a site created to store holds associated with a specific 
event, typically a litigation event. Cases are created from the eDiscovery center home page as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the home of the eDiscovery center site. 
 
 2. 
 On the site home page, select the Create New Case option. 
 
 3.

Download Manager app window. 
 The eDiscovery Download Manager app closes, and the files or reports become available in the selected 
download  location . 
 In-Place Hold Policy Center 
 So far, we discussed how holds can be created against content in a site to ensure content is not changed 
or deleted to react to content retention needs, such as litigation support. In-place hold policies, see 
Figure  10-13 , are designed to combine the content retention concepts of records management with the 
search-based content identification and grouping performed by eDiscovery centers to allow for the 
creation of rules that can return content based on attributes of the materials.  

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT
423
 Creating In-Place Hold Policies 
 As discussed in Chapter   2 , in-place hold policy centers need to be created by a SharePoint technical 
administrator. Once an In-place hold policy center is available in-place hold policies can be created to 
manage the retention of content. To create an in-place hold, do the following:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the In-Place Hold Policy Center home site.  
 
 2. 
 Click the New Item option from the Manage In-Place Hold Policies section. 
 
 3. 
 On the Time Based In-Place Hold page, shown in Figure  10-14 , do the following: 
 
 a. 
 In the In-Place Hold Policy Name section, enter a name for the new policy. 
 
 b. 
 In the Sources section, click the Add & Manage Sources option to identify 
the site URLs that will be subject to the hold. On the displayed Add & 
Manage Sources screen, do the following:
 
 i. 
 Enter the URLs for the sites to include in the hold and then select the 
Check Location option to validate the location. 
 
 ii.  Once all locations are added, click the OK button. 
 
 c. 
 In the Filter section, enter the filter criteria that will be used to identify the 
content to be included in the hold. You can select the Search Syntax and 
Tips link to help understand how to create filter criteria. The Get Statistics 
option can then be clicked to understand the content that currently aligns 
with the entered filter criteria.

 Compliance Policy Center 
 Our focus so far in this chapter has been on retaining resources either proactively to address corporate 
records retention or to react to situations, such as litigation events, that require saving content specific to 
the situation. In this section, we shift our focus to removing content based on content expiration rules and 
identifying content that violates data protection policies and must be moved or removed. 
 Content expiration and data loss prevention policies are defined within compliance policy centers. 
Compliance policy centers are a specific type of site collections that must be created by a SharePoint 
technical administrator; see Figure  10-15 . We discussed the overall layout and structure of these sites in 
Chapter   2 . 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ RECORDS MANAGEMENT

 Summary 
 In this chapter, we reviewed the  resources SharePoint includes to help manage records. We discussed how 
content organizer is used to automatically organize content added to SharePoint sites based on predefined 
content management rules. We then discussed how to create and manage records to protect content from 
being altered or deleted and looked at how record centers can be used to centrally manage company 
records. We then shifted our conversation to document centers, which allow for the management of large 
volumes of documents providing more flexibility related to content structure and placement. We then 
discussed content holds and how they can be added in-place against the content where it is managed 
or through eDiscovery centers to retain materials. Lastly, we introduced in-place policy centers and 
compliance policy centers. We showed how in-place hold policy centers are used to manage time-based 
content holds and how compliance centers are used to manage the automated deletion of content based on 
business rules and how they can be used to report on violations of data loss prevention (DLP)  rules . 
 In the next chapter, we will focus our discussion on SharePoint Search capabilities, looking at how 
search can be configured and leveraged for content discovery and display.

 CHAPTER 11  
 Search 
 The SharePoint platform can be used to locate information across SharePoint and the rest of your enterprise 
providing a complete and comprehensive enterprise search experience. This platform allows searching 
a variety of sources, including SharePoint, Exchange, file shares, web content, and database content, and 
provides intelligent query management and robust result views. 
 Using SharePoint Search 
 SharePoint search offers a rich interface that allows you to search for and locate information, based on its 
content and associated properties. Results can then be refined and reviewed to isolate the desired materials. 
SharePoint combines several  features to create this robust search experience, including the following:
• 
 Content Crawling : Scans content to be included in a search. It identifies properties 
and security attributes used by query services to determine when to display crawled 
items to users as part of search results. 
• 
 Query Services : Allows specification of information to be used by the SharePoint 
search to find content to display in search results.  
• 
 Query Results : Organizes and displays results of executed queries.  
• 
 Refiners : Lets you identify details to be used to further filter listed results based on 
defined properties related to the results. 
 All of these capabilities come together to provide the SharePoint 2016 search experience. 
 Performing a Search 
 SharePoint offers several  interfaces   to help you take full advantage of its search services to locate relevant 
information. These interfaces support searches in the overall environment or specific sites, lists, and 
libraries. 
 Searches can be initiated from any  site page within SharePoint. Whether a page is a web part, a wiki, 
or a publishing page, the search box is at the top of the page to give you easy access to search services. 
The search interface either provides a standard search box, as shown in Figure  11-1 , or a search box with 
integrated options, which allow selection of verticals to use in targeting the search (see Figure  11-2 ). When 
you execute a search from the  site’s search box , the scope will initially default to the current site, but you can 
expand it to search across the entire environment instead.   

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
432
 You can also initiate a search in list and library views. A search box is part of list and library view 
headers (see Figure  11-3 ), next to the views list. Searches performed in a list or library view are scoped to 
return results just from the associated list or library. 
 Figure 11-1.  Standard search box 
 Figure 11-2.  Search box with sources 
 Figure 11-3.  List or library view  search 
 Finally, you can initiate a search in search pages. Whether your environment uses the standard search 
page or a search center, the search page includes a search box similar to the one found on a normal site 
page. A search page search is initially scoped to search all available crawled content. 
 To perform a search in SharePoint, navigate to any of the search boxes described and enter the search 
text you want to use. When the search box allows the selection of verticals, you can also identify the desired 
vertical to run the search against. The executed search will then scope to the appropriate content set and 
navigate you to the search results page. 
 Working with Search Results 
 Once a search is performed, search  results are presented. The results returned for a search include items 
that meet the search criteria contained in the identified scope, that the user performing the search has rights 
to access. That is, search results will not include content that the searcher does not have at least read access 
to. The order of the results returned is determined by the items’ relevance, which is based on a variety of 
factors, including how closely the result meets the query, how active or current the item is, and how relevant 
the item is to the searcher. Presentation of  results returned is further defined by additional factors, including 
whether result blocks are defined and the result type definitions in use. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
433
 Result Blocks 
 Query rules can be created within SharePoint search to define rules to extend search queries beyond 
standard search text queries. These rules are made up of a set of conditions and actions that are executed 
when search text meets identified conditions. Result blocks, defined as part of query rules, group sets of 
highly relevant content. For example, a search for “sales videos” would typically search crawled content 
for items containing those words or that phrase and return those items. However, when a search for 
“sales videos” is run, it is more likely the searcher is looking for video files related to sales than for content 
containing those two words. A default query rule in SharePoint specifies that when the word “video” is used 
in a search, the query should look for video files. The query can be extended so that when “sales videos” 
is the query text, the most relevant content would be video files in the Sales site. Such highly relevant 
content can be presented in a result block (see Figure  11-4 ), which groups these items and so elevates their 
importance above the other returned results. 
 Figure 11-4.  Result block 
 Promoted Results 
 Much as query rule actions are used to create result blocks, query rule actions can be used to define 
promoted results, which are result items defined by a rule to always appear at the top of the search result set 
when searches meeting the query rule conditions are executed. For example, if you have a specific approved 
company logo file that should be used whenever the logo is needed, you may create a query rule that returns 
the logo file as the most relevant result when a search is performed for “company logo”. 
 Standard Search Results 
 Beyond specialized result blocks and promoted results, a search yields a set of standard search results that 
list materials matching the executed search. The layout of listed search results is based on the type of items 
listed, called result types. For example, documents and discussion items have different search result layouts. 
The layout of the items in the results is defined for each result type based on the display template associated 
with that result type. The display templates define the item details to list in the results and how these details 
are organized. 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
434
 The standard search results view also includes a hover panel for each listed result. This panel lists 
additional details about the item in a format also determined by the display template for the associated 
result type. The hover panel, which appears when the mouse hovers over the item, can provide in-depth 
information about the item and organize actions available to be performed against it. To continue the 
example of the discussion item and the document, hovering over a discussion item shows a listing of 
the details for the item, including the discussion text and the original post the item is associated with 
(see Figure  11-5 ). The hover panel also includes options to navigate to the item and to the associated 
discussion.  
 Figure 11-5.  Discussion item hover  panel 
 A Word document’s hover panel (see Figure  11-6 ) incorporates a preview along with general details 
about the document. With this hover panel you can also open the document, follow it, send it, navigate to 
the associated library, and if you have the rights, edit it. 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
435
 
■ Note   Office Online Server must be installed and configured in your SharePoint environment for document 
previews to appear in the hover panel. 
 Items listed as search results are organized by relevance, which is a ranking given based on how well 
items seem to meet the query. Relevance rankings are based on a complex formula that includes factors 
such as property weighting, query authority, and freshness. 
 Refiners 
 Refiners are sets of filters found to the left of the search results. They can be used to further filter those 
results. Refiners are a set of defined attributes whose values are based on those found in the returned 
content. By default, the refinement panel allows filtering by result type, author, and date modified. This list, 
however, can be expanded or otherwise changed by having a SharePoint technical administrator configure 
additional refiners. Refiners can be text options that, when clicked, filter results, or they can be graphical 
tools that allow more advanced filtering. For example, the Modified Date refiner appears as a slider that lets 
you adjust the time frame by sliding a ruler within the graphic (see Figure  11-7 ).

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH

 Working with Search  Centers  
 A standard search initiated in SharePoint from the standard search box (see Figure  11-1 ) is executed through 
the default search page, the  OSSSearchResults.aspx page, or a search center. These search pages allow 
 results to be displayed, refiners to be leveraged, and additional searches to be performed. 
 The standard SharePoint search results page provides a rich search  query   and results  management   
interface incorporating the various search capabilities of SharePoint. However, should you want to extend 
these capabilities, you can access more advanced filtering or introduce a customizable search page to meet 
specific organizational needs. Search centers allow this sort of advanced search management. Two search 
center templates can be leveraged to create search center sites, which you can use as locations for routing 
and execution of searches. 
 Standard SharePoint Search Centers 
 By default, two search center templates are available: the basic search center and the enterprise search 
center. These templates are used to create search center sites configurable as primary search pages in a 
SharePoint environment. 
 Basic Search Centers 
 Basic search center sites provide an interface that lets standard searches be performed against the 
SharePoint search service, as shown in Figure  11-8 . 
 Figure 11-7.  Modified Date refiner 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
437
 A basic search center presents all of the search results and refiner details discussed earlier in this 
chapter and allows you to perform additional searches from the search center home page. Basic search 
center sites, however, do not include the ability to select different verticals over which to execute a search. 
They are designed to allow standard search execution and results management without advanced source 
filtering. 
 Enterprise Search Centers 
 Enterprise search center sites (see Figure  11-9 ) provide all of the capabilities of the basic search centers and 
also allow selection of available verticals that you can use for targeted searches. 
 Figure 11-8.  Basic search  center 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
438
 By default, the  enterprise search center lets you perform searches over the following sources of content:
• 
 Everything : All content crawled by SharePoint 
• 
 People : SharePoint users 
• 
 Conversations : SharePoint social discussions 
• 
 Videos : Video files 
• 
 Reports : Report files; this option is not available by default but can be added by 
activating the necessary features 
 You can limit the executed query to the selected content, which brings you to a site’s search page used 
to perform queries and display results for the selected vertical.   
 Executing Advanced Searches 
 One benefit of using a search center instead of the default search page is that you can perform advanced 
searches. In a standard search in SharePoint, the text you enter is used to locate matching material based 
on the items’ content and associated properties. These searches look across all crawled elements to identify 
whether there is a match to the query details entered.  Advanced searches allow you to more granularly 
specify search terms. You can locate entered text in specific columns, locate exact phrases, exclude items 
containing identified content, and limit results based on language. 
 To access the Advanced Search page in a search center site, select the Advanced link located at the 
bottom of the search center page. The Advanced Search page (see Figure  11-10 ) allows entry of specific 
search criteria to granularly target the search. 
 Figure 11-9.  Enterprise search center 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
439
 On the Advanced Search page, you can specify any combination of the following details to perform 
targeted searches against the content in your SharePoint environment:
• 
 All of these words : Specifies that items are returned only if they contain all words 
entered in the field. 
• 
 The exact phrase : Specifies that items are returned only if they contain the exact 
phrase entered, not just the words included in the phrase. 
• 
 Any of these words : Specifies that results are returned if they contain any items 
entered in this field. 
• 
 None of these words : Specifies words that, when found, exclude an item from 
returned results. 
• 
 Only the language(s) : Limits returned items to those containing content only in the 
selected language or languages. 
 Figure 11-10.  Advanced  Search page 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
440
• 
 Result type : Limits returned items to a specifically selected type, such as a Word 
document or PowerPoint presentation. 
• 
 Add property restrictions : Allows selection of specific item attributes on which to 
search for details. You can identify multiple properties and specify conditions for 
each property where results are to be returned. For example, select a Date field from 
the list of properties to specify that you want to locate items whose column value falls 
on or before an entered  date . 
 Configuring the  Site Collection to use a Search Center 
 When you configure a site collection to use a search center, you specify that searches performed in the site 
will be routed to the search center for execution instead of to the standard SharePoint search results page. To 
configure a site collection to use a search center, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection. 
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Search Settings option from the Site 
Collection Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Site Collection Administration Search Settings page (see Figure  11-11 ), do 
the following: 
 
 a. 
  In the Enter a Search Center URL section, enter the URL to the basic or 
enterprise search center to be used in performing searches in the site 
collection. 
 
 b. 
 In the Which Search Results Page Should Queries Be Sent To section:
 
 i. 
 Specify whether the page is to use the same results page as the parent.  
 
 ii. 
  If you are not using the same results page, select whether to specify a 
results page. If you do, either select the page to use, or turn on the drop-
down menu in the search box and use the first node as the results page. 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
441
 The  site collection is updated to use the search center specified, and you are returned to the Site 
Settings page.  
 Configuring a Site to use a Search Center 
 At times you might want to override the site collection search center settings for a specific site within 
the collection. This may happen if you are interested in leveraging a different view of the search page or 
a different search results layout when performing a search in a specific site. To update the search center 
 settings for a specific site, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where you want to configure the search center.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Search Settings option from the Search 
section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Search Settings page, do the following:
 
 a. 
  In the Enter a Search Center URL section, enter the URL to the basic or 
enterprise search center to be used when searching in the site collection. 
 
 b. 
 In the Which Search Results Page Should Queries Be Sent To section:
 
 i.

 ii. 
  If you are not using the same results page, select whether to specify a 
results page. If you do, either select the page to use, or turn on the drop-
down menu in the search box and use the first node as the results page. 
 
 c. 
 In the Configure Search Navigation section, identify any links you want to 
list in the Quick Launch area of the search page. Do this by clicking the Add 
Link option and entering the following details:
 
 i. 
 Title for the link. 
 
 ii. 
 URL for the link. Specify whether to open it in a new window. 
 
 iii.  An optional description for the link. 
 
 iv.   Optional audience details. Specify target groups to make the link 
available to. 
 
 v. 
 C lick the OK button to save the link. 
 
 d. 
 Click the OK button to save the search center settings details. 
 The site is updated to take advantage of the search center  specified   , and you are returned to the Site 
Settings page. 
 Crawling Capabilities 
 SharePoint crawling  services can be configured to make content in SharePoint, Exchange, file shares, web 
sites, and databases available when searches are performed. The crawl capabilities of SharePoint differ 
depending on the version of SharePoint you have in your environment.
• 
 SharePoint Server Standard Search : SharePoint Server Standard provides enterprise 
content crawling capabilities that allow crawling of content in a variety of sources, 
including SharePoint, Exchange, file shares, and web sites. SharePoint Standard 
Search, however, cannot crawl database content.  
• 
 SharePoint Server Enterprise Search : The search services of SharePoint Server 
Enterprise crawls the types of content SharePoint Server Standard search crawls as 
well as database content by means of Business Connectivity Services connections. 
 Defining content to be crawled and configuring the crawls’ properties, including their frequency, are 
managed by SharePoint technical administrators through the SharePoint Central Administration site. Some 
configurations however, can be made in site collections to identify elements to be included or excluded by 
the search services. 
 Managing Managed Properties 
 Crawled properties identify list and library properties to be crawled for inclusion in search. Executing a 
query searches for the query text across document content and all of the crawled properties. When columns 
are added to lists and libraries, they become, by default, crawled properties. Crawled  properties can be 
extended by making them managed properties. Managed properties are list and library properties that can 
be specifically referenced by search queries when performing searches. This allows for searching only within 
a specific column. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
443
 For example, you would use managed  properties if you manage documents related to a specific 
product. These documents may have a property, called Product, that identifies the product the document is 
associated with. Performing a general search across these product documents for those related to a specific 
product would return all documents that reference that product name in any way instead of limiting the 
search to only the items specifically identified as related to the product. For instance, several documents 
that contain footnotes may reference the product but in no other way relate to it. Since these footnote 
references exist, a search for the product name returns these items. If you specify that the Product property 
be configured as a managed property, the crawling service will know not only to index the fact that the 
product name was referenced as part of the document details but also to maintain the property and property 
value relationship. Specific searches can then be performed using the Product property and identifying 
the documents where the Product column contains the desired product name. The results you get are then 
limited to just those items specifically identified as related to the desired product. 
 Managed properties can be defined by IT technical administrators in the SharePoint Central 
Administration site to make them available in all site collections in a SharePoint environment. However, 
managed properties can also be created in a specific site collection for use only within that context. 
 Creating Site Collection Managed  Properties 
 Creating site collection managed properties defines directly searchable properties in the site collection. 
Managed properties created at this level have some limitations compared to those created by SharePoint 
technical administrators in Central Administration. Limitations include the following:
• 
 Site collection level managed properties support only the creation of Text and Yes/
No type properties. Other formats, including Integer, Decimal, Date and Time, 
Double Precision Float, and Binary, are not supported at this level. 
• 
 Managed properties created at the site collection level cannot be made sortable or 
refinable. 
• 
 Site collection level managed properties can be used only in the site collection they 
are created in. 
 To create a new site collection managed  property , do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Search Schema option from the Site 
Collection Administration section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Managed Properties page (see Figure  11-12 ), select the New Managed 
Property option. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH

 In the Alias section, enter an alias name to use when referencing the 
managed property if you want to manage the property by a name other than 
the defined managed property name itself. 
 
 j. 
  In the Token Normalization section, leave the Token Normalization option 
checked. 
 
 k. 
 In the Complete Matching section, check the Complete Matching option 
only if you want queries executed against the property to find the value if 
only the full value of the field is used. For example, if the property value 
is “butterfly” and the search is for “butter”, when the Complete Matching 
option is checked, the item is not returned.  
 
 l. 
 In the Mappings to Crawled Properties section, click the Add a Mapping 
option. Then in the Crawled Property Selection window, search for and 
select the crawled property to connect to the managed property. Then click 
OK to save the association. 
 
 m.   In the Company Name Extraction section, check the Company Extraction 
option if you want to scan the managed property for company names when 
it is crawled. If a company name is part of the value, search results can be 
filtered through refiners by this value. 
 
 n. 
 In the Custom Entity Extraction section, specify whether to scan the 
managed property for any custom word or word part extractions to allow 
filtering through refiners by a custom refiner set. Select these options only if 
the custom extraction dictionaries are in use. Custom extraction dictionaries 
must be configured by a SharePoint technical administrator.  
 
 o. 
 Click the OK button. 
 The new managed  property is added. It becomes available upon completion of a full crawl of the 
content that uses the managed property. 
 Editing the Details of an Existing Managed Property 
 You can update the properties of an existing managed  property   in order to change the configuration of the 
item to meet the search needs of information contained within the corresponding crawled properties. To 
edit the details of an existing managed property, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu.

 b. 
 In the Properties list select the Delete option from the item’s context menu. 
 
 5. 
 In the deletion confirmation window, click the OK button.     
 The managed property is removed from the site collection. 
 Reindexing a List or  Library 
 At times you might want to have the SharePoint crawling services recrawl the content throughout the 
environment or in a specific list or library—for example, when you remove a large number of documents 
from a library or move a large number of documents to a new location. You need to reindex the content for 
such changes to be reflected. 
 Reindexing of your entire environment must be done by a SharePoint technical administrator. However, 
a specific list or library can be flagged for reindexing when the next scheduled crawl is run in the list or 
library itself. To flag a list or library for reindexing during the next scheduled crawl, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library you want reindexed.  

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
447
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the Reindex List or Reindex Document Library 
section, click the Reindex List or Document Library button. 
 
 5. 
 In the Reindex List or Reindex Document Library window, click the Reindex List 
or Reindex Document Library button. 
 The list or library is flagged to be reindexed, and you are returned to the Advanced Settings page.  
 Excluding Sites from Search 
 If you specify that a site is not included in search results, content in the identified site will be excluded from 
the content crawl, and this content will not appear in search results. This is done as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site you want to exclude from the search.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings menu, select the Search and Offline Availability option from 
the Search section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Search and Offline Availability page, select No for the Allow This Site to 
Appear in Search Results? option and click the OK button. 
 The site is excluded from search, and its contained content is not listed in search results.  
 Excluding a List or Library from Search 
 You can configure a specific list or library to be excluded from search. You would do this to limit the 
exposure of the content in the list or library by making it available only to users browsing to it directly. When 
you exclude a list or library from search, the rest of the site’s content continues to participate in search 
results. Only the selected list or library is excluded. To exclude a list or library from search, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library that you want to exclude from search. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the Search section, select No for the Allow 
Items from this List or Document Library to Appear in Search Results? option 
and click the OK button. 
 The list or library is excluded from search and you are returned to the Settings page. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
448
 Excluding List or Library Columns from Search 
 At times you will want to keep content of a list or library available through search but not want it to crawl all 
of the list or library columns. You might, for example, have a Notes column where general comments about 
an item are placed. If crawled, the column’s contents would dilute a search’s effectiveness. You want Notes 
left uncrawled so its content does not influence search results. To exclude a column from search, do the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the site where the column is to be excluded from search.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, click the Searchable Columns link in the Search 
section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Searchable Columns page, check the check box for the column to be 
excluded from search and click the OK button.     
 The selected column is excluded from search, and you are returned to the Site Settings page.   
 SharePoint  Query Capabilities 
 The query capabilities of SharePoint define  services and features related to performing search requests. 
Search requests identify criteria used to locate content crawled by the SharePoint search services. SharePoint 
2016 provides several configurable options that can be tailored to align the  environment’s   query capabilities 
with your information searching needs. 
 Managing Query Rules 
 One of the most powerful tools available for configuring search queries are query rules. Query rules allow 
you to define conditions that, when met as part of entered search criteria, make a corresponding action 
occur. These actions help improve search relevance by refining details returned in specific scenarios. For 
example, if you expect people in the organization to search for videos, and you want to ensure that a search 
performed with the word “video” returns video files, a query rule can be used to specify that the use of the 
word “video” indicates that specific types of files, such as  .wmv or  .mp4 files, are to be located instead of 
simply any items that contain the word “video”. 
 Adding Query Rules 
 When a SharePoint technical administrator creates query rules in SharePoint Central Administration, you 
can use them across your SharePoint environment. Creating a query rule in a site collection or site limits the 
rule’s impact to that specific site collection or site. To create a site collection query rule, do the following:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the root site in the site collection where you want to create a new 
query rule. 
 
 2. 
  On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
  On the Site Settings page, select the Search Query Rules option from the Site 
Collection Administration section. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
449
 
 4. 
 On the Manage Query Rules page. do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the For What Context Do You Want To Configure Rules? section, identify 
the context in which to apply the new query rule. The context information 
that can be selected includes the following:
• 
 Result Sources : Identifies the type of result the query rule is based on. 
• 
 User Segment : Defaults to All User Segment. This option lets you limit 
the query rule’s application to a specific user segment. 
• 
 Topic Categories : Defaults to All Topic Categories. Lets you select 
specific topic categories to limit the rule to. 
 
 b. 
 In the New Query Rule section, click the New Query Rule link to open the 
Add Query Rule page. 
 
 5. 
 On the Add Query Rule page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the General Information section, enter a name for the new query rule. 
 
 b. 
  Optionally expand the Context section, and do the following:
 
 i. 
 For Sources, specify whether to expand the query rule to include all 
sources, or click the Add Sources link and pick an additional source for 
the rule to act upon. Save this source to add it to the sources list.  
 
 ii. 
 For Categories, choose whether to use the query rule on all categories 
or on select categories. If you click Add Categories to open the 
Categories Search, you can search for and select term store categories 
and save these to the list of categories that the query rule is to be 
associated with. 
 
 iii.  For User Segments, decide whether to use all user segments, or select 
the Add User Segment option to add user segments and user segment 
terms to be leveraged as part of the query rule. 
 
 c. 
 In the Query Conditions  section , identify the condition in which to invoke 
the query rule and the condition values. Add more conditions by selecting 
the Add Alternate Condition link, and then enter the additional conditions 
and condition values. 
 
 d. 
 In the Actions section, do the following:
 
 i. 
 To add a Promoted Result, click the Add Promoted Result link. On the 
Add Promoted Result page, specify the title and URL for the promoted 
result and whether it is to appear as a banner or hyperlink. Optionally

 Search Result Capabilities 
 Search results in SharePoint 2016 are designed to provide highly relevant details for search queries. Search 
results are configured to be easy to work with and to let you easily identify materials meeting your specific 
needs. SharePoint has several capabilities for organizing search results and presenting them to users. This 
section discusses those capabilities and how to manage them. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
453
 Managing Result Sources 
 Result sources identify the set of  materials a search query will run through to locate content. Your SharePoint 
environment can include multiple result sources, some within SharePoint and others outside it. The 
following details are used to define  query rules :
• 
 The source location for the materials to be searched.  
• 
 The protocol, such as OpenSearch, to be used to retrieve results.  
• 
 Any narrowing conditions, such as limiting items to a specific type of file or content 
type. 
 There are several default result sources available in SharePoint 2016, including the items listed in 
Table  11-1 .

 Result sources, like  query rules , can be created at three levels in SharePoint:
• 
 Centrally, for use in the entire SharePoint environment by SharePoint technical 
administrators using the SharePoint Central Administration site.  
• 
 Within a site collection, for use in an entire site collection. 
• 
 Within a specific site, for use only in that site.

type of item returned in a search result (such as Word Documents, PDF files, videos, and so on) has its own 
display template, used to identify the layout of the item’s details when they appear in search results This 
includes the hover panel details displayed when a mouse hovers over an item in the search results page. As 
with result sources, result types can be created in any of the following levels in SharePoint:
• 
 Within the SharePoint Central Administration environment, by a SharePoint 
technical administrator for use across the entire SharePoint environment.

 Exporting and Importing Search Configurations 
 You have seen how to manage the various aspects of search at a site-collection level as well as at a site 
level. Once you have configured search the way that you want, you may decide that the configuration is 
appropriate for another site collection or site in your environment. In SharePoint 2016, you can export 
customized search configurations and then import them into other site collections and sites to replicate a 
search configuration you created. The export and import process includes all of the settings configured for 
query rules, result sources, result types, ranking models, and general site search settings.

 Using Search with Web Parts 
 SharePoint has several web parts that leverage search services to present information in site pages. These 
web parts offer an alternative approach to use crawled content. They also provide ways to show content 
roll-ups collecting details throughout the environment, using a method that has no negative impact on the 
performance of the environment. 
 Content Search Web Part 
 The most versatile SharePoint search web part is the  Content Search   web part. It can be configured to 
present various types of content. This web part is only available in SharePoint Server Enterprise. 
 The content and layout of the information presented in the Content Search web part is dictated by 
the web part’s configuration, which is managed through its properties. To configure a Content Search web 
part, add it to the appropriate page using the Add Web Parts options (the web part is located in the Content 
Roll-Up category). Then edit the web part properties (adding web parts to pages and configuring them is 
discussed in Chapter   4 ). On the web part properties page, do the following:
 
 1. 
 In the Search Criteria Section:
 
 a. 
  Click the Change Query button to define the query on which the search 
results presented is to be based. Do so as follows:
 
 i. 
 On the Basics tab:
 
 1. 
 In the Select a Query section, identify the result source to use as the 
basis for the query. 
 
 2. 
 In the Restrict by App section, specify whether to scope the search 
to include only items in a certain location.  
 
 3. 
 In the Restrict by Tag section, specify whether to restrict results by 
tags associated with the content. 
 
 ii. 
  On the Refiners tab, select refiner values to further limit search results 
presented and click the Add button to add any refiners to the Selected 
Refiners list. 
 
 iii.  On the Settings tab:
 
 1. 
 In the Query Rules section, identify whether to make results listed 
in the search web part subject to any defined query rules. 
 
 2. 
 In the URL Rewriting section, identify whether items returned from 
a catalog are to use the catalog’s URL settings. 
 
 3. 
 In the Loading Behavior section, specify whether to execute the 
query synchronously, from the server, or asynchronously, from the 
client. Running the query synchronously prevents the page from 
loading until the query is executed and results can be listed in the 
page. Running the query asynchronously allows the page itself 
to load more quickly as it loads separately from the query being 
executed and the results presented in the web part. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH
463
 
 4. 
 In the Priority section, identify the priority level of the query’s 
execution within the search service. This establishes an order of 
execution in the event that the search service is overloaded and 
multiple queries are queued for execution. 
 
 5. 
 In the Caching section, identify the caching model. You can choose 
to do no caching, cache for all users, or for a specific group.      
 
 iv.  On the Test tab, run the defined query to view the results that will be 
returned. 
 
 v. 
 Click the OK button. 
 
 b. 
  Identify the maximum number of results to show in the web part. 
 
 2. 
 In the Display Templates  section ,
 
 a. 
  Identify the layout for the web part. Choose whether to show items as a list, 
as a list that allows paging, or in a slideshow format. 
 
 b. 
  Select the item display format identifying the layout of individual items in 
the web part. There are several display format options.
• 
 Diagnostics : Shows the link and managed property details for the listed 
items. 
• 
 Large Picture : Represents each item using a single preview image 
associated with the item. 
• 
 Picture on Left, 3 Lines on Right : Lists a preview image with the item’s 
details to the right of the image.  
• 
 Picture on Top, 3 Lines on Bottom : Shows the preview image appears 
with the item’s details below the image. 
• 
 Recommended Items: Picture on Left, 3 Lines on Right : Has the same 
layout as the Picture on Left, 3 Lines on Right format but shows the 
recommended items from the query. 
• 
 Two Lines : Lists each item’s properties. 
• 
 Video : Provides a video player thumbnail for each item. If it is a video, 
details are shown below the player. 
 
 c. 
 Specify whether to display anything in the web part if no results are 
returned. 
 
 3. 
 In the Property Mappings section, identify whether to map the properties used in 
the display template to the default item properties for those elements or to other 
item properties. You can remap the Picture URL, Link URL, Line 1, Line 2, and 
Line 3. 
 
 4. 
 In the Settings  section :
 
 a. 
 Identify whether displayed query results are to be provided by the web part 
itself or by some other web part on the page. 
 
 b. 
  Identify the results table to be used when identifying results, with options 
including PersonalFavoriteResults, RefinementResults, RelevantResults, and 
SpecialTermResults. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ SEARCH

part generates an error. 
 
 5. 
 Click the OK button in the web part properties. 
 The web part  properties are saved, and the web part is updated to reflect the new configuration.  
 Other Search Web Parts 
 Besides the Content Search web part, there are several other standard SharePoint web parts that take 
advantage of the search service to display content. Because the components that make up the standard 
search pages are web parts that are also available within the web part listing and that can be added to and 
configured in other pages, you can create your own specialized search pages. You can find these web parts 
in the Search category when you add web parts to a page (adding web parts to pages is discussed in detail in 
Chapter   4 ). These web parts include the following:
• 
 Search Box :  Shows a standard SharePoint search box, such as may be seen in the 
standard SharePoint search page. 
• 
 Search Results : Lists search results based on an executed search query. 
• 
 Refinement : Lists the  refinement panel, which allows filtering of listed search results.  
• 
 Search Navigation : Lists search verticals, which can be used to scope the search 
query being performed. 
• 
 Taxonomy  Refinement  Panel : Lists refiners based on term set data. Refiners can be 
used to filter listed search results. 
 Along with the standard search component web parts that you can use to construct your own search 
pages, there is a second set of web parts that take advantage of the search services to display specific content 
within SharePoint pages. These web parts, available in the Search-Driven Content category, include the 
following:
• 
 Catalog-Item Reuse : Displays items contained in a catalog. 
• 
 Items Matching a Tag : Lists items  tagged with a specific term. 
• 
 Pages : Lists items based on the Pages content type. 
• 
 Pictures :  Lists items based on the Picture or Image content types 
• 
 Popular Items : Displays items identified as most popular—that is, those defined as 
items viewed by the most people. 
• 
 Recently Changed Items : Lists items most recently  modified . 
• 
 Recommended Items : Lists  recommended content based on content 
recommendation rules. 
• 
 Videos : Lists items based on the  Video content type . 
• 
 Web Pages :  Displays items based on the Pages content type. 
• 
 Wiki Pages : Lists items based on the Wiki Page content type.

 Summary 
 In this chapter, we focused our discussion on the SharePoint Search capabilities. We demonstrated how to 
perform basic and advanced searches and reviewed the layout and capabilities available within the search 
results. We then discussed how to configure search capabilities such as managed properties, query rules, 
result blocks, and result sources. We also described how to exclude sites, lists, libraries, and columns from 
search. Finally, we looked at web parts that take advantage of search. 
 In the next chapter, we will discuss the personalization and social features available in SharePoint such 
as the SharePoint profile, alerting, newsfeeds, and following content.

 CHAPTER 12  
 Personalization and Social 
Features 
 SharePoint 2016 contains a comprehensive set of personalization features that enhance personal 
productivity and contains a set of social features that facilitate team development, communication, and 
collaboration. The personalization features streamline personal productivity and enhance awareness of 
relevant activities. Combining these features allows individuals to come together into teams that focus on 
similar activities, which enable peer knowledge sharing, support, and idea capture and development. 
 In this chapter, we review the personal productivity and social capabilities that make up SharePoint 
2016 and discuss how to take advantage of these resources. These capabilities do the following:
• 
 Enhance Personal Productivity : By providing capabilities that help individuals keep 
current on information important to them, easily manage activities related to them, 
and find information and people they need based on skill sets and knowledge. 
• 
 Share and Extend Content : By allowing information to be shared and commented on 
and tracking its value and use. 
• 
 Build Communities : By facilitating the development of communities that bring 
people together around common topics of interest, promoting discussions, and 
fostering collaboration. 
 Enhancing Personal Productivity 
 SharePoint includes several capabilities designed to help make individuals more productive by reducing the 
amount of time needed to locate information and by allowing them to be kept aware of changes to relevant 
information and activities. Previous chapters discussed how processes can be automated through workflow 
to enhance efficiencies and how searches can be used to locate needed materials. Personal productivity 
 tools  in SharePoint augment these other capabilities and enable the following:
• 
 Identifying materials relevant to you and allowing you to stay aware of changes to 
this information. 
• 
 Monitoring activities performed by individuals involved in related tasks and keeping 
you aware of any impactful events. 
• 
 Locating people you need based on their skills, relationships, or knowledge.    
 In this section, the personalization and social features that enhance personal productivity in SharePoint 
are discussed. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
468
 About Me and the Profile 
 SharePoint  users’ profiles are used as the foundation on which the SharePoint personal productivity and 
social capabilities are based. The profiles contain details about users that support communicating relevant 
information and representing users in the environment. Details include contact information, profile 
pictures, notification preferences, and more. 
 Many details included in the profile are centrally managed and typically populated from Active 
Directory or other sources of people demographic data, such as HRIS systems. Examples of the demographic 
details pulled from these systems include e-mail addresses, names, and titles. Other details are available for 
users to edit themselves in the profile management tools, including a profile picture and About Me details. 
Information available in the profile and edit settings are configured and managed by SharePoint technical 
administrators in the SharePoint Central Administration tools. 
 About Me Page  Shared View 
 The About Me page in SharePoint has a dual purpose. When other people access someone’s About Me 
page, they see its public view. This view (see Figure  12-1 ) lists key details about the person, including the 
following:
• 
 About Me : Lists the self-descriptive About Me text created by the individual. 
• 
 Ask Me About : Lists topics the person has identified themselves as being 
knowledgeable about. A visitor can click on a topic and create a post for the person 
related to the topic. 
• 
 Activities : Summarizes the individual’s recent activities in the environment.  
• 
 Contact Information : Lists basic contact details for the person, including title, 
department, e-mail, phone, and office location. 
• 
 In Common : Identifies people the viewer has in common with the individual, such as 
shared managers, people both users follow, and so on. 
• 
 Org Chart : Displays where the individual fits in to the organization’s structure. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
469
 About Me Private View 
 The second About Me page view is the  private view , displayed when you view your own About Me page 
(see Figure  12-2 ). To navigate to this page, select the About Me option from the user menu at the top of the 
SharePoint pages. 
 Figure 12-1.  About Me shared view page 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
470
 This view provides some of the same details as the public view of the page, including the Ask Me About 
details and the user’s activities and contact information. However, your private view also has a link to the 
Edit Your Profile page. It brings you to the Edit Details page, where you can update your profile. The Edit 
Details page has five separate tabs to organize and manage profile information:
• 
 Basic Information : This tab lists general contact details, including a combination of 
items that are typically pulled from the Active Directory and other items that can be 
manually entered. Initially the following details can be managed:
• 
 About Me : Text describing the person and display on the About Me page.  
• 
 Picture : An image that can be uploaded and used to represent the person 
profiled both here and in other areas of SharePoint, such as newsfeeds and 
search results, containing references to the person. 
• 
 Ask Me About : Identifies topics in which the user has expertise. Viewers can 
request assistance from the person on these topics.

preferences for the individual, including these:
• 
 Followed #Tags : Identifies hash tags the person currently follows and allows 
these tags to be added and removed. 
• 
 Email Notifications : Identifies activities in the environment that cause an e-mail 
notification to be sent. 
• 
 People I Follow : Specifies whether to let other users see the people the 
individual is following. 
• 
 Activities I Want to Share in My Newsfeed : Identifies the types of activities to be 
listed in the person’s newsfeed when they occur. 
• 
 Language and Region : Allows management of language, time zone, and region 
preferences. By default, all details are inherited from the server, but they can be 
overridden as needed. Options managed in this section include these:
• 
 Language Preferences : Identifies the individual’s language choices in order of 
preference. Display language preferences and content and search language 
preferences can be configured. 
• 
 Time Zone : Identifies the individual’s default time zone.  
• 
 Region : Lists regional settings for the person, including local time and calendar 
format as well as workweek details.

 Alerts 
 Previous chapters discuss how SharePoint is used to store and manage documents and lists of information 
and how workflows and content organizer can act on this information to route content to other locations. 
We also discussed how search is used to locate content stored throughout the environment. All these 
capabilities enable SharePoint to host a wide variety of business resources. As the amount of information in 
the environment grows, it can become difficult to keep track of relevant information as it matures. 
 Alerts in SharePoint let you identify content that you want to be made aware of when it is added, 
changed, or deleting. Alerts are used to create e-mail or text message notifications for users when such 
identified actions occur. You can specify the type of changes an alert is to track and the frequency of 
notifications. You can create alerts for the following  items in SharePoint:
• 
 List Items or Documents : Enables notifications to be sent to identified individuals 
when changes are made to a specific document or list item.  
• 
 Lists or Libraries : Used to notify identified individuals of relevant changes to content 
in a specific list or library. 
• 
 Pages : Notifications are sent when the page content is changed.  
• 
 Search : Notifications are sent when items that satisfy a defined search query are 
changed. 
 Creating Alerts 
 When you  create  an alert, you define its characteristics, including the types of changes that will trigger the 
alert and its frequency of notification. Several types of changes can be identified that can trigger an alert to 
be sent. They are dependent on the type of object the alert is created for. When the alerts are configured, 
the frequency for receiving the alerts are also identified. There are several options available for determining 
when notifications are sent to the individuals the alert is configured for. The following frequencies can be 
defined for the various types of alerts.
• 
 Send Notification Immediately : Specifies that the alert notification is to be sent when 
the alert is triggered. This option is available for all types of alerts except search 
alerts. 
• 
 Send a Daily Summary : Specifies that all activities that trigger the alert are compiled 
into a daily summary report and sent to the identified individuals once a day at the 
time specified when the alert was created. 
• 
 Send Weekly Summary : Identifies that activities triggering the alert are compiled into 
a weekly summary report sent to the identified individuals once a week on a day and 
at a time specified when the alert was created. 
 You can create alerts anywhere in SharePoint where you have the Create Alerts right, which is available 
to users with at least Read rights to the materials. 
 
■ Note   Alerts can be created only in environments where a SharePoint technical administrator has 
configured outbound e-mail settings.

   Creating List Item and Document Alerts 
 Alerts created for a specific list item or  document send notifications for changes to that item. To create an 
alert for a specific list item or document, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library containing the item for which you want to create the 
alert. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, check the check box next to the list item or 
document to create the alert against, and choose the Set Alert on This Item/
Document option from the Alert Me drop-down menu on the Items/Files ribbon 
tab (see Figure  12-3 ). 
 
 3. 
 In the New Alert window, do the following:

to be alerted allowing them to include others. Other individuals can create 
alerts only for themselves in the site.  
 
 c. 
 In the Delivery Method section, specify whether to send the alert via e-mail 
or text message. The text message option is only selectable if a SharePoint 
technical administrator configures the environment for SMS (text 
messages). To send an alert via text message, specify the SMS number and 
whether to send the item’s URL as part of the message.  
 
 d. 
 In the Send Alerts for These Changes section, identify what changes to the 
item will trigger the alert. Options are as follows:

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
477
 Creating  Search Alerts  
 The discussion so far assumes you know the location of the content for which you want to configure alerts. 
Use a search alert when you are interested in creating an alert that spans several locations. You configure a 
search alert with a search query, so that you learn of changes to any content meeting the query, regardless 
of the content’s location. For example, if you are responsible for a certain client and need to learn of any 
activity related to materials referencing that client, create a search alert for a query of the client’s name. To 
create a new search alert, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Perform a search from the SharePoint search box or within a search page 
(searches are discussed in Chapter   11 ). 
 
 2. 
 On the search results page, select the Alert Me option at the bottom of the search 
results. 
 
 3. 
  On the New Alert page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Alert Title section, optionally update the default alert title (initially set 
to Search: followed by the query text entered).  
 
 b. 
 In the Delivery Method section, the e-mail option is selected. You cannot 
choose to send text message notifications for  search alerts  .  
 
 c. 
 In the Change Type section, specify what type of change will trigger the alert. 
Options are as follows:
• 
 New Items in Search Result : Triggers the alert when an item not previously 
included in the result set for the query is added. 
• 
 Existing Items Are Changed : Triggers the alert when an item already part of 
the result set for the query is edited. 
• 
 All Changes : Triggers the alert when a new item is added to the result set for 
the query or when items already part of the result set are edited. 
 
 d. 
 In the When to Send Alerts section, schedule when alert notifications are to 
be sent. Schedule options for search alerts include:
• 
 Send a Daily Summary 
• 
 Send a Weekly Summary 
 
 e. 
 Click the OK button. 
 The search alert is created, and you are returned to the search results page. 
 Working with Alerts 
 After you configure an alert or a site owner configures one for you, the changes associated with the alert will 
trigger it. Alert e-mails list changes to  con tent that caused the alert notification to be sent (see Figure  12-5 ). 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
478
 Alert  notifications include the following details:
• 
 Title identifying the item and type of change causing the alert.  
• 
 A link to navigate to the My Alert Settings page to manage alerts.  
• 
 A link to navigate to the item the alert was sent about.  
• 
 A link to navigate to the list or library containing the item. 
• 
 A link to the mobile view of the list or library containing the item.  
• 
 The list of the item’s properties, with changes to the properties indicated.     
 Managing Alerts 
 Alerts you create in a site (regardless of whether you create them for list items, documents, lists, libraries, 
pages, or searches) are all consolidated into a single  management screen for that site, called the My Alerts on 
This Site page (see Figure  12-6 ). 
 Figure 12-5.  Send an alert immediately e-mail

 Adding Alerts from the My Alerts on This Site Page 
 While viewing the My Alerts on This Site page, you can create new list and library alerts. To create an alert 
from this page, identify the list or library for which to create the alert, then configure the alert itself. To create 
a new alert from the My Alerts on This Site page, do the following:
 
 1. 
 On the My Alerts on This Site page, click the Add Alert link.  
 
 2. 
 On the New Alert page, select the list or library for which to create the new alert. 
Then click the Next button. 
 
 3. 
 On the second New Alert page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Alert Title section, optionally change the default alert title, which 
defaults to the name of the list or library.  
 
 b. 
 In the Send Alerts To section, site managers can update the default set 
of individuals to be alerted. Other individuals can create alerts only for 
themselves in the site. 
 
 c. 
 In the Delivery Method section, specify whether to send the alert via e-mail 
or text message. The text message option can only be selected if a SharePoint 
technical administrator has configured the environment for SMS (text 
messages). To send an alert via text message, specify the SMS number and 
whether to send the item’s URL as part of the message.  
 
 d. 
 In the Change Type section, specify what type of change to content in the list 
or library will trigger the alert. Options are as follows:
• 
 All Changes : Triggers the alert when existing content is updated in any way 
and when new items are added to the list or library. 
• 
 New Items Are Added : Triggers the alert only when a new item is added to 
the list or library. 
• 
 Existing Items Are Modified : Triggers the alert when an existing item in the 
list or library is edited. 
• 
 Items Are Deleted : Triggers the alert when an item in the list or library is 
deleted. 
 
 e. 
 In the Send Alerts for These Changes section, identify what types of changes 
to the item will trigger the alert. Options are as follows:
• 
 Anything Changes : Triggers the alert when any change is made to an item.  
• 
 Someone Else Changes an Item : Triggers the alert when someone other than 
the alerted user makes a change to an item.  
• 
 Someone Else Changes an Item Created by Me : Triggers the alert only for 
an item created by the alerted user and only when someone other than the 
alerted user makes a change to the item.  
• 
 Someone Else Changes an Item Last Modified by Me : Triggers the alert only 
for an item last modified by the alerted user and only when someone other 
than that user makes a change to the item.

 f. 
 In the When to Send Alerts section, identify how frequently to send the alert 
notifications. Select from these options (discussed earlier in this section):
• 
 Send Notification Immediately 
• 
 Send a Daily Summary 
• 
 Send a Weekly Summary 
 
 g. 
 Click the OK  button . 
 The new alert is created, and you are returned to the My Alerts on This Site page. 
 Following and Newsfeeds 
 You have seen how to use alerts to be notified via e-mail to changes made to items in lists and libraries. 
An alert works well when you want e-mail notifications for changes to content. However, as the volume of 
content requiring alerts grows, e-mail notifications can become difficult to track. Another way to stay abreast 
of activities is to follow resources in the environment. When you follow resources, changes to them and 
to activities related to them are posted to your newsfeed, where they are listed for review in chronological 
order. You can follow these items in SharePoint:
• 
 People : When you follow people in SharePoint, activities related to them are listed in 
your newsfeed. 
• 
 Documents : Changes to documents you follow are listed.  
• 
 Sites : When you follow a site, activity in the site feed is listed.  
• 
 Tags : Conversation items that reference followed tags are listed.    
 Following  People 
 You can track the activities of people you follow, such as those you work with, in your newsfeed. Here is how 
to start following someone:
 
 1. 
 Click on the name of the person you want to follow from any reference to the 
person in the site, such as from a list view of a document he or she created or last 
modified, from a discussion post, or from a reference in search results. 
 
 2. 
 On the About page for the person, click the Follow This Person link. 
 Your profile is updated to let you follow the person. If later you want to stop following the person,
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the person’s About page through any reference in a site.  
 
 2. 
 On the About page, select the Stop Following This Person link.     
 Your profile is updated so that you no longer follow the  person . 
 You can also view and manage items you follow from your newsfeed (newsfeeds are discussed in detail 
later in this chapter). 
 Following  Documents 
 You can choose to follow a document in your SharePoint environment and track changes made to it in your 
newsfeed. To follow a document, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the document to be followed. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
482
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, click the check box next to the document to be 
followed, and select the Follow option from the Files ribbon tab. 
 The document is added to your followed content, and changes to it are tracked in your newsfeed. You 
can also follow a document in a library by selecting the Follow option from the document’s hover panel in 
either library view or a search results list (see Figure  12-7 ). 
 As a later section explains, you can also stop following a document in the newsfeed.  
 Following Sites 
 In your environment you can follow sites and conversations taking place within them. When you follow a 
site, its newsfeed is rolled into your newsfeed for review. By default, sites you create are automatically added 
to the sites you follow. To follow other sites in SharePoint, click the Follow option at the top of the site’s page. 
 Followed  Sites Page  
 SharePoint includes a page that lists all the sites you are following and provides suggestions for other sites to 
follow, as Figure  12-8 shows. 
 Figure 12-7.  Document hover panel 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
483
 The Sites page provides easy access to any sites you are following throughout your SharePoint 
environment. From here you can navigate to any followed site by clicking on the site name or its URL. You 
can also stop following sites from the Sites page. Just click the Stop Following option associated with the 
listed site. 
 The Sites page also recommends sites for you to follow. This list is based on details about the site and its 
active participants. To follow a site in the Suggested Sites to Follow list, select the site’s Follow option.   
 Following Tags 
 Hash tags are used to categorize related content (overall management of hash tags is discussed in a later 
section). Here is how to follow a hash tag:
 
 1. 
 Click on a reference to the hash tag from a newsfeed. 
 
 2. 
 On the About page for the hash tag, click the Follow This #Tag link.     
 The  hash tag  is added to the items you are following. If later you want to stop following a tag, choose the 
Stop Following This #Tag link from the hash tag’s About page.

 Newsfeed 
 So far our discussion has centered on how to follow people, documents, sites, and hash tags to track 
activities related to them. Once you have selected items to follow in your environment, you can use the 
Newsfeed page to view tracked activities. Navigate to the Newsfeed page (see Figure  12-9 ) by clicking the 
Newsfeed link from the App Launcher. 
 The Newsfeed page initially lists all activities for followed items, with the most recent activities at 
the top. Each activity has a link to the items and people the activity is associated with. This page also 
summarizes the number of people, documents, sites, and tags you are following in the environment. Click 
on any of the listed totals to see items of that type you are following. From this details view page, you can 
navigate to any listed item. 
 People I’m Following 
 Available from the Newsfeed page by clicking on the count of people you follow, the People I’m Following 
page (see Figure  12-10 ) lists all of them. 
 Figure 12-9.  Newsfeed page 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES

 Click on the name of anyone listed on the page to navigate to his or her About page. If you open the 
hover menu for a listed individual, you can view all mentions of the person or all of his or her recent posts or 
you can choose to stop following the person. 
 Docs I’m Following 
 The Docs I’m Following page lists all documents you are currently following, as Figure  12-11 shows. 
 Click on the name of any listed item to open the associated file. You can also choose to stop following 
the item by clicking the Stop Following link listed with the item. The Docs I’m Following page also provides a 
list of suggestions for other documents you might want to follow. This list is based on your activities and how 
they relate to the materials in the environment. You can navigate to or follow any of these listed suggestions.

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
486
 Sites I’m Following 
 Clicking on the followed sites count in the Newsfeed page takes you to the Sites page. You can also get there 
by clicking on the Sites link at the top of any SharePoint page or from the App Launcher. (The Sites page is 
discussed earlier in this chapter.) 
 Tags I’m  Following  
 Clicking on the count for hash tags you follow on the Newsfeed page takes you to the #tags I’m Following 
page, as shown in Figure  12-12 . On the #tags I’m Following page, you can choose to stop following a listed 
tag by choosing the Stop Following link listed with the tag. You can also choose to follow additional tags by 
clicking the Follow More #tags link and then identifying the additional tags to follow.   
 Newsfeed Search 
 The Newsfeed page also includes a search that lets you view activities other than those you are following. 
This page enables you to view these additional sets of activities:
• 
 Everyone : Shows all recent activities available for you to review.  
• 
 Mentions : Lists activities in which you are mentioned.  
• 
 Activities : Shows all recent site activities. 
• 
 Likes : Shows recent activities related to items you have liked.    
 This page also allows you to create new posts to be listed in your activities.    
 Targeting 
 SharePoint includes a mechanism, called  targeting , used to restrict display of certain items, such as 
web parts and navigation links, to identified users or groups. Targeting, which is not the same as setting 
permissions, does not make content or pages unavailable. It simply hides web parts in pages and links 
within the navigation. When you target an element, you identify the users or groups to make the item visible 
for and thus surface details to specific users. For example, if you have a web part that lists sales by region, 
you may decide to list it on the home page of your portal but display it only to your sales teams. To do this, 
target the web part to the team so that it appears only when the group’s members visit the page. 
 Figure 12-12.    #tags I’m Following page       
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
487
 To target a web part or navigation item, do the  following  :
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Web Part Properties window to target the web part or to the item’s 
Edit window to target a navigation item. (Managing navigation and the properties 
of web parts are discussed in Chapters   3 and   4 , respectively.) 
 
 2. 
  On the Properties or Edit page, update details for the Audience option. Enter the 
targeted user or group, and then click the OK button.     
 Other items in SharePoint support targeting beyond web parts and navigation links, such as links in the 
Summary Links web part. Managing targeting for these other items is handled in the same way as managing 
targeting for web parts and navigation links in that you add the targeted users or groups in a Target 
Audiences selection area. 
 Sharing and Extending Content 
 SharePoint 2016 has several capabilities that provide the ability to easily share relevant information with 
others and add context to content in the environment by tagging, rating, and liking materials. 
 E-Mail a Link 
 One of the most basic ways to share information is to e-mail references to the information. Sending a 
reference to a list or library instead of attaching a copy of an item helps ensure that when the referenced 
materials are opened, the most recent version is viewed and edited. E-mailing someone a link instead of the 
file itself also helps protect documents from being accidentally shared with others if the e-mail is forwarded. 
You have the ability to  e-mail a link to a list or library to reference details you want to share. To e-mail a link 
to a list or library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library that you want to e-mail a link for.  
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the E-mail a Link option from the List or 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 In the opened e-mail message, identify the desired recipient and subject details, 
and then send the e-mail. 
 RSS Feeds 
 Another way people can share and consume content in SharePoint is through list and library RSS feeds. 
An RSS (Real Simple Syndication) feed enables access to a list’s or library’s contents from any RSS-enabled 
application, such as Outlook. Each list and library has an  RSS feed that can be accessed by doing the 
following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the RSS Feed option from the List or 
Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the RSS Feed page, click the Subscribe to This Feed link to subscribe to the 
feed using your default RSS feed application. 
 The RSS feed is connected to your RSS feed reader application.

 OneDrive 
 OneDrive can refer to different capabilities and services depending on the context. First, Microsoft hosts a 
cloud storage service called OneDrive, which is not directly related to our discussion. A second OneDrive is 
OneDrive for Business, which is a client tool installed as part of Microsoft Office that is used to synchronize 
content in SharePoint to local directories to support offline access. A third OneDrive is the OneDrive for 
Business available in Office 365 environments that can be linked to your SharePoint environment to use 
as the SharePoint OneDrive solution. The last OneDrive option, which is the one we are focusing on in 
this section, is the OneDrive for Business that is part of the SharePoint personal space. This OneDrive is a 
personal document library for storing private files in SharePoint and files you want to share with only select 
people. To access OneDrive for Business, click the OneDrive option from the App Launcher. This link takes 
you to the OneDrive for Business Documents library (see Figure  12-13 ). 
 The OneDrive for Business Documents library offers the same capabilities of other document libraries 
(described in Chapters   5  and   7 ), as well as some additional capabilities to make sharing files with others 
easier. The library has an integrated Sharing option listed next to each file and folder that lists the current 
shared states of the items. This option allows you to select individuals to share the file with and identify the 
level of access they have to the item. To share a listed file or folder, do the following:
 
 1. 
  From any page in the site, navigate to the OneDrive for Business Documents 
library by clicking the OneDrive option from the App Launcher.  
 
 2. 
  On the OneDrive for Business Documents page, click the Sharing option for the 
item to be shared.

 3. 
 In the Share window, click the Invite People option. 
 
 4. 
 In the Share window, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Select the individuals to share the item with. 
 
 b. 
 Select whether to give identified individuals Edit or View rights. 
 
 c. 
  Optionally include a message in the invitation going to the person.  
 
 d. 
 Optionally click the Show Options link to show the Send an Email Invitation 
option. Uncheck the option if you do not want to send an automated e-mail 
notification to individuals being given rights to the item.  
 
 e. 
 Click the Share  button . 
 The item’s security is updated to add the identified rights to the selected user. If you left the invitation 
option checked, an e-mail message is sent to the individuals notifying them of the resource’s availability. You 
are then returned to the Documents list view. 
 To manage permissions for items in the Documents library more granularly, select the Advanced option 
in the Shared With window. You are taken to the standard Permissions page for the library, where you can 
manage the item’s permissions (discussed in detail in Chapter   7 ). 
 
■ Note   Consider instituting a governance plan for the OneDrive for Business Documents libraries to keep 
these locations from becoming an overly used general storage tool. Your plan should address storage limits, 
usage guidelines, and retention management. 
 Enterprise Wikis 
 An Enterprise Wiki is a knowledge repository designed to let large audiences collectively mature information 
related to a topic. Its pages support the inclusion of references to other wiki pages to allow easy navigation 
between related pages. An  Enterprise Wiki site is configured to categorize pages into logical groupings and 
rate a page while it is being viewed (see Figure  12-14 ). A wiki site is used to collect team or community 
knowledge and make it more broadly available to those who need it. Collecting this knowledge captures 
information that typically resides only in people’s heads or in scattered notes and e-mails.  

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
490
 As wiki pages support entry of full rich text, you can develop pages containing text, images, and videos. 
You can also enter references to other pages directly into the page text by entering two pairs of brackets 
([[). When this is done, a list of available wiki pages appears in a context menu for the selection. You can 
reference a page in the listed context menu or make a reference to a page that has not yet been created. Do 
this by entering a title for a new page within double brackets; for example, [[My Page]]. After a page is saved 
that contains a reference to a page that does not exist, the first person to click on the page reference link is 
prompted to create a new page. If he or she accepts the prompt, the page is created, and the person is taken 
to it, where he or she can enter appropriate content. 
 Tags and Notes 
 Tags and notes provide context to content within SharePoint. Unlike hash tags, content tags allow 
categorization of content, and notes allow creation of commentary related to the content. Together they are 
used to add context to materials to support business efforts.

 c. 
 Close the Tags and Notes window once all tags and notes have been entered 
and  saved . 
 The Tags and Notes window is closed, and you are returned to the page from which you selected the 
Tags and Notes option. 
 Viewing Tags Through Tag Clouds 
 You can use the Tag Cloud web part to view tags associated with items in SharePoint. The listed tags are sized 
based on the number of items associated with the tag. The more items associated with the tag, the larger the 
tag text in the tag cloud will be. Click on any tag to get to the Tag Profile page, where all its associated items 
are listed (see Figure  12-15 ). 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
492
 The Tag Profile page lists items associated with the tag, along with a note board that can be used to 
create additional notes to be associated with the tag. 
 Rating Content 
 Content can be rated in SharePoint to allow users to identify the value or effectiveness of listed items. Ratings 
include presenting the average rating and the number of ratings made for the items listed (see Figure  12-16 ).

 Rating Content in a List or Library 
 To add a rating to an item in a list or library where ratings are enabled, click on the star representing the 
rating you want to apply to the item. This updates listed ratings by adding yours to the average and raises 
the number of ratings applied by one. If you rate an item a second time, the previous rating you gave it is 
updated instead of a new rating being added.

 Liking Content 
 “Liking” content is another way to rate it. You can indicate that you like list items, documents, comments, 
and posts. Liking content is an activity that is listed in newsfeeds for persons indicating they like the item, as 
well as in newsfeeds of those who follow the persons doing the liking. 
 Enabling Like for a List or Library 
 Liking is available by default for newsfeeds, but you must activate it for lists and libraries. To enable liking in 
a list or library, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the list or library where you want to enable liking. 
 
 2. 
 On the list or library view page, select the List or Library Settings option from the 
List or Library ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Rating Settings option from the General Settings 
section. 
 
 4.

 b. 
 Select Likes for the Which Voting/Rating Experience You Would Like to 
Enable for This List? option. 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button. 
 The ability to like content is added to the list or library.  
 Liking/Unliking Content 
 When the ability to like content is available, you can like an item by clicking the Like link associated with 
it. This increases the item’s number of likes and adds the activity to your newsfeed. To remove a previously 
applied like for an item, click the item’s Unlike option. 
 Building Communities 
 Communities are built by people who come together to address topics of common interest. Communities 
allow sharing and development of ideas and promote common objectives. SharePoint 2016 has many 
capabilities that support and foster community building. This section discusses these capabilities and how 
they are applied. 
 Site Newsfeeds 
 Newsfeeds in SharePoint sites give users a simple way to share information.  Site newsfeeds   are available by 
default in team sites. Site newsfeeds can be added to any other site by enabling the Site Feed site feature in 
that site. Site newsfeeds support many features found within standard microblogs.
• 
 The ability to share informational posts with other site users.  
• 
 The ability to reply to posts. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
495
• 
 The ability to target posts to individuals using @ references. To create an @ reference, 
enter an @ and then the user you want to target. Targeting a post to a specific 
individual adds the post to the person’s newsfeed. 
• 
 The hash tagging option make topics followable and shareable throughout the 
environment. Hash tags are discussed in detail in the next section. 
• 
 The inclusion of pictures that can be made part of the post.  
• 
 The ability to like posts. 
• 
 Following items so that activities in the site newsfeed can be surfaced within your 
personal newsfeed. 
 To add a post to a site newsfeed, enter its details into the Start a Conversation box to create a new main 
post in the newsfeed. To reply to an existing post, select the Reply option from the post and then enter the 
reply into the displayed Reply box. Finally, to add a picture to a post, click the camera icon displayed in a 
conversation or reply box, then select the image to be inserted. 
 Hash Tags 
 SharePoint 2016 supports the use of hash tags in newsfeeds and discussions. Hash tags, used to reference 
topics, posts or discussions, are objects that can be followed to track the topic’s activity. A  hash tag also 
has its own About page (see Figure  12-17 ) that lists conversations where the tag is referenced and allows 
identification of related tags. 
 To create a hash tag reference in a conversation or discussion in SharePoint 2016, enter the hash (#) and 
start typing. A context menu listing tags matching the entered text appears. Either select one of the listed tags 
or continue typing to create a new one. 
 
■ Note   A hash tag does not have spaces in its name. If you enter a space when referencing a hash tag in a 
post or discussion, the text typed after the space will not be part of the tag.

 Blogs 
 SharePoint  blogs allow for the creation and management of posts and allow those posts to be commented 
on. A blog is best described as a virtual press conference where a presenter publishes news, a discussion, or 
an article that can be reviewed. Consumers of the blog post can enter comments or questions, which in turn 
prompt additional comments or questions. Because blogs allow interaction on topics, many organizations 
use them as a tool to share news and announcements. 
 You can create blogs in SharePoint 2016 by creating a site based on the Blog site template. This template 
creates a new SharePoint blog site (see Figure  12-18 ). 
 Blogs consist of posts and comments. Unlike newsfeeds, which are designed for short comments and 
statements, blogs support full enhanced rich text, allowing inclusion of videos, images, and links. Blog posts 
can be short statements, like simple announcements, or lengthy articles full of details on an important topic. 
 Blog comments are short statements entered to provide context or clarity on the details in the blog or 
to question blog content. While blog comments cannot be replied to, follow-ups can be posted to listed 
comments and questions as new blog comments. Blog comments are organized chronologically and 
therefore appear in a discussion-like layout. 
 Blog posts can be organized into categories that structure and filter the posts in order to establish 
interrelationships and make locating relevant items easy.

 Managing  Blog Posts 
 A Blog Tools web part, listed on a blog’s home page, provides references to manage the main blog site 
capabilities. To create a blog post on a blog site, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the blog site, where you want to create a post.  
 
 2. 
 On the blog site home page, select the Create a Post option from the Blog Tools. 
 
 3. 
 On the New Post page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Enter a title for the new post. 
 
 b. 
 Optionally enter body text for the post. The body of the blog can include rich 
text details, including images and videos. 
 
 c. 
  Optionally identify categories the blog is to be associated with. Use of 
categories allows grouping of related posts. 
 
 d. 
 Identify the published date. The default is the current date and time, but this 
can be updated as necessary. 
 
 e. 
 Select the Publish button to publish the blog. 
 The new blog post is added to the blog. When a blog post is added to a blog site, the post includes 
options to do the following:
• 
 Comment on the post. 
• 
 Like the post. 
• 
 E-mail a link to the post to  others . 
• 
 Edit the post—that is, alter any of the details of the post you created.     
 Commenting on Posts 
 Comments can be added to published blog posts by clicking on the Comment link on the blog site home 
page or by clicking on the title of a post to navigate to the blog post page and then entering a comment in 
the Add a Comment box. Once a comment is posted, it becomes associated with the blog and listed below 
the post in chronological order. You can later edit your comment by clicking on the Edit link next to the 
comment and then editing the details presented on the Comment Edit page. 
 Managing Categories 
 Blog post categories are used to organize posts into related groupings. A single blog post can be associated 
with multiple categories. Blog posts are assigned to categories when the posts are added or edited. To 
manage blog categories, select the Manage Categories option from the Blog Tools. You are taken to the 
Categories list, where you can add, edit, and delete items (this is a standard SharePoint list; manage it as you 
would any other). Managing lists and list items is discussed in detail in Chapters   5 and   6 . 
 Using the  Blogging App 
 The blog site lets you link it with Microsoft Word’s blog post capabilities to allow creation of posts in Word. 
Clicking the Launch Blogging App link in the blog site’s Blog Tools opens Word and prompts you to configure 
the connection to the blog site (you must confirm the URL and verify your credentials). As Figure  12-19 
shows, Word’s blog posting tool is opened. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES

 This tool allows you to create blog posts in Word and then publish the posts on the blog site. You can connect 
to multiple blog sites from the Word blog posting tool and so can manage content on all of your blog sites.   
 Community Sites 
 Community sites let you organize discussions and other materials on specific topics. These sites are designed 
to consolidate knowledge and foster communication. To create a community site (see Figure  12-20 ), select the 
Community Site template when you create a new site.

 Community sites combine several SharePoint social capabilities designed to support and manage 
collaborative efforts. 
 Discussions 
 Community sites include a discussion list used to store and manage discussions in the community. 
Discussions are similar to newsfeeds in that items posted can be replied to and can be liked. Discussions are 
also similar to  blog posts in that the body of a discussion post can utilize full rich text, including images and 
videos. However, unlike both newsfeeds and blog posts, discussions have additional capabilities to facilitate 
the development of a dialogue, including the following:
• 
 Identifying Best Replies : Specific replies can be recognized as being the best answers 
or comments related to the discussion. 
• 
 Questions : Discussion posts can be flagged as questions. Items identified as 
questions do not simply comment or provide details on a topic but indicate to the 
community that an answer is being sought. 
• 
 Marked as Featured : A discussion marked featured is elevated in the community to a 
key position. 
 While discussion lists are by default found only in community sites, they can be added to other 
SharePoint site by adding a discussion list to the site and configuring it for use there. (Working with lists is 
discussed in detail in Chapters   5 and   6 .) 
 Figure 12-20.  Community  Site 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
500
 The discussion list in the community site includes several views to help organize community 
discussions. These  views include the following:
• 
 Recent : Discussions having the most recent activity are placed at the top.  
• 
 What’s Hot : The discussion order is based on popularity. 
• 
 My Discussions : Shows discussions started by the person viewing the list. 
• 
 Unanswered Questions : Lists discussions marked as questions but with no best reply 
selected. 
• 
 Answered Questions : Lists discussions marked as questions with a best reply selected. 
• 
 Featured : Identifies items or discussions flagged as featured. 
 Creating New Discussions 
 To  create  a new discussion in a discussion list, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the discussion list. For community sites, navigate to the community 
site’s home page, where the discussion is displayed.  
 
 2. 
 At the top of the discussion’s list view, click the New Discussion option.  
 
 3. 
 On the New Discussion page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 Enter a subject for the new discussion. 
 
 b. 
 Optionally enter the body details for the new discussion. The discussion 
body can include rich text, images, and videos.  
 
 c. 
  Identify whether the new discussion is a question.  
 
 d. 
 Identify the categories to associate with the new discussion.  
 
 e. 
 Click the Save button. 
 The new discussion is added to the discussion list. 
 Editing Discussions 
 To  edit existing discussions to change their details, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the discussion list management view. This is done by navigating to 
the discussion list and then choosing the Management View or in a community 
site by selecting the Manage Discussions option from the Community Tools. 
 
 2. 
 In the discussion view, choose the Edit Item option from the item’s context 
menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Edit Item page, make any necessary updates to the discussion and click 
the Save button. 
 The discussion is updated, and you are returned to the discussion list view. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
501
 Replying in a Discussion 
 By replying to discussions and to existing discussion replies, you create a hierarchy of communication. To 
reply to a post or an existing reply, click the Reply link for the item you want to reply to, enter the reply’s 
details, and click the Reply button. The reply is added to the discussion thread. 
 Marking a Best Reply 
 Identifying a reply in a discussion thread as the best reply not only flags the item as the best answer or 
comment but also lists it, together with the original post, at the top of the discussion and labels it best. There 
can be only one best reply for a discussion, so if you have already identified a best reply and then identify 
another, the new item will override the previous selection. You identify a best reply by selecting the Best 
Reply option from the associated reply’s context menu.  
 Deleting Posts and Replies 
 You can delete posts and replies from a discussion list. Deleting an item deletes all items associated with 
that item. If you delete the discussion’s main post, that post and all of its associated replies are deleted. If you 
delete a reply, the selected reply and any replies to the deleted reply are removed. To delete a post or a reply 
from a discussion list, select the Delete option from the item’s context menu, and then confirm that the item 
is to be deleted. 
 Managing Discussion  Categories  
 Selecting categories for discussions allow discussions to be grouped and organized by topic. You create and 
manage categories through the Categories list in the community site. To access this list, select the Create 
Categories option from the Community Tools. 
 Reputation 
 Community sites let you manage  reputations of community members. Reputation is calculated based on 
individuals’ activities in the site. Different activities (such as creating posts, replying to posts, having post or 
replies liked, having a reply marked the best) generate reputation points used to calculate reputations in the 
community site. 
 Managing Reputation Settings 
 Reputation is configured in the Reputation Settings page in a community site. These settings allow 
management of points received for various community activities and of thresholds and levels of reputation 
available. Reputation is managed as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the community site where you want to manage reputation. 
 
 2. 
 On the community site home page, select the Reputation Settings option from 
the Community Tools. 
 
 3. 
 On the Community Reputation Settings page, do the following:
 
 a. 
 In the Rating Settings section, identify whether items in the community 
discussion are to be rated and, if they are, whether to use likes or star ratings. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
502
 
 b. 
 In the Member Achievements Point System section, identify whether 
achievement points are to be managed and, if they are, how many points to 
grant for each of the following activities:
• 
 Creating a new post 
• 
  Replying to a post 
• 
  Member’s post or reply gets liked or receives a rating of 4 or 5 stars 
• 
  Member’s reply gets marked as “Best Reply”     
 
 c. 
 In the Achievement Level Points section, identify the number of points 
needed to reach each of the listed five achievement levels.  
 
 d. 
 In the Achievement Level Representation section, identify whether 
achievement levels are to be represented by a level image or by text-based 
titles. If by titles, then identify the titles for the levels. 
 
 e. 
 Click the OK button. 
 Once reputation settings are configured, site members’ reputations are subject to the thresholds.   
 Badges 
 Badges , like reputation, can be used to identify experts in a community. However, where reputation is 
calculated, community members are awarded badges by community managers. Before you award badges, 
you must create them. To create a badge in a community site, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the community site. 
 
 2. 
 On the community site home page, select the Create Badges option. 
 
 3. 
 On the Badges list page, add, edit, or delete badges as appropriate by direct list 
management (editing lists and list items is discussed in Chapters   5 and   6 ). 
 The badges are created. Once the badges are available, they can be assigned to community members as 
follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the community site where you want to assign badges.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Assign Badges to Members option from the 
Community Tools. 
 
 3. 
 On the Community Members page, click the check box next to a listed member, 
and then select the Give Badge option from the Moderation ribbon tab.  
 
 4. 
 On the Gifted Badges page, select the badge to give the user and click the Save 
button. 
 The badge is assigned to the member. 
 Top Contributors 
 Community sites track activities in them and track the  top contributors  . Members listed in the top 
contributors are based on the reputation users have developed in the community. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
503
 Managing Offensive Content 
 SharePoint community sites can be configured to allow site members to identify whether there is content 
that can be considered offensive in the site. To turn on  offensive content   monitoring, do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the community site. 
 
 2. 
 On the community site home page, select the Community Settings option from 
the Community Tools. 
 
 3. 
 On the Community Settings page, check the Enable Reporting of Offensive 
Content option from the Reporting of Offensive Content section and click the OK 
button. 
 The ability to report offensive content is added to the site. To identify a post or reply as offensive, select 
the Report to Moderator option from the item’s context menu. Then identify what the problem is with the 
item. Site managers can then view the items identified as offensive by selecting the Review Reported Posts 
option from the Community Tools. 
 Community Portals 
 The  Community Portal is a site collection that lists all community sites in your SharePoint farm to which you 
have rights (see Figure  12-21 ). 
 Figure 12-21.  Community Portal 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ PERSONALIZATION AND SOCIAL FEATURES
504
 The Community Portal helps people identify communities that they would like to join. In a Community 
Portal, you can view the list of communities organized by their popularity and search for communities 
to locate those of interest to you. Communities are listed in the portal with these details, which help you 
identify whether you want to join the community:
• 
 Member, discussion, and reply counts 
• 
 The most popular discussions in the list 
 When you identify a community you want to join, click on its name to navigate directly to it. The 
Community Portal also enables you to follow listed communities by selecting the Follow option from the 
hover panel for the communities. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, we discussed the personalization and social features available in SharePoint 2016. We 
reviewed the SharePoint profile and About Me pages and how they are used to maintain details about site 
users. We discussed alerts and following capabilities that help keep people aware of activities occurring 
in the environment. We then reviewed how to share links to information and store and manage personal 
content. Lastly, we discussed social sites, including wiki sites, blog sites, and community sites. 
 In the next chapter, we will review metrics and analytics available in SharePoint to help understand how 
resources are being used.

 CHAPTER 13  
 Metrics and Reporting 
 As your SharePoint environment matures and your use of it grows, the ability to understand how it is 
being used can give you valuable insight needed to enhance and extend the services being provided. In 
this chapter, the various types of metrics and reports in SharePoint are discussed. You can use them to 
understand resource usage and trends in your site collection. Within SharePoint are both broad, system-
level metrics available only to SharePoint technical administrators and specific site and site-collection 
metrics that your site collection and content administrators can view. This discussion focuses on the metrics 
and reports available to site collection and content administrators. 
 SharePoint uses a set of services that leverage the Analytics Processing Component. They use the 
SharePoint 2016 search services to support compilation and surfacing of managed metrics. 
 The metrics that are part of SharePoint can be organized into  three   categories:
• 
 Storage Metrics : Provide details of storage space usage in the environment. 
• 
 Usage Metrics : Present information on usage trends and volumes across content.  
• 
 Search Metrics : List search query statistics and analytics. 
 Storage Metrics 
 As the content managed in SharePoint increases, you should stay aware of the volume of information 
maintained and how it is distributed so you can identify sites requiring reorganization or lists and 
libraries whose content volumes call for enhancement through metadata-driven navigation or search 
tool configurations. Reviewing this information over time can help you understand content growth trends 
needed for capacity planning. 
 SharePoint  storage metrics provide detailed content volume metrics for review and analysis 
(see Figure  13-1 ). 

CHAPTER 13 ■ METRICS AND REPORTING
506
 The Storage Metrics report lists all objects in the site collection, including sites, lists, libraries, and 
documents. Click into any site, list, or library to view storage statistics for specific items and their content. To 
access storage metrics details, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection where you want to view storage 
statistics.  
 
 2. 
 On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Storage Metrics option from the Site 
Collection Administration section. 
 The Storage Metrics page that appears shows overall storage  usage   details for the sites, lists, and 
libraries located in the root site of the site collection. From here, you can click on the name of any listed item 
to show its details. Among the statistics presented as part of the storage metrics details are the following:
• 
 Total Size : Provides the sum, in megabytes (MB), for the listed object. When shown 
for a site, Total Size details reflect the total amount of space used by all list and library 
content stored in the site. When Total Size details refer to a list or library, they show 
the total amount of space used by the content stored in that list or library.  
• 
 % of Parent : Lists the percentage of the overall content used by the listed element in the 
level displayed. When you first access the Storage Metrics page, the figure shown reflects 
the overall percentage of space used by the site collection. As you navigate through the 
listed items, the figure will reflect the percent of space the elements use in the selected 
site, list, or library. For example, if you click on a site in the Storage Metrics page to 
see the storage details for items in that site, the figures you see will show the percent 
of storage used by each subsite, list, and library in the selected site. These details help 
identify the locations and items that use the most storage space in the environment.  
 Figure 13-1.     Storage metrics         
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ METRICS AND REPORTING
507
• 
 Last Modified : Identifies the date and time an item was last modified. This lets you 
see how recently information has been managed and helps identify sites, lists, and 
libraries whose lack of activity indicates that they may no longer be needed. 
 Site Collection Audit Reporting 
 You will recall that Chapter   9 discusses how to configure auditing for site collection resources such as 
specific lists, libraries, and content types in SharePoint. You can audit a variety of performable activities. 
Once auditing details are configured,  related activities are tracked. A set of reports allows you to review these 
activities (see Figure  13-2 ). 
 To access these  audit reports , do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection.  
 
 2. 
 In the root site, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
 On the Site Settings page, select the Audit Log Reports option from the Site 
Collection Administration section.

search usage details needed to understand usage trends in the environment. The reports open in Microsoft 
Excel. To run usage and search reports, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the root site in the site collection where you want to run the reports.  
 
 2. 
 On the root site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings 
menu.

 5. 
 In the Open or Save browser message window, click the Open button.     
 The selected report opens in Excel. 
 Usage Reports 
 Reports that can be run from the Usage Reports page fall into two categories. The first includes Usage 
reports, which provide general environment usage details. They are as follows:
• 
 Usage : A  Usage report lists general site collection usage statistics (see Figure  13-4 ), 
including details of daily and monthly usage traffic volume. Both of these report 
types list and graphically represent hit and unique user access totals. Hits are 
accesses made, regardless of who made them. Unique users are distinct individuals 
who accessed the resources. 
 Figure 13-3.  View Usage Reports page 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ METRICS AND REPORTING
511
• 
 Number of Queries : The Number of Queries report counts the search queries 
executed in the site collection by day and by month. Information appears in both 
tabular and chart format, in a layout similar to a Usage report’s. 
 Search Reports 
 The second report category on the View Usage Reports page is the Search Reports category. It includes 
statistics related to search queries executed in the site collection.
• 
 Top Queries by Day : Lists the most common search queries executed per day. The 
report file is organized as multiple Excel tabs, each tab listing the top query details 
for a day. This report shows the following details:
• 
 The result source of the query 
• 
 The actual query executed 
• 
 The total times the query was run within the day 
• 
 The percent of query executions the query represents 
 Figure 13-4.  Usage report 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ METRICS AND REPORTING
512
• 
 Top Queries by Month : Lists the most common search queries run per month. Like 
the Top Queries by Day report, the Top Queries by Month report is organized into 
multiple Excel tabs, each tab representing a single month. This report lists the 
following details for each listed query:
• 
 The result source of the query 
• 
 The actual query executed 
• 
 The total times the query was run within the month 
• 
 The percent of query executions the query represents 
• 
 Abandoned Queries by Day : Lists the most frequently executed queries where a result 
was not selected. With this report’s details you can identify queries that might require 
query rules or other search adjustments to help users locate desired results for the 
query. For example, if you notice people are running queries to find "tax bundles" 
and not getting appropriate results, you might create a query rule identifying a file 
type for tax bundles or a result source identifying where tax bundle materials are 
located. This report includes a tab for each day that lists queries run but for which no 
result was selected. Details listed for the queries include the following:
• 
 The result source of the query 
• 
 The actual query executed 
• 
 The total times the query was run within the day 
• 
 The percentage of times the query was run in the week without a result being 
clicked 
• 
 Abandoned Queries by Month : Provides the same details the Abandoned Queries by 
Day report does but has a tab per month with abandoned query totals for the given 
month. Details listed in the report include the following:
• 
 The result source of the query 
• 
 The actual query executed 
• 
 The total times the query was run within the month 
• 
 The percentage of times the query was run in the month without a result being 
clicked 
• 
 No Result Queries by Day : Lists queries executed for which no results were returned. 
Like the Abandoned Queries reports, this report can be used to identify queries that 
may need query rules or result sources defined. The No Result Queries by Day report 
lists the following details:
• 
 The result source of the query 
• 
 The actual query executed 
• 
 The total times the query was run within the day 
• 
 The percentage of times the query was run in the week with no results returned     

CHAPTER 13 ■ METRICS AND REPORTING
513
• 
 No Result Queries by Month : Lists queries executed each month for which no results 
were returned. This report, organized into a tab per month, lists the following details 
for the queries performed in the corresponding month for which no results were 
returned:
• 
 The result source of the query 
• 
 The actual query executed 
• 
 The total times the query was run within the month 
• 
 The percentage of times the query was run in the month with no results 
returned 
• 
 Query Rule Usage by Day : Lists query rules configured in the environment in order to 
show how many times rules were triggered by search queries each day. The statistics 
for each day appear on separate tabs in the report. The details for the query rules 
included in the report are the following:
• 
 The result source of the query 
• 
 The query rule 
• 
 The container (owner) in which the query rule is configured 
• 
 The type of object in which the query rule is configured  
• 
 The number of dictionary terms included 
• 
 The number of times the query rule was executed during the listed day  
• 
 The promoted result details configured as part of the query 
• 
 The number of times the promoted result item was clicked in the search results 
during the day 
• 
 The percentage of times the promoted result was clicked based on the number 
of times the query rule was executed during the day 
• 
 Query Rule Usage by Month : Gives details broken down by month of how many times 
executed search queries triggered rules configured in the environment. Monthly 
statistics, organized on separate Excel tabs, include the following:
• 
 The result source of the query 
• 
 The query rule 
• 
 The container (owner) in which the query rule is configured 
• 
 The type of object in which the query rule is configured  
• 
 The number of dictionary terms included 
• 
 The number of times the query rule was executed during the listed month 
• 
 The promoted result details configured as part of the query 
• 
 The number of times the promoted result item was clicked on the search results 
during the month

 Site Popularity Trends 
 Each site in a SharePoint Server environment is able to run a Popularity Trends report. This report summarizes 
access statistics, or popularity, for the site. The report contains details similar to those in a usage report for the 
site collection (discussed in an earlier section). As Figure  13-5  shows, the site usage report lists details, in both 
tabular and graphical format, of hits and unique user access by day and by month for a given site.  
 To access the Site Usage Details report for a desired site, do the following:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the site where you want to run the report. 
 
 2. 
  On the site’s home page, select the Site Settings option from the Settings menu. 
 
 3. 
  On the Site Settings page, select the Popularity Trends option from the Site 
Administration section.

 In the web browser Open or Save message box, click the Open button 
 The Usage Details report for the site opens in Excel. It lists overall site access details broken down by day 
and by month. For each of the days and months listed, hit and unique user summary details are provided. 
 Library Most Popular Items 
 Since SharePoint tracks usage of  items in libraries, it gives you the ability to understand which resources are 
accessed most often. To view usage details for a library, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to view usage details. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Most Popular Items option from the Library 
ribbon tab. 
 You are brought to the Most Popular Items page for the selected library (see Figure  13-6 ). 
 This page lists the items contained in the library and sorts them by placing the most recently accessed 
materials at the top of the list. You can organize the information for viewing in any of three different content 
access groupings:
 Figure 13-6.  Most Popular Items details 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ METRICS AND REPORTING
516
• 
 Most Views : The default option; items are ordered by most to least viewed. This view 
has two separate statistics. The first lists the number of recent views, and the second 
lists the total number of views. 
• 
 Most Views by Unique Users : Lists recent and overall view counts based on access to 
the item by unique individuals. 
• 
 Most Recommendation Clicks : Lists items with both recent and overall access based 
on the items’ usage patterns. 
 You can filter information displayed in the Most Popular Items views based on search criteria entered 
in the page’s search box. You can also directly open a listed item’s Usage report by clicking on the Popularity 
Trends link accompanying the item. 
 Document Popularity Trends 
 You can view Usage reports for individual documents in SharePoint to understand a specific item’s access 
trends. An item’s usage details summarize access to the document over time, including both overall hit 
details and unique user accesses. As is true of many of the Usage reports described earlier, the document 
usage details are presented as an Excel-based report showing both daily and monthly access summaries for 
the item (see Figure  13-7 ).

 CHAPTER 14  
 Enterprise Office Services 
 SharePoint has a set of services that expand the capabilities of Microsoft Office and extend these personal 
productivity tools to enhance team productivity. The following enterprise office services in SharePoint 
enhance Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, InfoPath, and Visio.
• 
 Office Online Server : Web-based version of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote 
allowing for web-based management of Office files providing document view and 
edit capabilities without Office being locally installed. 
• 
 Form Services : Publishes InfoPath forms rendering them as web forms that can be 
populated without r InfoPath being installed. 
• 
 Visio Services : Allows Visio diagrams to be accessed via the browser for viewing and 
commenting without Visio being installed.    
 All of these enterprise office services are designed to expand the capabilities of Microsoft Office. Making 
Office resources available through the web browser extends their reach and availability without the need to 
manage the programs. In this chapter each of these services is discussed, and how they are configured and 
used is described. 
 Office Online Server 
 Office Online Server is the most recent release of the web-based versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote. The previous version of this product was called Office Web Apps. Office Online 
Server is installed separately from core SharePoint services but is then leveraged by SharePoint to allow web-
based editing and viewing  of  Office files. There are three common scenarios in which Office Online Server 
provides significant value.
• 
 When you need to work with Microsoft Office documents on a device that does 
not have Microsoft Office installed. While this may be uncommon on standard 
workstations, it is often the case on alternative devices, such as tablets. 
• 
 When you need to take advantage of simultaneous document editing.  
• 
 When you want document previews available when searching for or browsing 
Microsoft Office documents. 
 
■ Note   To take  advantage of Office Online Server, the services must be deployed and configured by a 
SharePoint technical administrator. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES

 Opening  Files in Office Online Server 
 When Office Online Server is available in SharePoint you can choose whether to open a Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, or OneNote file in the associated Microsoft Office program or in the browser. To open a 
document in Office Online server, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library containing the document to be opened. 
 
 2. 
 Select the Open in Word Online, Excel Online, PowerPoint Online, or OneNote 
Online option from the hover panel menu (see Figure  14-1 ). 
 The document opens in the web version of the Office program. Web-based versions of Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote look much like the full versions (see Figure  14-2 ).

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
522
 While working with documents in the Online version of the Office program, you can work with and 
make changes to documents as needed. Select the Open In option on the ribbon tab row to open the file in 
the local version of the associated program when it is loaded on a local computer.  
 Managing Default Open Behavior 
 While site users can open a file in the online version of the Office program, a manager of a library can set 
the default behavior of a library when opening. You can choose to either open the file in the online or local 
versions of Office. To set the  default document opening behavior for Office files, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the library where you want to set the default opening behavior. 
 
 2. 
 On the library view page, select the Library Settings option from the Library 
ribbon tab.  
 
 3. 
 On the Settings page, select the Advanced Settings option from the General 
Settings section. 
 
 4. 
 On the Advanced Settings page in the Opening Documents in the Browser 
section, set the Default Open Behavior for Browser-Enabled Documents as 
needed:
• 
 Select Open in Client Application to open the files in the local Office version. 
• 
 Select Open in the Browser to open the file in the Online version of the program. 
• 
 Select Use the Server Default option to inherit the open behavior from the site 
collection settings.

 The document library will be configured so that when the Edit option is selected, the document will be 
opened using the selected approach. 
 Publishing Excel  Elements 
 Previous versions of SharePoint included a service called  Excel Services . Excel Services allowed for Excel 
components to be published for display within SharePoint using Excel Services web parts in SharePoint 
pages. In SharePoint 2016, Excel Services has been removed but the capabilities provided have been 
incorporated into Office Online Server. With Office Online Server in place, Excel documents can be 
published in whole or in part for sharing within SharePoint site pages. You can publish the following 
elements of an Excel document:
• 
 An entire Excel workbook 
• 
 A sheet within an Excel workbook 
• 
 A specific object within a sheet, such as a PivotTable or pie chart  
• 
 A named range of cells in a sheet 
 While these capabilities do not allow editing of cells in published views, you can configure named cells 
to be updated through parameters added to the Excel Services view or passed into the Excel Services views. 
 Creating Named Cells for  Parameters 
 When Excel elements are published, such as, charts or calculations that require input from the user viewing 
the item or input passed in via a filter or connected web part, the Excel document must be configured to 
allow parameter management. To add named cells to support parameters in either Excel 2013 or Excel 2016, 
do as follows:
 
 1. 
 Open the document in Microsoft Excel. 
 
 2. 
 In Excel, highlight the cell to be updated by the parameter.  
 
 3. 
 Type a name for the cell in the Name box to the left of the formula bar. 
 With the cell named, it can be configured to have values passed in via a parameter. 
 Creating a Named Range 
 As just mentioned, named  ranges in Excel can be published. You can publish a select group of cells in a sheet 
without having to show the entire sheet or workbook. Create a named range by highlighting the cells to be 
included, and then type a name for the range in the Name box. 
 Publishing an  Excel Sheet 
 Once the content to be published is configured and parameter names and named ranges are added, you can 
publish it to Excel Services. The approach for publishing content from Excel 2016 or 2013 is done as follows:
 
 1. 
 In Excel, select the File ribbon tab. 
 
 2. 
 On the File menu, select the Save As option. 
 
 3. 
 In the Save As section, select the save location.  

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
524
 
 4. 
 In the Save As window, click the Browser View Options button (see Figure  14-3 ). 
 
 5. 
 In the Browser View Options window, do the following:
 
 a. 
  On the Show tab, select the item to publish. Options include:
• 
 Entire workbook 
• 
 Sheets (requires selecting the sheets to be published) 
• 
 Items in the workbook (requires selecting the PivotTables, charts, and 
named ranges to be published) 
 
 b. 
 On the Parameters tab, add any parameters identifying editable cells. This is 
done as follows:
 
 i. 
 Click the Add button. 
 
 ii. 
 In the Add Parameters window, click the box next to the parameter cells 
to be included and click the OK button.      
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button. 
 
 6. 
 Click the Save button in the Save As window to save the file to SharePoint. 
 The file is saved to SharePoint, and the identified resources are published.   
 Figure 14-3.  Excel Save As window 
 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
525
 Viewing Excel Published Content 
 Once items are published, they can be viewed in the library where the file is saved and through web parts 
added to SharePoint pages. To view Excel published  content in the library containing the file, select the 
View in Browser option from the document’s hover panel menu. Selecting this option opens the published 
content and gives you access to all of the published views that were created, as Figure  14-4 shows. 
 The view of the Excel Services published file includes the following options:
• 
 Filters : Lists filters configured for the published content that can be used to filter the 
information presented. 
• 
 Options : Provides management options available when viewing a file published with 
Excel Services. The options available, which depend on the rights of the individual 
viewing the information, include the following:
• 
 Save a Copy : Lets you save a copy of the workbook under a different name.  
• 
 Download : Initiates a download of a copy of the file to be saved locally.  
• 
 Print : Lets you print the full workbook or the item being viewed. 
• 
 Share with People : Brings you to the Sharing window for the document in the 
library. 
• 
 Find : Allows content searching in the current view.  
• 
 Refresh All Data : Reloads the information in the sheet.  
• 
 Calculate Workbook : Reruns the calculations used in the document.     
• 
 Do More : Provides additional management options available to you in the workbook. 
Options provided in this section, which depend on the rights of the user viewing the 
item, may include:
 Figure 14-4.  Excel Services published content 
 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
526
• 
 Edit in Excel : Opens the item in the locally installed copy of Excel. 
• 
 Edit in Excel Online : Opens the document in the Excel web application.       
 The view of the Excel published content also includes a listing of all of the published components in the 
file. This information is listed in the View section, and items can be selected to update the display that shows 
the selected published component. 
 Using the Excel Web Access Web Part 
 Excel published content can be displayed on SharePoint pages with the Excel  Web Access web part , which 
can be configured to display a specific published item in an Excel document that has been published. To use 
the Excel Web Access web part, add it to a web part, wiki, or publishing page, and configure it to display the 
appropriate published item (working with pages and web parts is discussed in Chapter   4 ). 
 When configuring the Excel web access web part, the following options are available:
• 
 Workbook Display
• 
 Workbook : Identifies the Excel document that is the source for the content to be 
displayed in the web part. Browse to the item by clicking the ellipse button, or 
enter the path directly into the box. 
• 
 Named Item : Identifies the element to be displayed. If this option is left blank, 
the web part shows the workbook. You can enter a sheet or object name that has 
been published. 
• 
 Toolbar and Title Bar
• 
 Autogenerate Web Part Title : Identifies whether to automatically generate the 
web part title or manually type it in the Title field of the web part. 
• 
 Autogenerate Web Part Title URL : Identifies whether to automatically configure 
the URL used when clicking on the title of the web part.  
• 
 Type of Toolbar : Determines the configuration of the toolbar appearing at the 
top of the web part. 
• 
 Toolbar Menu Commands : Allows identification of the commands to make 
available in the Toolbar menu of the web part. 
• 
 Navigation and Interactivity
• 
 Navigation : Identifies whether to include hyperlinks for navigation.  
• 
 Interactivity : Identifies the types of activities to allow with the published item 
being displayed. 
 Once the Excel Web Access web part is added to a page and configured, it shows the identified Excel 
Services published content, which can be combined with other Excel Web Access web parts, reporting web 
parts, images, and the like to create a dashboard or scorecard page used to relay important analytics.   
 Form Services 
 One of the programs previously available as part of Microsoft Office was InfoPath.  InfoPath 2013   has since 
been made freely available for download and install. There is no 2016 version of this program. However, 
the 2013 version can be used in conjunction with SharePoint 2016. InfoPath is used to create forms to 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
527
collect information. You can create InfoPath forms that contain information for managing such processes 
as employee time-off requests or sales staff expense management. The forms can contain logic needed to 
ensure that information collected is accurate and complete. When InfoPath forms are used independent of 
SharePoint, people that need to fill out the form must have InfoPath installed on a local computer and must 
also have the most current copy of the form template used when the instances of the form are created. These 
requirements add management overhead and can result in use of the wrong templates or can keep people 
from participating in the process if they do not have the appropriate version of InfoPath. 
 SharePoint’s Form Services, available in  SharePoint Server Enterprise  , is used in conjunction with Form 
libraries, which let you publish InfoPath form templates to SharePoint and render them as web forms. Since 
the form templates are managed in SharePoint, you can be certain that newly generated forms are based on 
the correct and most current template. Since the forms are rendered in the web browser, you ensure that all 
users who need access to the form get it, regardless of whether they have InfoPath on their local computer. 
 Creating Forms and Form Libraries 
 To create a new InfoPath form and publish it to a  form library   for use with Form Services, do the following:
 
 1. 
 Create a new SharePoint Form Library project and add needed fields, layouts, 
and business logic. 
 
 2. 
 On the InfoPath File tab, select the Publish option. 
 
 3. 
 On the Publish page click, the SharePoint Server option.  
 
 4. 
 If the form is not yet saved locally, save it when prompted, and identify a save 
location. (Any accessible location will do. It has no direct relationship to the form 
library or template where the item is published.) 
 
 5. 
 In the first Publishing Wizard window, enter the URL for the SharePoint site 
where the form is to be created and click the Next button.  
 
 6. 
 In the second Publishing Wizard window, do the following:
 
 a. 
  Verify that the Enable This Form To Be Filled Out By Using a Browser option 
is clicked. 
 
 b. 
 Select the Form Library option. 
 
 c. 
 Click the Next button to continue the publishing process. 
 
 7. 
 In the third Publishing Wizard window, either create a new form library in the 
specified site or select an existing form library to update the form template 
within. Then click the Next button. 
 
 8. 
 If you chose to create a new form library, in the fourth Publishing Wizard 
window, enter a name for the new form library and an optional description. 
Then click the Next button. 
 
 9. 
 On the fifth Publishing Wizard screen, identify fields from the form to include as 
columns in the library and to use as parameters for creating connections with 
other web parts for filtering purposes. Then click the Next button. 
 
 10. 
 On the sixth Publishing Wizard page, click the Publish button. This will perform 
the publishing of the form. 
 
 11. 
 In the Publish Confirmation window, click the Close button.     
 A new form library is created. It uses the created InfoPath form as the template when new items are 
created in the library. The form will be rendered through the web browser. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
528
 Populating Forms 
 Once a  form  is published as the template for a form library, site users can create new instances of the form, 
populate the details, and submit the completed form to the library. This completed form can be reviewed 
or can initiate a workflow process to further mature the collected information or pass it through an approval 
process. (Creating and managing workflows is discussed in Chapter   9 .) 
 To create a new instance of a form managed through a form library, do the following:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the form library. 
 
 2. 
 In the library view, click the New option, or select the New Document option 
from the Files ribbon tab. 
 
 3. 
  Fill out the presented form. Once you are done, click the Submit button, if it is 
available, or the Save option (see Figure  14-5 ). 
 When populating a form through Form Services, the following form management options are available:
• 
 Submit : Available only if the form was configured with a Submit option. If available 
and selected, the Submit option saves the form in the library and runs any workflows 
associated with the form. 
• 
 Save : Saves the form to the form library. This option differs from Submit in that 
here you can save a partly completed form and submit it when you have finished 
populating it. 
 Figure 14-5.  InfoPath form in Form Services 
 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
529
• 
 Save As : Saves the opened form under a new name in the form library. 
• 
 Close : Closes the form without saving any changes made.  
• 
 Paste : Pastes the clipboard content into the currently selected field. 
• 
 Copy : Copies highlighted content to the clipboard. 
• 
 Cut : Copies highlighted content to the clipboard and removes it from the field. 
• 
 Print Preview : Opens a printable view of the form.     
 Using the InfoPath Form Web Part 
 Published forms can be presented in a web part and added to pages in SharePoint. That is, you can place 
the entry form on the same page as other resources(for example, when using a form to collect survey-like 
information related to page content). To use the InfoPath Form web part, add it to the appropriate page and 
configure it to render the desired form in SharePoint. The configuration options in the  InfoPath Form web 
part are as follows:
• 
 List or Library : Selects the form library with the form template to be used. 
• 
 Content Type : Selects the content type used for display in the form library. 
• 
 Show InfoPath Ribbon on Toolbar : Identifies whether to display the InfoPath ribbon 
option when the page is viewed. 
• 
 Send Data to Connected Web Parts when Page Loads : Specifies whether to send form 
information to a connected web part when the SharePoint page loads. 
• 
 Views : Selects the default form view to be displayed on the page. 
• 
 Submit Behavior : Specifies form behavior when the Submit option is selected. 
 Visio Services 
 Visio Services renders Visio files stored in SharePoint Server Enterprise through the web browser. Thus, 
you can view those diagrams without having Visio on a  local computer . This is useful when people without 
access to Visio need to view Visio diagrams or when the Visio diagram needs to be placed on a page with 
related components and information. 
 To publish a Visio diagram through  Visio Services , save the file to a SharePoint document library as 
a Visio Web Drawing ( .vdw ) file, if you use Visio 2010, or as a Visio 2013 or Visio 2016 ( .vsdx ) file. Once 
saved to one of these formats in a document library, you can view the file in the  web browser   through Visio 
Services by selecting the View in Web Browser option from the document’s hover panel menu. This opens 
the document in the browser (see Figure  14-6 ). 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
530
 When you  view a Visio diagram through Visio Services, the following options are available to support 
users accessing the file:
• 
 Open in Visio : An option present when Visio is available to open the file. Selecting it 
opens the file in the locally installed Visio program. 
• 
 Refresh : Reloads the diagram in the view. 
• 
 Shape Info : Allows you to view the details of the listed shape. 
• 
 Comments : Available only when viewing a VSDX file, this option lets you create and 
place comments on objects in the diagram. To create a comment, select the object. 
Then click the Comments option to enter the comment.    
 As discussed with Form Services, Visio Services also includes a web part that displays Visio Services 
published files in SharePoint pages. The Visio Web Access web part displays a selected Visio diagram on 
a page. This  web part is configured through management of the following web part properties when it has 
been added to a page:
• 
 Web Drawing URL : Allows for selection of the Visio diagram file, either a  .vdw 
or  .vsdx file, to be displayed. Browse to a file by selecting the ellipse button and 
choosing the file from the Select an Asset window. 
• 
 Force Raster Rendering : Applying only to  .vdw files, identifies whether to use raster 
rendering with the file. 
• 
 Automatic Refresh Interval : Defines the schedule in which to refresh the web part 
data.

CHAPTER 14 ■ ENTERPRISE OFFICE SERVICES
531
• 
 Fit All Shapes in View : Identifies whether to size the diagram to fit into the view. 
• 
 Index of the Initial Page to Show : Identifies the page in the diagram to be presented 
initially. 
• 
 Expose the Following Shape Data Items to Web Part Connections : Specifies the shapes 
in the diagram whose data can be used in connections to other web parts. 
• 
 Toolbar and User Interface : Identifies the toolbars to be included in the diagram 
view. The following options are available for selection:
• 
 Show Refresh: Reloads the diagram in the web part. 
• 
 Show Open in Visio: When selected, opens the diagram in the locally installed 
Visio program. 
• 
 Show Page Navigation: Lists selectable pages in the diagram.  
• 
 Show Status Bar: Presents the diagram status bar.  
• 
 Show Shape Information Pane: Allows viewing of selected shape details. 
• 
 Show Default Background: Identifies whether to use the default background 
when presenting the diagram. 
• 
 Web Drawing Interactivity : Lets you disable interactivity capabilities available to 
users viewing the diagram. The options include:
• 
 Disable Zoom: Allows zooming in and out of the diagram. 
• 
 Disable Pan: Allows panning the diagram. 
• 
 Disable Hyperlink: Identifies whether hyperlinks are to be available.  
• 
 Disable Selection: Identifies whether objects can be selected. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter we reviewed the Enterprise Office Services available within SharePoint 2016. We discussed 
Office Online Server and how it integrates with SharePoint 2016 providing web-based versions of Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. We then reviewed Form Services discussing how InfoPath Server can be 
published as web forms within SharePoint. Lastly we discussed Visio Services and how Visio diagrams can 
be published to SharePoint for display within SharePoint pages.
