Preface
Preface
The present book is used for lecture courses Computational heat and mass
transfer, Mathematical models of turbulence and Design of special cloth given
by the authors at the University of Rostock, Germany and Don State Tech-
nical University, Russia. Each of lecture courses contains about 14 lectures.
The lecture course Compuational heat and mass transfer was written pro-
ceeding from the idea to present the complex material as easy as possible.
We considered derivation of numerical methods, particularly of the ﬁnite vol-
ume method, in details up to ﬁnal expressions which can be programmed.
Turbulence is a big and a very complicated topic which is diﬃcult to cover
within 14 lectures.
We selected the material combining the main physi-
cal concepts of the turbulence with basic mathematical models necessary to
solve practical engineering problems. The course Design of special cloth uses
the material of two parts of this book partially. The material for the third
part was gathered from research projects done by the authors of this book
within some industrial projects and research works supported by diﬀerent
foundations. We express our gratitude to Andreas Gross, Gunnar Jacobi
and Stefan Knochenhauer who carried out CFD calculations for the third
part of this book.

Continuity equation
We consider the case of uniform density distribution  D const. The con-
tinuity equation has the following physical meaning: The amount of liquid
ﬂowing into the volume U with the surface S is equal to the amount of liquid
ﬂowing out. Mathematically it can be expressed in form:

Since the integration volume U is arbitrary, the integral is zero only if

Let  E

relations for the gravitational forces:
 E

(1.5)
where  E
f is the gravitational force acting on a particle with volume U . The
strength of the gravitational force is equal to the gravitational acceleration:

The body forces are acting at each point of ﬂuid in the whole domain.
1.1.2.2
Surface forces
The surface forces are acting at each point at the boundary of the ﬂuid
element. Usually they are shear and normal stresses. The strength of surface
forces is determined as

Main equations of the Computational 
Heat and Mass Transfer
The full or material substantial derivative of the velocity vector d Eu

acceleration of the ﬂuid particle. It consists of two parts: local acceleration
and convective acceleration:

convective acceleration
The local acceleration is due to the change of the velocity in time.
The
convective acceleration is due to particle motion in a nonuniform velocity
ﬁeld. The Navier-Stokes Equation in tensor form is:

The Navier Stokes equation together with the continuity equation (1.3) is
the closed system of partial diﬀerential equations. Four unknowns velocity
components ux; uy; uz and pressure p are found from four equations. The
equation due to presence of the term
@
@xj .uiuj/ is nonlinear.
The boundary conditions are enforced for velocity components and pressure
at the boundary of the computational domain. The no slip condition ux D
uy D uz D 0 is enforced at the solid body boundary. The boundary condition
for the pressure at the body surface can directly be derived from the Navier
Stokes equation. For instance, if y D 0 corresponds to the wall, the Navier
Stokes Equation takes the form at the boundary:

Main equations of the Computational

Very often the last term in the last formulae is neglected because second
spatial derivatives of the velocity are not known at the wall boundary.
Till now, the existence of the solution of Navier Stokes has been not proven by
mathematicians. Also, it is not clear whether the solution is smooth or allows
singularity. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called the Navier–Stokes
existence and smoothness problems one of the seven most important open
problems in mathematics and has oﬀered one million dollar prize for its
solution.

Heat conduction equation
Let q.x; t/ be the heat ﬂux vector, U is the volume of ﬂuid or solid body, S is
its surface and n is the unit normal vector to S. Flux of the inner energy
into the volume U at any point x 2 U is

Finite dierence method

Finite diﬀerence method
2.1
One dimensional case
Let us consider the ﬁnite diﬀerence method for the one dimensional case.
Let '.x/ is the function deﬁned in the range Œ0; a along the x axis. The
section Œ0; a is subdivided in a set of points xi. For the homogeneous distri-
bution xi D .i  1/I i D 1; N,  D a=.N  1/ (see Fig. 2.1).
Figure 2.1: One dimensional case.
Let us approximate the derivative @'

(2.6)
The accuracy of BDS, FDS and CDS can be improved using the polynomial
representation of the function '.x/. For instance, consider the approximation
'.x/ D ax2 C bx C c
within the section Œxi1; xiC1.
Without loss of generality we assume xi1 D 0. The coeﬃcient c can be
obtained from the condition:
'.0/ D 'i1 D c
Other two coeﬃcients a and b are determined from the conditions:
'i D ax2 C bx C 'i1
'iC1 D a4x2 C b2x C 'i1

chapter we consider uniform two dimensional grids .xi; yj/ with equal spacing
in both x and y directions.

Time derivatives. Explicit versus implicit
Let the unsteady partial diﬀerential equation is written in the form:
@g
@t D G.g; t/
(2.15)
The solution is known at the time instant n. The task is to ﬁnd the solution
at n C 1 time instant. Using forward diﬀerence scheme we get:
gnC1 D gn C G.g; t/t
(2.16)
Taking the r.h.s. of (2.15) from the n  th time slice we obtain:
gnC1 D gn C G.gn; t/t
(2.17)
The scheme (2.17) is the so called explicit scheme (simple Euler approach).
Taking the r.h.s. of (2.15) from the n C 1  th time slice we obtain:
gnC1 D gn C G.gnC1; t/t
(2.18)
The scheme (2.18) is the implicit scheme. The r.h.s. side of (2.18) depends on
the solution gnC1. With the other words, the solution at the time slice nC1,
gnC1 can not be expressed explicitly through the solutions known the from
previous time slices 1; 2; ::; n for nonlinear dependence G.g; t/.
Mix between explicit and implicit schemes is called the Crank-Nicolson Scheme:

Stability and articial viscosity of numerical methods
As follows from the last formula,the perturbation decays if
c < 1
(3.14)
The condition (3.14) is the Courant Friedrich Levy criterion of the stability
of explicit numerical schemes. If the velocity is changed within the compu-
tational domain, the maximum velocity umax is taken instead of u in for-
mula (3.14). Physically the condition umaxt
x
< 1 means that the maximum
displacement of the ﬂuid particle within the time step Œt; t C t does not
exceed the cell size x. The CFL parameter c can be reduced by decrease
of t (not by increase of x!).

criterion.

Mixed schemes
The high accuracy of the CDS schemes is their advantage. The disadvantage
of CDS schemes is their instability resulting in oscillating solutions. On the
contrary, the upwind diﬀerence schemes UDS possess a low accuracy and high
stability. The idea to use the combination of CDS and UDS to strengthen
their advantages and diminish their disadvantages. Let us consider a simple
transport equation for the quantity ':

Staggered grid
The grids are subdivided into collocated and staggered ones.
On collo-
cated grids the unknown quantities are stored at centres of cells (points P in
Fig. 4.1). The equations are also satisﬁed at cell centres. For the simplicity,
we considered the case x and y are constant in the whole computational
domain. Use of collocated grids meets the problem of decoupling between
the velocity and pressure ﬁelds. Let us consider the Poisson equation (4.6)
with the r.h.s.

Simple explicit time advance scheme for 
solution of the Navier Stokes Equation
This equation (4.11) has involves nodes which are 2 apart (see also [3])!
It is a discretized Poisson equation on a grid twice as coarse as the basic
one but the equations split into four unconnected systems, one with i and j
both even, one with i even and j odd, one with i odd and j even, and
one with both odd. Each of these systems gives a diﬀerent solution. For
a ﬂow with a uniform pressure ﬁeld, the checkerboard pressure distribution
shown in Fig. 4.2 satisﬁes these equations and could be produced. However,
the pressure gradient is not aﬀected and the velocity ﬁeld may be smooth.

There is also the possibility that one may not be able to obtain a converged
steady-state solution.
A possible solution of the problem is the application of the staggered grids
(Fig. 4.3). The Poisson equation is satisﬁed at cell centres designated by
crosses.
The ux velocities are stored at points staggered by x=2 in x-
direction (ﬁlled circles). At these points the ﬁrst Navier- Stokes equation is
satisﬁed:

The approximation of the convective term is a very critical point. For faster
ﬂows or larger time steps, the discretization shall be closer to an upwinding
approach [4]. Following to [4] we implement a smooth transition between
centered diﬀerencing and upwinding using a parameter  2 Œ0; 1. It is deﬁned
as
 D min.1:2  t  max.jux.i; j/j; juy.i; j/j/; 1/
(4.14)
The value of gamma is the maximum fraction of a cells which information can
travel in one time step, multiplied by 1:2, and capped by 1. The factor of 1:2
is taken from the experience that often times tending a bit more towards
upwinding can be advantageous for accuracy [5].
 D 0 corresponds to the central diﬀerence scheme (CDS) whereas  D 1
results in the upwind diﬀerence scheme (UDS).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Boundary conditions for the velocities
At this stage, the boundary conditions (BC) for the velocity ﬁeld should be
taken into account. The nodes at which the BC are enforced are shown by
grey symbols in Fig. 4.3. Enforcement of the BC is easy, if the ”grey” point
lies exactly at the boundary of the computational domain. If not, two cases
should be considered. If the Neumann condition is enforced @u

Splitting schemes for solution of 
multidimensional  problems
5.2
Splitting according to physical processes.
Fractional step methods
Within the fractional step method the original equation is split according
to physical processes. Splitting according to physical processes is used for
unsteady problems. The general idea is illustrated for the transport equation:
@u
@t D Cu C Du C P
(5.10)
Here
C is the convection operator,
D is the diﬀusion operator,
P is the pressure source operator.
Simple explicit Euler method can be written as
unC1 D un C .Cu C Du C P /t
(5.11)
The overall numerical solution is considered as the consequence of numerical
solutions of the following partial problems:
u D un C .Cun/t
(*) Convection step
u D u C .Du/t
(**) Diﬀusion step
unC1 D u C .P /t
(***) Pressure step
(5.12)
solving sequentially. The sense of this splitting is that the numerical solution
of partial problems (*)-(***) is simpler and more stable than that of the
whole problem. The disadvantage of this procedure is that it is applicable to
only unsteady problem formulation. Another disadvantage is the low order
of accuracy with respect to time derivative approximation. The order of time
derivative approximations can be derived using the sample with two physical
processes described by operators L1 and L2:
@u
@t D L1.u/ C L2.u/
(5.13)
The splitting of (5.10) results in two steps procedure:
@u
@t
D L1.u/;

@unC1

(5.15)
The accuracy of the ﬁnal solution unC1 is of the ﬁrst order in time.
Very often the diﬀusion step is treated implicitly. This is done to diminish
the time step restriction for the diﬀusion process. Otherwise, the stability
requires t to be proportional to the spacial discretization squared, if a pure
explicit scheme is applied. The semi implicit scheme for the two dimensional
Navier Stokes equation reads:

the velocity uy component at centers of horizontal faces. The x- equation
is satisﬁed for volumes displaced in x-direction, whereas the y-equation for
these displaced in y-direction.

The Poisson equation for pressure is derived in the same manner as above
for ﬁnite diﬀerence method. For that the equations (6.11) is diﬀerentiated
on x, whereas the equation (6.12) is diﬀerentiated on y. Then both results
are summed under assumptions that both unC1
ij
and un
ij are divergence free:

This equation is coupled with equations (6.11) and (6.12).
The explicit
scheme has advantage that the solution at the time instant n C 1 is ex-
plicitly expressed through the solution at time instant n. The solution of
linear algebraic equations which is the most laborious numerical procedure
is necessary only for the solution of the Poisson equation. The momentum
equations (6.11) and (6.12) are solved explicitly. Velocities unC1
xij
and unC1
yij
are computed then from simple algebraic formula (6.11) and (6.12). The big
disadvantage of the explicit method is the limitation forced by the Courant
Friedrich Levy criterion. The time step t should be very small to secure the
numerical stability. This disadvantage can be overcome within the implicit
schemes.

The Poisson equation for pressure is derived in the same manner as above
for ﬁnite diﬀerence method. For that the equations (6.13) is diﬀerentiated
on x, whereas the equation (6.14) is diﬀerentiated on y. Then both results
are summed under assumptions that both unC1

The resulting Poisson equation can not be solved because both the r.h.s.
(velocities) and the l.h.s (pressure) depend on n C 1. The term on r.h.s.
cannot be computed until the computation of velocity ﬁeld at time n C 1
is completed and vice versa.
Other problem is that the equations (6.13)
and (6.14) are non linear.

Iterative procedure for implicit scheme
To solve the nonlinear system and the whole system of equations we use the
iterative procedure. Let m be an iteration number. The nonlinear term is
represented in form:

Pressure correction method
The velocity ﬁeld satisfying the equation (6.20) is the solution of the lin-
earized Navier Stokes equation.
It doesn’t fulﬁll the continuity equation.
The iterative solution satisfying the whole system of equations is computed
using the pressure correction method.
The iterative scheme consists of following steps. First, the intermediate so-
lution is calculated with pressure taken from the previous iteration:
u D Au C Bp.m1/ C C
(6.21)
The velocity and pressure corrections
u.m/ D u C u0;
p.m/ D p.m1/ C p0

are computed within next steps. Substitution of (6.22) into (6.20) gives
.u C u0/ D A.u C u0/ C B.p.m1/ C p0/ C C
(6.23)
Since u satisﬁes the equation (6.21) the equation for the velocity correction
reads

The equation (6.28) is the Poisson equation for the pressure correction p0.
The solution algorithm is summarized in Fig. 6.2. Let the solution is known
at time slice n, the solution at the next time instant n C 1 is seeking. In the
ﬁrst iteration all quantities are taken from the previous time instant

As soon as the inner loop iterations are converged the solution at time in-

Overview of pressure correction

7.1
SIMPLE algorithm
The linearized Navier Stokes equation written in operator form is
u D Au C Bp C C
(7.1)
Within the SIMPLE algorithm the solution is seeking at each time step in
form of the loop:
 Calculation of the auxiliary velocity
u D Au C Bp.m1/ C C
(7.2)
 Calculation of the pressure correction
rBp0 D ru

 Calculation of the velocity correction

 Correction
u.m/ D u C u0; p.m/ D p.m1/ C p0
(7.5)
7.2
PISO algorithm
In the SIMPLE algorithm we neglected the term rAu0 (see 6.25). In PISO
algorithm this term is taken into account. Actually the term rAu0 can not
be calculated before the velocity correction is computed. Therefore, the term
is taken into account in an iterative way.
7.2.1
First iteration
The term Au0 is neglected, i.e. Au0 D 0. The pressure correction is found
from the Poisson equation

Overview of pressure correction methods
The velocity correction is then
u0 D Bp0
(7.7)
7.2.2
Second iteration
The pressure correction within the second iteration is found from the Poisson
equation
rBp00 D rAu0
(7.8)
The velocity correction within the second iteration is then
u00 D Au0 C Bp00
(7.9)
7.2.3
Correction
Corrected velocities and pressure are
u.m/ D u C u0 C u00; p.m/ D p.m1/ C p0 C p00
(7.10)
Using formula derived above
rBp0 D ru; u0 D Bp0; u00 D Au0 C Bp00; rBp00 D rAu0
it is easy to prove that the velocity u.m/ satisﬁes the continuity equation.
Now we prove the equation u.m/ D Au.m/ C Bp.m/ C C:
u C u0 C u00 D A.u C u0 C u00/ C B.p.m1/ C p0 C p00/ C C
(7.11)
Since
u D Au C Bp.m1/ C C; u0 D Bp0; u00 D Au0 C Bp00
the equation (7.11) is not satisﬁed. The residual is Au00. The residual can be
reduced within next iterations. However, usually, PISO algorithm uses only
two iterations.

The PISO algorithm can be summarized as follows:

Computational grids
8.1
Grid types
The computational grids are subdivided into:
 structured grids (see Fig. 8.1a),
 block structured grids (see Fig. 8.1b),
 unstructured grids (see Fig. 8.1c).
Disadvantage of the structured grid is shown in Fig. 8.2. Reﬁnement of the
grid close to the wall results in the reﬁnement in areas where this reﬁnement is
not necessary. This disadvantage can be overcome by use of block-structured
(Fig. 8.1b) and unstructured grid (Fig. 8.1c).
Figure 8.1: Samples of a) structured grid for an airfoil, b) block structured
grid for cylinder in channel and c) unstructured grid for an airfoil.
The quality of the grid has a strong impact on the accuracy of numerical
prediction. The change of the cell topology within the computational domain

should be smooth especially at the border between diﬀerent grid blocks. The
grid resolution should be high especially in areas of boundary layers and close
to the free surface. For this sake the special reﬁnement is used in these areas.
To increase the accuracy of the computations in boundary layers one uses
special grid boundary layers close to walls.

Overset or Chimera grids
For complicated objects one uses overset or Chimera grids.
The idea of
chimera or overset grids is to generate the grids separately around each geo-
metrical entity in the computational domain. After that the grids are com-
bined together in such a way that they overlap each other where they meet.
The crucial operation is an accurate transfer of quantities between the dif-
ferent grids at the overlapping region. The most important advantage of the
overset or Chimera grid is the possibility to generate high quality structured
particular grids separately for diﬀerent body elements completely indepen-
dent of each other, without having to take care of the interface between
grids.
8.3
Morphing grids
Very eﬃcient way of CFD body simulation is the use of moving or morphing
grids [6]. The idea is the computational grid is moved in accordance with the
displacement of the body by using an analytical weighted regridding which
is a type of extrapolation of rigid transformation. The possible problem of
morphing grid is poor quality caused by its motion.
Consequently if the
mesh surrounding the body is allowed to deform the elements around the
body deform. This can quickly lead to poor quality elements if care is not
taken. An alternative method is to replicate the motion of the body with the
ﬂuid domain split into an inner and outer region. The outer domain remains
ﬁxed in space while the inner domain containing the body moves laterally to
replicate the motion. The mesh in the inner sub domain remains locked in
position relative to the lateral motion of the body. This prevents deformation
of the detailed mesh around the body. The outer mesh is deformed due to
the motion of the inner region.
If moving grids are used the Navier Stokes should be transformed to take the
velocity of grid faces EUg into account,

Where U and S are respectively volume and surface of cells.
The equa-
tion (8.2) is derived from the condition that the computation of the control
volumes or of the grid velocities must be performed in a such a way that
the resulting numerical scheme preserves the state of the uniform ﬂow, in-
dependently of the deformation of the grid. The equation (8.2) is satisﬁed
automatically if the control volumes don’t change their shape. The Geomet-
ric conservation law (8.2) should solve coupled with other ﬂuid ﬂow equations
using the same discretizations schemes.

Physics of turbulence
9.1
Deﬁnition of the turbulence
Flow motions are subdivided into laminar ﬂows and turbulent ones. The
word ” Laminar” in Greek means layer. The ﬂuid particles move orderly
in layers without intense lateral mixing. The disruption between layers is
absent. On the contrary the turbulent ﬂow is very chaotic with strong eddies
and intense mixing across the ﬂow.
Turbulent motion is the three dimensional unsteady ﬂow motion with
 chaotical trajectories of ﬂuid particles,
 ﬂuctuations of the velocity and
 strong mixing
arisen at large Re numbers due to unstable vortex dynamics.
9.2
Vortex dynamics
The vortex dynamics is the key to understand what happens in the turbulent
ﬂow.

9.2.2
Vorticity and vortices
The vortices are main players in turbulent ﬂows.
Here we would like to
emphasize the diﬀerence between the vorticity and vortices. The vorticity
is the curl of the velocity ! D r  u. The vorticity is usually not zero in
viscous ﬂows especially in areas close to the walls. Speaking about vortices
we bear in mind the concentrated structures of the vorticity ﬁeld ! D r u.
The diﬀerence between the vorticity and vortices is illustrated in Fig. 9.1.
The boundary layer is the ﬂow area with strong but smoothly distributed
vorticity (Fig. 9.1a). Due to instabilities, that will be discussed later, the
concentrated vortex structures arise in the smooth vorticity ﬁeld (Fig. 9.1b).
A famous sample of concentrated vortex structures is the tornado (Fig. 9.2).
The vorticity is solenoidal:
r! D r.r  u/ D 0
(9.9)
The consequence of the condition (9.9) is:
 All vortex lines, deﬁned as the lines which are tangential to the vorticity
vector !  dl D 0, are closed in the three dimensional case (Fig. 9.3).
The velocity induced by vorticity ! occupied the volume U are calculated
from the Biot-Savart law:

The velocities induced by two dimensional and three dimensional vortex
structures are shown in Fig. 9.4. An important fact is the appearance of
self induced velocities on curvilinear three dimensional vortex structures.
They are responsible for leapfrog vortex ring motion (http://www.lemos.uni-
rostock.de/galerie/). The self induced velocities is the reason for convective
instability of three dimensional vortex structures.

Vortex ampliﬁcation as an important mechanism
of the turbulence generation
As mentioned above the vortices are main players during the laminar- tur-
bulent transition. The vorticity can be essentially intensiﬁed (ampliﬁed) due
to action of neighboring vortices or even due to self induction.

The r.h.s. of (9.11) contains two terms. The ﬁrst term .!r/u is responsible
for the rotation of the vorticity vector ! and enlargement or reduction of its
magnitude j!j. The second diﬀusion term results in spreading of the vortic-
ity in the space. The term .!r/u is responsible for the ampliﬁcation of the
vorticity.

The eﬀect of the ampliﬁcation can easily be understood if we consider the
vortex with vector aligned along the x-axis !x > 0. If such a vortex is in the
ﬂuid stretching area @ux

of vortons structures can increase exponentially up to the inﬁnity without
viscosity eﬀects. The vorticity growth caused by inviscid ampliﬁcation term
is counterbalanced by the diﬀusion term. Two terms on r.h.s. of (9.11) com-
pete with each other. In the inviscid ﬂuid the circulation of the vortex core
is constant  D
R
S !xdS D const. Increase of !x results in the decrease of
the cross section S. The vortex becomes thinner. The diﬀusion acts against
and makes the vortex thicker. In some ﬂow regions the ampliﬁcation can be
stronger that diﬀusion. The thin vortex losses the stability and is folded.
As shown by Chorin [10] and [11] the folding is necessary mechanism pre-
venting the exponential growth of vorticity. If the ampliﬁcation is too strong,
the vorticity goes to inﬁnity and the energy is not kept constant. Chorin [10]
notes that ”as the vortices stretch, their cross-section decreases and the en-
ergy associated with them would increase unless they arranged themselves in
such a way that their velocity canceled. The foldings achieves such cancela-
tion”. This could be easily explained using a simple sample. If we have just
one straight inﬁnite vortex it induces the velocity in the plane perpendicular
to its axis. If this vortex is tangled the vortex pieces with diﬀerent vorticity
direction are approaching close each to other canceling their induction (see
Fig. 9.5).
Chorin [11] explicitly speciﬁes typical scales of folding: ” the inertial range 1
properties are due to the appearance of folded vortex tubes, which behave on
large scales as self-avoiding walks, and on small scales contain a large num-

ber of folds (=hairpins) that are needed to satisfy the constraint of energy
conservation”.
Summarizing all eﬀects mentioned above one can imagine the following sce-
nario (see Fig. 9.6). Let the vorticity at a certain point of the ﬂow grows.
In the real physical process folding prevents the growth of the kinetic energy
and increases the canceling eﬀect of viscosity. Then the vortex structures
breaks down into small structures due to reconnection mechanism described
in the next subsection.

induction two opposite sides of the ring are merged. As soon as two elements
with opposite vorticity sign are approaching each to other, they start to
cancel each other by mutual diﬀusion. The vortices disappear in the area of
the contact. Two small vortices are created from one big vortex. Each small
vortex ring breaks then down into smaller vortices and so on. The energy
of small vortices is equal to the energy of the big vortex with a small loss
caused by the dissipation. This fact is formulated in the sentence, which is
common in the turbulence theory: The energy is transferred from large scale
vortices to small scales vortices. The reconnection process can be observed
on macroscales.
The decay, break up of tip vortices behind the airplane
proceeds according to the same scenario (see Fig. 9.8). The reconnection
process is, perhaps, the main mechanism of vortex cascade in the turbulent
ﬂows, i.e. transformation of big vortices into small ones. The reconnection
can also lead to enlargement of small vortices if two rings approach each to
other as shown in Fig. 9.7 (see red circle). In this case the energy of small
vortices turns into the energy of the big vortex. This process is referred to
as the energy back scattering. Statistically, the direct energy ﬂux suﬃciently
surpasses the backward one.

Richardson poem (1922)
The vortex turbulence cascade means that large eddies break down to form
small eddies as turbulence cascades from large scales to small ones. This idea
was formulated in the famous poem by Richardson (1922):
Big whorls have little whorls,

plane.
Which feed on their velocity;
And little whorls have lessor whorls,
And so on to viscosity (in the molecular sense).
9.2.6
Summary
Vortex arise in the ﬂuid due to viscosity eﬀects. They experience instability
and ampliﬁcation. Diﬀusion counteracts the ampliﬁcation. If the Reynolds
number is large, the vortex structures are strong and concentrated.
The
ampliﬁcation can dominate at some ﬂuid region over the diﬀusion.
The
vortex instability is not damped by viscosity. The ﬂow becomes stochastic
due to mutual interaction of unstable vortices. The big vortices break down
into small ones by means of vortex reconnection.
The vortex instability
process is identiﬁed as the turbulence.
9.3
Experimental observations
Diﬀerent regimes of the ﬂuid motion were revealed very early, perhaps, in
antique times. Much later, Leonardo da Vinci recognized two states of the
ﬂuid motion and introduced the term ”la turbolenza”.
Arkady Tsinober
in his book ”An informal introduction to turbulence” [1] presented most
outstanding results in turbulence research in chronological order (Fig. 9.9).

Laminar - turbulent transition in pipe. Experi-
ment of Reynolds
Quantitative study of turbulence was started by Osborne Reynolds (1842-
1912) who performed in 1883 very famous experiment shown in Fig. 9.10.
The water ﬂows from the vessel A to the pipe B. The ink injected into the
pipe B with the local ﬂow velocity is not mixed in transversal direction and
keeps its identity if the ﬂow velocity is small (Fig. 9.10, right). The ﬂow
under such a condition is laminar. As soon as the ﬂow velocity increases due
to water level raise in the vessel A, the ink jet loses the stability and is mixed
with surrounding water (Fig. 9.10, right). The ﬂow becomes turbulent. Ink
jet development at diﬀerent ﬂow velocities in the circular pipe is shown in
Fig. 9.11.
The great merit of Reynolds lies in the fact, that he in contrast to his pre-
decessors quantiﬁed the laminar turbulent transition. He showed that the
transition in pipes occurs if the Reynolds number Re D UbD= exceeds the
threshold around  2400. Here Ub is the bulk velocity in pipe determined as
the ratio of the ﬂow rate to the pipe cross section, i.e. Ub D Q=.D2=4/, D is
the pipe diameter and  is the kinematic viscosity coeﬃcient (  106m2s1
for water and   106m2s1 for air). Later, it was shown that the transition
strongly depends on the perturbations presented in the ﬂow. The experimen-
tal setup of Reynolds has been preserved at the University of Manchester in

UK. The experiments done nowadays shown that the laminar- turbulent tran-
sition Reynolds number is less than that documented originally by Reynolds.
The reason is, presumably, the building vibration and noise caused by traﬃc
which was not in time of Reynolds. If the perturbations are eliminated the
transition can be delayed up to Re  40000:::50000.

Laminar - turbulent transition and turbulence in
jets
The jet ﬂows experiences also laminar turbulent transition shown in Fig. 9.12.
Obviously, the ﬂow can be fully or only partially turbulent. Close to the noz-
zle the ﬂow is laminar. The instability is developed downstream. The shear
ﬂow at the jet boundary is the area of rapid velocity change from the jet
velocity to zero outside of the jet. The shear ﬂow experiences the so called
Kelvin Helmholtz instability (Fig. 9.13) resulting in formation of concen-
trated vortices which are approximately circular.
It happens close to jet
nozzle at x=D < 1 (see Fig. 9.14), where x is the distance from the nozzle
and D is the nozzle diameter.
The Kelvin Helmholtz vortices experience then the pairing (see Fig. 9.14).
One vortex overtakes the neighbor vortex creating a pair.
This process
has an inviscid convective nature and can be explained thinking back to
the famous leapfrog motion of two vortex rings.
In the inviscid ﬂow the
leapfrog motion is running as long as the convective instability destroys
the vortices. One vortex runs the next down, its radius decreases whereas
the speed increases.
The radius of the next vortex increases, the speed
decreases.
The ﬁrst ring moves through the second one.
The process is
then repeated. The movie illustrating this process can be downloaded from
http://www.lemos.uni-rostock.de/en/gallery/.

The paired vortices experience the azimuthal instability and takes the crude
ring form. Later they are destroyed downstream in the region 1 < x=D < 6.
In far ﬁeld at large x=D the vortex structures look like a tree with branches
oriented against the main ﬂow direction (see Fig. 9.15).

Physics of turbulence
Creation of vortex rings is the reason for the jet noise. The noise produced,
for instance, by jet propulsors of airplanes is the action of these vortices.
The vortices play a signiﬁcant positive role in jet mixers widely used in food
industry, chemical engineering, etc. That is why, one of the most perspective
way to reduce the noise or to increase mixing is the manipulation of vor-
tices arising behind the jet nozzle. To increase the mixing it is necessary to
strengthen the Kelvin Helmholtz vortices. To decrease the noise the vortices
should be broken down into small ones. Fig. 9.16 shows the eﬀect of the
acoustic impact on jet. The original vortices (lower picture) are split into
small ones (upper picture).
High resolution laser diagnostics methods LIF and PIV allow to get a deep
inside into the structure of the turbulent ﬂow. Fig. 9.17 shows the structure
of the conﬁned jet mixer ﬂow displayed by Planar Laser Induced Fluores-
cence (PLIF) Method. The macrostructure obtained with low resolution is
shown in the upper Figure. A small window with sizes 2:08mm  2:72mm

Laminar - turbulent transition in wall bounded
ﬂows
The boundary layer on a plate is the thin layer of rapid change of the velocity
from zero to 99:5% of the incident ﬂow. A possible scenario of the laminar
turbulent transition in the boundary layer on a ﬂat plate is shown in Fig. 9.19
First, the transversal vortices are generated in the boundary layer due to
the so called Tollmien- Schlichting instability [12]. They experience the sec-
ondary instability and form downstream the lambda structures. The latter
interact each with other and experience the tertiary instability. They loss
original regular form and become stochastic. An important feature of the
turbulent boundary layer is the presence of streaks (strips) of the low ve-
locity ﬂuid regions (see Fig. 9.20). They arise due to induction of lambda
 [47].

Distribution of the averaged velocity in the tur-
bulent boundary layer
A remarkable feature of the turbulent boundary ﬂow is the presence of three
typical velocity distribution regions. The instantaneous velocity distributions
can be quite diﬀerent (see Fig. 9.24). However, the averaged velocity has
typical distribution close to the wall regardless of the ﬂow type.
Let us introduce the following designations:
 y is the distance from the wall,
 w is the stress at the wall,
 u D
q
w
 is the friction velocity,
 yC D uy

is the dimensionless wall distance.
The stress in wall turbulence ﬂow can be considered as the sum of the laminar
and turbulent stresses:
 D l C t
(9.12)

Basic denitions of the statistical theory of  
turbulence
The averaged ﬂuctuation is zero
u0
x;y;z D 0
The root of the averaged square of ﬂuctuations is called root mean square,
or r.m.s.. The quantity averaged twice is equal to quantity averaged once
u D u.
If the turbulence process is statistically unsteady (for instance r.m.s is changed
in time), the deﬁnition of the Reynolds averaging (10.2) is not applicable and
should be extended using the concept of ensemble averaging. Within the en-
semble averaging the stochastic process is repeated N times from the initial
state. The turbulent quantity u is measured at a certain time t  N times.
The ensemble averaged quantity is then:

Isotropic and homogeneous turbulence
The turbulence is isotropic if r.m.s of all three velocity ﬂuctuations are equal
u02
x D u02
y D u02
z
(10.3)
The turbulence parameters are invariant with respect to the rotation of the
reference system. The turbulence is homogeneous in some ﬂuid volume if
all statistical parameters are the same for all points in this volume, i.e.
u02
x;y;z.Ex/ D u02
x;y;z.Ex C Er/.
This equality can be written for all statistical
moments. The turbulence parameters are invariant with respect to the trans-
lation of the reference system.
10.3
Correlation function. Integral length
The product of two ﬂuctuations is the correlation. The product of two ﬂuc-
tuations at two point separated by the distance Er is the correlation function:

(10.4)
If i D j the correlation function Rii is reﬀered as to the autocorrelation
function. In homogeneous turbulence Rii depends only on the separation:

In measurements presented in Fig. 10.1 the scalar f is the concentration of

change of the function has a certain physical meaning. Let us consider the

f 02.rC/
(10.8)
where r is the radial coordinate across the pipe. The f .rC; rA/ is negative. It
means the increase of the quantity f at the point C (f 0.rC/ > 0) is followed
by the decrease of this quantity at the point A (f 0.rA/ < 0) . This is true in
statistical sense, i.e. the most probable consequence of the increase f .rC/ is
the decrease of f .rA/.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Typical form of f and g is shown in Fig. 10.5. The change of the sign of g

length calculated using f is twice as large as that calculated using g.

Taylor microscale 
Until Kolmogorov derived his estimations for vortices in 1941, it has been
thought that the minimum vortices arising in the turbulent ﬂow have sizes
estimated by Taylor. Let us consider the parabola ﬁtted to the autocorre-
lation function at point r D 0. The parabola intersects the horizontal axis
at a certain point. The coordinate of this point  is the scale introduced by
Taylor and called as the Taylor microscale. The Taylor microscale can be
calculated through the second derivative of the autocorrelation function at
r D 0. The Taylor series of f in the vicinity of the point r D 0 is

Probability density function
We take the deﬁnitions from Wikipedia: In probability theory, a probability
density function (pdf), or density of a continuous random variable, is a func-
tion that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to take
on a given value. The probability for the random variable to fall within a
particular region is given by the integral of this variables density over the
region. The probability density function is non negative everywhere, and its
integral over the entire space is equal to one.

Structure function
Kolmogorov introduced the structure function of q order for any stochastic
function. For instance, for the longitudinal velocity along the longitudinal
direction (see Fig. 10.5) it reads:

Chapter 11
Kolmogorov theory K41
11.1
Physical background
One of the most outstanding results in turbulence theory was obtained by
Kolmogorov (s. Fig. 11.1) in 1941. The Kolmogorov theory known as K41
is based on the hypothesis of local isotropy of the turbulent motion at small
scales.
The physical model behind the Kolmogorov theory is the vortex
cascado illustrated in Fig. 11.2. Big vortices with scales L (corresponds to
the wave numbers =L in the Fourier space) break up to small ones, which
in turn split into even smaller and so on up to the smalles vortices with the
scale . One of the most important vortex break up mechanisms is the vortex
reconnection described above. The energy is transferred from big vortices to
small ones almost without the loss. The massive dissipation " takes place
at small vortices referred to as the dissipative or the Kolmogorov vortices.
The real turbulent vortices are similar to these calculated by Isazawa et
al. (Fig. 11.3). Vortices are displayed at three diﬀerent time instants. The
upper pictures are obtained from the lower ones by ﬁltering out the hight
frequencies. As seen big vortices are revealed in low frequency simulation.
If the resolution is increased, more and more small scale vortex ﬁlaments
appears on the place of big smooth vortices.
Thus, the most important
physical processes during the vortex break up are:
 Transfer energy from large scales to small ones and
 Dissipation of the energy in small vortices.

The formula (11.4) is valid for very high Reynolds numbers for the turbulence
being in the equilibrium, i.e. the production of the turbulence is compensated
by its dissipation, i.e. P D ".

The basis of the Kolmogorov theory are three hypotheses, which are supposed
to be valid for high Reynolds numbers Ret D vL

is the characteristic ﬂuctuation velocity.
The Kolmogorov hypothesis of local isotropy reads:
At suﬃciently high Reynolds number Ret, the small-scale turbulent motions
(l  lEI) are statistically isotropic
Here lEI is the lengthscale as the demarcation between the anisotropic large
eddies and the isotropic small eddies. Kolmogorov argued that all informa-
tion about the geometry of the large eddies - determined by the mean ﬂow
ﬁeld and boundary conditions - is also lost. Directional information at small
scales is lost. With the other words, the direction of the vorticity vector !
of small turbulent vortices is uniformly distributed over the sphere. As a
consequence, the statistics of the small-scale motions are in a sense universal
- similar in every high-Reynolds-number turbulent ﬂow (see [14]).
The Kolmogorov ﬁrst similarity hypothesis reads:
In every turbulent ﬂow at suﬃciently high Reynolds number Ret, the statistics
of the small-scale motions (l < lEI) have a universal form that is uniquely
determined by  and ".

(11.8)
Very remarkable is the ﬁrst formula deﬁning the ratio between the smallest
and largest vortices in the ﬂow. If L is, say one meter, and the ﬂuctua-
tion 1m=s, the turbulent Reynolds number in water is Ret D 106.
The
Kolmogorov scale is in this case 32000 as less as the ﬂow macroscale L. Es-
timations of the Kolmogorov scale in the jet mixer with nozzle diameter of
d D 1cm and closing pipe of D D 5cm diameter is shown in Fig. 11.4.
The Kolmogorov second similarity hypothesis reads:
In every turbulent ﬂow at suﬃciently high Reynolds number, the statistics of
the motions of scale l in the range L  l   have a universal form that is
uniquely determined by ", independent of .
This range is called as the inertial subrange. Since the vortices of this range
are much larger than Kolmogorov vortices, we can assume that their Reynolds
numbers lul= are large and their motion is little aﬀected by the viscosity.

Three diﬀerent scale ranges of turbulent
ﬂow
Three diﬀerent ranges can be distinguished in the spectrum of scales in the
full developed turbulence at high Reynolds numbers Ret (Fig.11.5):
 Energy containing range at l > lEI (according to Pope [14], lEI  1
6L).
Within this range the kinetic energy of turbulence is generated and big
turbulent eddies are created.
 Inertial subrange at lDI < l < lEI (according to Pope [14], lDI  60).
Within this subrange the energy is transferred along the scales towards
dissipative vortices without any signiﬁcant loss, i.e. "  0. The energy
density obeys the Kolmogorov law (11.10).
 Dissipation range l < lDI. The dissipation of the energy of big vortices
occurs within the dissipation range.
The inertial subrange and dissipation range belong to the universal equilib-
rium range. Three corresponding ranges can be distinguished in the distribu-
tion of the energy density over the wave numbers k Fig. 11.6. The presence
of the inertial and dissipation subranges was conﬁrmed in numerous exper-
imental measurements performed after development of the K41 theory (see
Fig. 11.7, 11.8).

Classiﬁcation of methods for calculation
of turbulent ﬂows.
The energy spectrum Fig. 11.6 is used to classify three main methods of tur-
bulent ﬂows modelling (Fig. 11.9). The most general strategy is the Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS). Within the DNS the whole spectrum of tur-
bulent structures is modelled starting from the biggest vortices of the energy
containing range till the smallest dissipative Kolmogorov vortices. The Large
Eddy Simulation (LES) models the energy containing vortices and a fraction
of vortices corresponding to the inertial subrange.
The eﬀect of remain-
ing vortices is considered using diﬀerent approximation models. Since small
vortices are universal, the models are also supposed to be universal. The
Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) models are dealing with the large
vortices corresponding to the energy containing range. The eﬀect of other
vortices is taken by diﬀerent semi- empiric models which are not universal.

K-62
The strongest and simultaneously the most questionable assumption of the
Kolmogorov-41 is: Dissipation rate is an universal constant for each turbulent
ﬂow. Already in 1942, during a scientiﬁc seminar the Nobel price laureate

Landau noted, that the dissipation rate is a stochastic function, it is not
constant. We consider the consequences of the neglect of this fact.
According to the Kolmogorov - Obukhov law the structure function of the

ence of laminar spots in every turbulent ﬂows even at very high Reynolds
numbers.

of Kolmogorov and Obukhov.
After the deviation between the K-41 and measurement was documented,
Kolmogorov tried to improve his theory. New Kolmogorov theory called as
K-62 was published in 1962.
New theory is based on two following assumptions:

Unfortunately, various experiments showed later that the second assumption
is proved to be wrong.

Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equation (RANS)
Laminar stress appears due to viscosity eﬀects whereas the Reynolds stress
is caused by ﬂow ﬂuctuations. Now the system of four ﬂuid equations (three
URANS+ continuity) has ten unknowns: three averaged velocity compo-
nents Nui, averaged pressure Np and six Reynolds stresses.
The system of
ﬂuid dynamics is not closed. Additional relations are necessary to express
the Reynolds stresses through the velocities and pressure. This problem of
determination of Reynolds stresses is called as the closure problem of the
turbulence. A huge amounts of closure models was developed within the
framework of URANS methodology. As said above the URANS methods
models the biggest vortices of the ﬂow. The resting scales, which are ﬁltered
by the Reynolds avergaing out, are big enough and not universal. This is
the reason why the URANS models are not universal. Most of them are of
semi empirical character. They are based on submodels with few constants
selected for simple canonical ﬂows. Non universality of closure models is the
biggest weakness of URANS turbulence modelling.
The majority of URANS models used in engineering are based on the Boussi-
nesq hypothesis which is the formal extension of the Newton hypothesis to
turbulent ﬂows. Boussinesq proposed to express the Reynolds stress through
the strain rate tensor Sij D 1

would result in the sum of the diagonal terms of the strain rate matrix

It would
be wrong result because k ¤ 0. The turbulent closures (12.20) are referred
to as the isotropic because the coeﬃcient t is equal for all matrix elements

While the kinematic viscosity depends on the liquid, the turbulent kinematic
viscosity depends on the turbulent state of the ﬂow. According to estimation
of Landau the ratio of the turbulent kinematic viscosity to the kinematic one
is proportional to the ratio of the Reynolds number to that corresponding to
the transition for this type of ﬂow

The URANS closure models are subdivided into algebraic and diﬀerential
ones. The most prominent model amount the algebraic models is the Prandtl
model described above. The disadvantages of the algebraic models are:
 they are good only for the simplest ﬂow,
 not suitable for 3D ﬂows,
 not suitable for separation ﬂows,
 turbulent viscosity depends on averaged values of velocities,
 do not consider the ﬂow history.
These disadvantages can be overcome using diﬀerential models which are
subdividided into one, two and multi equation models. One and two equa-
tion models are usually isotropic based on the Boussinesq approach (12.20).
Among the one equation models the most modern and eﬃcient is the model
of Spalart Allmares (SA model) written for the modiﬁed kinematic turbulent

The two last terms are unclosed. Here we face with the famous problem noted
ﬁrst by Friedman and Keller (1924): Eﬀort to derive the equations for the
second order moments u0
iu0
k results in the necessity of determination of new
unclosed terms including third order moments u0
iu0
ju0
k. Using the method
proposed by Friedman and Keller in 1924 it is possible to derive equations
for moments of arbitrary order. However, the equation for the m  th order
will contain unclosed moments of the m C 1  th order.
Impossibility of
obtaining of a closed system of equations for a ﬁnite number of moments,
known as the Friedman-Keller problem is a direct consequence of the nonlin-
earity of the Navier Stokes equations.
The also unclosed term

is responsible for the energy generation, i.e.
the transport of the energy
transfer from averaged (mean) ﬂow to oscillating ﬂow (ﬂuctuations). And,
ﬁnally,
"ik D 2 @u0

(13.25)
is the dissipation. This unclosed term is responsible for the transformation
of the turbulent kinetic energy into the inner energy of the ﬂow.
RSM model based on equations (13.14) is used to determine the Reynolds
stresses from the transport equations.
It is not based on the Boussinesq
approach and takes the anisotropy of stresses into account. This model is
the best one among RANS models.

As soon as k and " are known the turbulent kinematic viscosity t is com-
puted from (14.35) and Reynolds stresses can be calculated from the Boussi-
nesq hypothesis and then substituted into the Reynolds averaged Navier
Stokes equations. The problem is mathematically closed.
The k  " model is the classical approach, which is very accurate at large Re
numbers. At small Re number, for instance close to the wall, the approxima-
tions used in derivation of k  " model equations are not valid. To overcome
this disadvantage various low Reynolds k  " models were proposed.
14.3
Method of wall functions
Basic relations of k  " model were derived under assumption that the local
turbulent Reynolds number Ret D
p
kL= is very high. This is not the case
in the wall ﬂow. Due to damping eﬀect of the wall, the velocity pulsations
and the turbulent kinetic energy are small. Application of the k  " model
is not valid. An eﬃcient solution of this problem was proposed by Spalding
who developed the method of wall functions. The wall function is an ana-
lytical representation of the solution close to the wall which is matched with
the numerical solution far from the wall. Below we derive basic relations of
the wall function method following to the textbook [15].
It is assumed that the turbulence is in equilibrium, i.e. P D ":

LES ﬁltering
Within the LES all vortices are subdivided into large resolved vortices and
ﬁne modelled subgrid vortices. The border between vortices should lie within
the inertial range. The separation of ﬁne scale motions (small ﬁne vortices)
from large ones is done using the spatial ﬁltering. Let ' be any stochastic
function which is represented as the sum of ﬁltered part and ﬂuctuation:

Three diﬀerent ﬁltering functions shown in Fig. 1: ideal ﬁlter, Gauss ﬁlter
and top hat ﬁlter. Ideal ﬁlter is applied in Fourier space. High frequencies
are cut oﬀ. Low frequencies are simulated directly. The top hat ﬁlter is some
kind of smoothing applied in physical space. The simplest case is smoothing
over three neighboring points

Properties of ﬁltering
The spatial ﬁltering and Reynolds averaging are both ﬁltering operations.
LES spatial ﬁltering has properties which diﬀer from these of Reynolds av-
eraging. First, the spatialy averaged quantity is not zero. Double ﬁltering is
not equal once ﬁltering:

A very important conclusion from this table is the fact that the small scale
motion is universal. Therefore one can expect that the models describing the
small scale motion in contrast to RANS models are also universal.

Smagorinsky model
Note that the ﬁne scale vortices are not resolved. They ﬁltered out by the
ﬁltering operation. The eﬀect of these vortices is taken by the term SGS

into account. Since the small vortices are not modeled, the subgrid stress are
calculated using phenomenological models. The most recent phenomenolog-
ical model was proposed by Smagorinsky in 1963. The Smagorinsky model
is just the extension of the Boussinesq approach

used. Common values are 0:065 and 0:1.

We ﬁnish this section with a very important comment:
 the LES models are consistent when the resolution increases, i.e.  ! 0.
Indeed, if the resolution is increased,  ! 0, the SGS stresses disappear.
The LES equation is passed to the original Navier Stokes equations. The
LES simulation becomes the DNS simulation if  ! 0. On the contrary, the
URANS simulation is not consistent when  ! 0. The Reynolds stresses
don’t disappear if the resolution is increased  ! 0. The turbulence is then
twice resolved.

Model of Germano ( Dynamic Smagorin-
sky Model)
The classical model of Smagorinsky with the parameter CS being constant
for the whole computational domain is proved to be very diﬀusive. Germano
proposed to calculate the Smagorinsky constant CS being variable both in
space and in time, i.e. CS D CS.x; t/. The constant is determined using the
dynamic procedure which is then referred to as the Dynamic Smagorinsky
Model (DSM).
According to the deﬁnition the subgrid stress is

Germano introduces the double ﬁltering or the test ﬁltering designated as
⌢u D OQu. Here the tilde symbol means the ﬁrst ﬁltering with ﬁlter width 
whereas the hat symbol stands for the second ﬁltering with ﬁlter width ∼2.
The symbol means the resulting double ﬁltering. Using the deﬁnition (15.4)
we can write

The system (15.11) is overdeﬁned (six equations for one unknown coeﬃcient

2Mij QSij
(15.12)
Use of (15.14) is problematic since the denumerator Mij QSij can become zero.

condition of the minimum residual of the equation (15.11):

since ıijMij D 0. The solution (15.15) corresponds to the minimum of Q(C)
since the second derivative @2Q=@C 2 is positive at this point

Theoretically the constant C can become negative. The case C < 0 and

to strong numerical instability. That is why the dynamic constant is limited

Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
Despite the fact that diﬀusion of the classic Smagorinsky model was sub-
stantially reduced by the dynamic choice of the Smagorinsky constant, the
Dynamic Smagorinsky model remains very diﬀusive. This disadvantage was
overcome within the similarity models.
The main point of the similarity
model is the assumption that the statistical properties of the once ﬁltered
ﬁeld Qui are identical to these of the double ﬁltered ﬁeld QQui. It is the case
if the ﬁlter width is small. The diﬀerence between once and double ﬁltered
velocities is negligible, i.e. diﬀerent scale motions are similar.
Let us consider Quj as the original (unﬁltered) ﬁeld.
QQuj is the ﬁltered ﬁeld
and Quj  QQuj is the pulsation (see Fig. 15.2). Then from the deﬁnition of the
subgrid stress one obtains
 SGS
ij
D e
Qui Quj  QQui QQuj
(15.18)
The formula (15.18) is the scale similarity model proposed by Bardina et
al. [16]. As seen the SGS stress can be calculated directly from the resolved
ﬁeld Qui.
15.6
Mixed similarity models
The experience shows that diﬀusion produced by the scale similarity mo-
del (15.18) is too low. The numerical calculations are often unstable using
this model. Taking the fact into account, that the diﬀusion of the Smagorin-
sky model is too high, it was decided to combine the Samgorinsky and scale
similarity models to get the proper diﬀusion. The advantages and disadvan-
tages of both models are summarized as follows
 Dynamic Smagorinsky Model (DSM): energy dissipation is overesti-
mated (drawback), energy backscattering is not reproduced (draw-
back),
 Scale similarity model: energy backscattering is reproduced (advan-
tage), energy dissipation is underestimated (drawback).
The idea combine models to strengthen the advantages and to overcome dis-
advantages of both models. The hybrid model called as the mixed similarity
model is written as

stress does not satisfy the Galilean invariance condition. The Galilean in-
variance is the independence of basic formula of mechanics on the speed of
the reference system.
The classical deﬁnition of the SGS stresses possesses the Galilean invariance.
Indeed, let V be the speed of the reference system. The velocity relative to
the reference system is

A-posteriori and a-priori tests
Two tests are used to verify LES models. The comon way is the a-posteriori
test. The LES simulation is performed and then the ﬂow parameters obtained
from the simulation are compared with these from measurement. Depending
on comparison results the conclusion about quality of LES models is drawn.
The disadvantage of such approach is that the LES results are aﬀected by
modelling errors, errors of approximation of diﬀerential operators and round-
ing errors. In a-posteriori test they can not be separated.
Direct test of quality of subgrid stresses is the a-priori test. First, the subgrid
stress is calculated at each time instant from the deﬁnition

Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
A big diﬃculty of a-priori tests is the determination of velocities Qui. For
that it is necessary ﬁrst to obtain the unﬁltered velocities ui with spatial and
temporal resolutions compared with the Kolmogorov scales. At present this
is a big challenge to measure three components of velocity in a volume with
high spatial and temporal resolutions. The Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
measurements are mostly planar measurements within a two dimensional
window. Direct Numerical Simulation data are often used as the source for
a-priori tests. Three components of velocity in a volume, obtained from DNS,
are ﬁltered and utilized for the test. However, it should be noted that DNS
simulation is restricted by relatively low Reynolds numbers, whereas main
laws of LES are valid for high Re numbers.

Hybrid URANS-LES methods
Chapter 16
Hybrid URANS-LES methods
16.1
Introduction
by (Spalart et al.[22]). The original version of this method is based on the
classic Smagorinsky LES model and the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) URANS ap-
proach. SA is used close to the wall, whereas LES in the rest part of the
ﬂow. The switching between the two techniques is smooth and occurs in
a ”gray” subdomain.
There are two major improvements of DES, devel-
oped recently. The ﬁrst one, DDES (Delayed DES), has been proposed to
detect the boundary layers and to prolong the RANS mode, even if the wall-
parallel grid spacing would normally activate the DES limiter (Spalart [23]).
The second one, IDDES (Improved DDES), allows one to solve the prob-
lems with modelled-stress depletion and log-layer mismatch. For the details
see the review (Spalart [23]). In spite of a wide application area DES has
serious principle limitations thoroughly analyzed by (Menter, Egorov [24]).
Other versions of the turbulence matching methods using diﬀerent blend-
ing functions to switch the solution between LES and URANS modes were
proposed by (Peng [17]; Davidson, Billson [25]; Abe, Miyata [26]) and others.
As discussed above, the most promising approach to resolve the ﬂow un-
steadiness is the Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which is already widely used
for research purposes. Typical Reynolds numbers in engineering are very
large even at model scales. The grid resolution necessary for a pure LES
is so huge that it makes the direct application of LES impossible (see Sec.
16.4). A practical solution of this problem is the use of hybrid URANS-LES
methods, where the near body ﬂow region is treated using URANS and far
ﬂow regions are treated with LES.
According to Peng [17] the hybrid techniques can be subdivided into ﬂow
matching and turbulence matching methods.
Within the ﬂow matching
methods the interface between URANS and LES is explicitly deﬁned. LES
ﬁltered equations are solved in the LES region, whereas URANS equations
are solved in the URANS domain. The ﬂow parameters (velocities, kinetic
energy) are matched at the interface between the URANS and the LES re-
gions. Among the most important contributions to the development of ﬂow
matching methods we mention the works of (Davidson, Dalstroem [18]; Ter-
racol [19]; Jakirlic et. al. [20]; Temmerman et. al. [21]) and others. A
serious weakness of this approach is the development of robust procedures to
set the URANS-LES interface for complicated ﬂow geometries. Within the
framework of the turbulence matching method an universal transport equa-
tion is solved in the whole computational domain. The stress terms in this
equation are treated in diﬀerent ways in LES and URANS domains. There
are various procedures to distinguish between LES and URANS cells. The
most popular hybrid method is Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) proposed

Hybrid URANS-LES methods
A very critical point of the turbulence matching methods is the transition
from the time (or ensemble) averaged smooth URANS ﬂow to the oscillat-
ing LES ﬂow, see (Menter, Egorov, 2005). The oscillations have to appear
within a short ﬂow domain in a ”gray zone” between LES and URANS. Ex-
perience shows that it is extremely diﬃcult to provide a smooth transition
of the turbulent kinetic energy passing from the URANS to LES domain. To
overcome this problem (Schlueter et al. [27]) and (Benerafa et al. [28]) used
an additional forcing term in the Navier Stokes equation artiﬁcially enhanc-
ing ﬂuctuations in the gray zone. However, the problem of smooth solution
transition from URANS to LES still remains as the main challenge for the
turbulence matching methods.
16.2
Detached Eddy Simulation (DES)
The most popular hybrid method -detached eddy simulation- was proposed
in 1997 by Spalart et al. [22]. The principle of DES is illustrated in Fig. 16.1.
Close to the body the solution is calculated using the URANS mode. Far
from the wall the LES equations are solved. The grey zone between URANS
and LES is the mixed solution.
The classical version of the DES approach is based on the Spalart Almaras
(SA) model formulated with respect to the modiﬁed turbulent viscosity Q D
t=f1. The transport equation for Q reads

DES inventors proposed to use the following expression for d:

where CDES  1:3 is the DES constant. Now the main idea of the DES
becomes obvious:
 At small wall distance d < CDES the Spalart Almaras URANS model is
active
 At large wall distance d > CDES the Spalart Almaras URANS model is
smoothly passed into the Smagorinsky model.
Samples of DES applications are presented in Fig. 16.2 and 16.3.
Despite of the wide application Detached Eddy Simulation technique is not
free of disadvantages. Menter [24] notes: The essential concern with DES
is that it does not continuously change from RANS to LES under grid re-
ﬁnement. In order for LES structures to appear, the grid spacing and time
step have to be reﬁned beyond a case-dependent critical limit. In addition, a
suﬃciently large instability mechanism has to be present to allow the rapid
formation of turbulent structures in regions where the DES limiter is acti-
vated. If one of the two, or both requirements are violated, the resulting
model is undeﬁned and the outcome is largely unpredictable.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Hybrid URANS-LES methods
The integral length scale is calculated from the known formula of Kolmogorov
and Prandtl with the correction factor 0:168 taken from [12]
L D C k3=2
" ;
(16.4)
where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and " is the dissipation rate. The
constant C is C  0:168 close to the wall y=ı < 0:2, C  0:35 at 0:2 < y=ı <
0:7 and C  1:0 in the outer area of the bounder layer y=ı > 0:7, where ı is
the boundary layer thickness. L varies from one time step to another, which
results in varying decomposition of the computational domain into the LES
and URANS regions. The extended LES ﬁlter is computed as
 D
q
d 2
max C ı2;
(16.5)
where dmax is the maximal length of the cell edges dmax D max.dx; dy; dz/
and ı D .the cell volume/1=3 is the common ﬁlter width used in LES. This
choice ensures that very ﬂat cells in the boundary layer (for which ı  0
but dmax > 0) are treated correctly.  depends only on the mesh and it is
precomputed only once before the main computation.
As a sample LES and URANS regions are shown in Fig. 16.4 for ﬂow around
a tanker. The URANS region is located close to the ship surface and plays
the role of a dynamic wall function. In areas of bilge vortices formation, the
boundary layer is shedding from the hull and penetrates into the outer ﬂow
part. Since the boundary layer is a ﬁne scale ﬂow the procedure (16.3) recog-
nizes the bilge vortex formation zones as URANS ones. There is a technical
issue concerning the cells which are far from the ship hull and where both
k and " are small, so large numerical errors are introduced into the integral
length scale computed according to Eq. (16.4). To avoid an irregular dis-
tribution of URANS and LES zones, the general rule (16.3) of the domain
decomposition is corrected in such a way that the LES region is switched to
URANS one if k is getting less than some threshold. This procedure has no
inﬂuence on the ship ﬂow parameters since it is used far from the area of the
primary interest.
We have performed several calculations with diﬀerent combinations of LES
and URANS models to ﬁnd the most eﬃcient one for the problem under
consideration. Among the models we used in our computations are the linear
and nonlinear k-", k-! SST and k"v2f URANS models combined with the
simple and dynamic Smagorinsky as well as with the dynamic mixed LES
closure models. The experience shows that the most satisfactory results are
obtained using the URANS approach based on the k"v2f turbulent model
of [30] and LES approach based on the Smagorinsky dynamic model. The
turbulent stresses t
ij are calculated from the Boussinesq approximation using
the concept of the turbulent viscosity.
The only diﬀerence between LES
and URANS is the deﬁnition of the kinematic viscosity. Within LES it is
considered as the subgrid viscosity and calculated according to the dynamic
model of Smagorinsky:

Estimations of the resolution necessary
for a pure LES on the example of ship
ﬂow
In the CFD community one can observe tendency to use pure LES without
paying any attention to resolution problems. Very often LES is running on
typical RANS grids. In fact, such computations can give correct results if the
ﬂow structures to be captured are large enough and exist for a long time. In
some cases modeling of such structures does not require detailed resolution
of boundary layers and a thorough treatment of separation regions. As an
example one can mention ﬂows around bluﬀbodies with predeﬁned separa-
tion lines like ship superstructures. Application of underresolved LES for
well streamlined hulls should be considered with a great care. First of all,
one should not forget that the basic LES subgrid models are derived under
the assumption that at least the inertial turbulent subrange is resolved. Sec-
ond, underresolution of wall region leads to a very inaccurate modeling of
the boundary layer, prediction of the separation and overall ship resistance.
It is clearly illustrated in the Table 16.1. The ship resistance obtained from
underresolved LES using the wall function of (Werner, Wengle [31]) is less
than half of the measured one and that obtained from RANS. Obviously, the
application of modern turbulence LES models, more advanced than RANS
models, does not improve but even makes the results much worse with the
same space resolution. The change from RANS to LES should deﬁnitely be
followed by the increase of the resolution which results in a drastic increase
of the computational costs. These facts underline necessity of further devel-
opment towards hybrid methodology. Although in (Alin et al. [32]) it has
been shown that the accuracy of the resistance prediction using pure LES at
a very moderate resolution with yC  30 can be improved using special wall
functions, the most universal way for the present, to our opinion, is applica-
tion of hybrid methods. The impossibility of pure LES is illustrated below
for ﬂow around the KVLCC2 tanker.

The precise determination of the necessary LES resolution is quite diﬃcult.
Estimations presented below are based on the idea that about 80% of the
turbulent kinetic energy should be directly resolved and the rest is modeled
in a properly resolved LES simulation. Implementation of this idea implies
the knowledge of the Kolmogorov  and the integral length L scales which are
used to draw the typical spectra of the full developed turbulence E.k/. The

The maximum possible cell size is then max D 2=k. The scales L and

the kinetic energy k and the dissipation rate " are taken from RANS simula-

parameter for grid generation. Both lengths vary in space which makes the
grid generation procedure very complicated. To roughly estimate the size of
the grid we assume that  is constant. We performed diﬀerent calculations
determining  at the two following points: i) the point where L= is maximal
in the ship boundary layer and ii) the point in the propeller disk where the
vorticity E! is maximal (region of the concentrated vortex structure). The lat-
ter is dictated by the wish to resolve the most intensive vortex ﬂow structures
which have the strongest inﬂuence on the propeller operation. Since LES ap-
plication is required in the ship stern area only this part of the computational
volume has been meshed. It covers the boundary layer of the stern region
starting from the end of the parallel midship section. The thickness of the
meshed region has been constant and equal to the maximum boundary layer
thickness at the stern ıBL. The grid for a pure LES is generated using the
following algorithm. The minimum Kolmogorov length min is determined
in the near wall region. The cell sizes in x and z directions along the wall
are calculated by multiplication of min with the scale parameter . These
sizes remain constant for all cells row in y direction which is normal to the
ship surface (see Fig. 16.5). The cells have at least two equal sizes which is
desirable from the point of view of LES accuracy. The choice of the size in y
direction is dictated by proper resolution of the boundary layer. Close to the
wall this size is chosen from the condition w D min.yw; min/. Since yw is
chosen as the ordinate where yC D 1 the ﬁrst nodes lay deeply in the viscous
sublayer. The size in y direction at the upper border of the boundary layer
is equal to 1 D ı, where ı is the Kolmogorov scale at y D ıBL. A
simple grading is used in y direction between w and 1.
Results of the estimations are as follows: the required grid size ranges from
 5 M to  25 M for Re D 2:8  106, and from  7 M to  60 M for
Re D 5:8  106. The results vary depending on the value of  in use, so
they should be considered as very rough estimations. Together with simi-
lar estimations for the nonlinear k-" model these results show that the LES

grid should have the order of tens of millions of nodes. Nowadays, the com-
putations with hundred millions and even with a few billions of nodes are
becoming available in the research community. However, a numerical study
of engineering problems implies usually many computations which have to be
performed within a reasonable time with moderate computational resources.
In this sense, the results of the present subsection clearly demonstrate that
the pure LES is impossible for ship applications so far. To verify that the
resolution estimation procedure we used gives meaningful results, it has been
applied for turbulent boundary layer (TBL) benchmark. We found from me-
thodical calculations that the pure LES with 1M cells is quite accurate for
prediction of the velocity distribution, TBL thickness, TBL displacement
thickness and the wall shear stress.
The estimation procedure presented
above predicted the necessary resolution around 0.5M. Therefore, the esti-
mations presented for a ship model are rather lower bound for the resolution
required for a pure LES.

Introduction
The heat transfer inside the human body is an extremely complicated prob-
lem which is diﬃcult to formulate properly. The body generates the heat
within certain organs which is then transferred by the thermal diﬀusion
through the body substance possessing very non uniform properties. How-
ever, the thermal diﬀusion being complicated is not the main diﬃculty of
modeling. A large fraction of the heat generated by internal organs is trans-
ported to the body periphery by a complicated net of blood vessels. This
process has still not been modeled with a desirable accuracy. While a full
detailed model of the human thermodynamics is still remaining the problem
of the future, the practical design of protection clothes demands the reliable
models already now. Such models are necessary to reduce the time and costs
consuming measurements and to avoid dangerous experiments with people
under emergency conditions. The models can be only of a semi empiric char-
acter and must relay on measurements data to diminish the modelling errors.
Especially interesting is the case of human thermodynamics at high tem-
peratures T of surrounding medium.
At T > 350 the ability of human
thermoregulation is very restricted [33]. The acceptable body temperature
variation can be only one degree of Celsius. If the body temperature exceeds
this threshold the protecting mechanisms regulating the excessive heat in the
organism through the breathing, humidity diﬀusion of the skin, radiation and
transpiration don’t work [34], [35]. The most eﬀective principle of the protec-
tion is the mechanism of the heat absorption through, for instance, the ice
embedded into the clothes. This approach being environmentally friendly,

Human body and ice protection models
The human body model used for simulation is shown in Fig. (17.1). The
main sizes of the body which are important for the discussion of results are
presented in the table 17.1.
Commonly the human body is represented as a set of geometric elements ac-
cording to the original idea proposed by Stolwijk [36]. The body is assumed
to be slender with domination of the heat transfer in horizontal planes. On
the contrary to common models the horizontal cross section of the human
body is represented in our model as a nearly elliptical section with the dis-
placed center.
The cross section of the body is subdivided into the ﬁve
layers [33]: skin, fat layer, muscles and two core layers (see Fig. (17.2)). The
core represents all human organs and blood vessels. The cross section of
the human body is then represented as a set of sectors subdivided along the
radius into ﬁve layers with constant thermal properties (see Fig. 17.2). The

radii of each sector R can be found from the table 17.2. The upper elliptical
cylinder is from the neck to the waist, whereas the lower one from the waist
to the thing (Fig. 17.1). The skin thickness  is approximately calculated as
the radius R divided by 60:25 [33]. The sizes of diﬀerent layers inside of the
cross section are presented in the table 17.3. At the high temperatures the
main part of the heat production occurs in certain organs. The knowledge
about the heat distribution inside the body allows one to choose the most
eﬃcient design of the ice protection which typical construction is shown in
Fig. 17.3. In the mathematical model the ice and the clothes layer are mod-
elled by additional layers covering the human body (Fig. 17.2). The human
body model was developed on the base of data taken from [36], [37], [38]
and [39].
17.4
Mathematical model
It is assumed, that the heat exchange between the sectors is negligible at
every cross section of the human body. Therefore both the vertical and cir-
cumferential heat transfer processes are not taken into account. The heat
transfer along the radius x within each sector is described by the one di-
mensional heat conduction equation derived from the energy conservation
consideration. The change of the internal energy in the sector element with
coordinates x and x C dx due to heat transport within the time dt is

Mathematical model of the ice protection 
of a human body at high temperatures 
of surrounding medium
The temperature of the surrounding medium was Tmed D 500. It was as-
sumed that the core center (at x D 0) temperature was constant in time
Tcore D 36:70.
The heat transfer process is subdivided into three steps. Within the ﬁrst
step the ice is warmed up to the melting temperature. The melting process
is followed by the absorption of the heat coming from both the surrounding
medium Qmed

(17.9)
where med is the thermal diﬀusivity of the clothing layer adjacent to the
ice layer, Amed is the surface between the ice layer and adjacent clothing
layer in a sector under consideration, skin is the thermal diﬀusivity of the
human skin and Askin is the skin surface in the sector. The second step is the
ice layer melting. The phase transition in matter is described by the Stefan
problem [40]. In this paper we used a simpliﬁed approach based on the heat
balance conditions. It is assumed that the water and ice mixture is uniform
with the constant temperature of zero degree of Celsius. The dynamics of
the boundary between the water and ice is not considered. The heat ﬂuxes
(17.8) and (17.9) are constant in time. The second step is ﬁnished in time t
once the ice is melted:
Qmelt D . PQmed C PQskin/t 
(17.10)
Here Qmelt is the heat necessary to melt the whole ice. After that, within
the third step the water from the melted ice is warming up due to heat ﬂuxes
(17.8) and (17.9) continuing in time. The calculations within the third step
are running as long as the comfort conditions are fulﬁlled.
The equation (17.4) is solved using the ﬁnite diﬀerential method on the
uniform grid x D const with the constant time step t D const. The
numerical implementation utilizes the central diﬀerential scheme for space
derivatives and Crank Nicolson implicit representation of the unsteady term.
An inhouse code was developed for this purposes.

Design of the protection clothes
The calculations were performed for ﬁve elements of the human body shown
in Fig.17.1. Thermodynamic properties of the body layers are given in the
table 17.4. Usually, the ice protection construction consists of the ice layer
separated from the surrounding medium by several layers. In the present
work we used three layers: outer clothing layer with thickness of 0:001m, iso-
lating layer of 0:009m and the air layer of 0:003m. All layers have the initial
temperature T 0
i D 190. The air gap between the ice and the underwear of
the thickness 0:0025 m was 0:003 m thick. The human body was 180 cm in
height with the mass of 80 kg. The full description of the input data can be
found in [41]. It was assumed that the test person does the work at a rate of
about M D 420 watts. Additional heat release due to this work was taken
into account during numerical simulations in the heat production rate f .x/
(see Eq. (17.4)).

The numerical simulations are used to ﬁnd the distribution of the ice thick-
ness necessary to keep the body core (both inner an outer) temperature at less
than 36:70˙10 within one hour at the temperature of surrounding medium of
500. The numerical results were utilized to design a special protection jacket
for rescue team working under emergency conditions in the mining industry.
Since the continuous distribution of the ice protection is diﬃcult from the
technology point of view and undesirable from ergonomics considerations the
jacket protection was designed using the discrete distribution of the ice in
form of briquettes embedded into the jacket (see Fig. 17.4). The further
simulations have been performed to prove the ability of the new designed
jacket to satisfy the protection requirements. Fig. 17.5 illustrates the tem-
perature distribution around the human body in centers of the upper and the
lower elliptical cylinders shown in Fig. 17.1. The discrepancy between the
desirable temperature 36:70 corresponding to the continuous ice distribution
and the actual temperature corresponding to the discrete ice distribution can
be considered as acceptable. Therefore the jacket designed on the base of
numerical simulations was manufactured and tested in further experimental
investigations.

Experimental proof of numerical prediction
The numerical prediction and the jacket designed on basis of numerical sim-
ulations was proved in various tests. The ﬁrst series of 48 measurements
was carried out in a thermal chamber. The measurements were performed
with healthy candidates at the age between 30 and 45 years, P D 168  188

cm in height and normal weight m. The body surface A can be calculated
from the empirical formula A D 0:24m0:425P 0:4 [41]. The candidates weared
the jackets (see Fig. 17.4)were doing the work at a rate of about M D 420
watts which corresponds to a hard work typical for the mining industry. The
temperature of the surrounding medium was T  500. The temperature has
been measured in the air gap between the underwear and the ice at seven
points around the chest (section 2 in Fig. 17.1). The temperature averaged
over these points is presented in Fig. 17.6. The discrepancy between the
measurement and the numerical simulations does not exceed 14 percent af-
ter 60 minutes of the real time. This agreement can be considered as quite
satisfactory taking the simplicity of the used model and complexity of the
problem into account.
Figure 17.7: Test person weared overheating protection jacket (left) and
distribution of the temperature sensors on the human body (right).
The task of this study is the determination of the temperature in the body
core. It is a diﬃcult problem since the direct measurement is impossible.
The experience gathered in physiology [42] shows that the core temperature
can reliably be determined if the temperature Tj at ﬁve characteristic points
(forehead, chest, hand, thigh and shin) is known (see Fig.17.7). The sensors
were mounted directly on the human skin with the rate of press not exceeding
0:2  0:25 Pa. The accuracy of measurements is estimated as 0:10C. These
temperatures are summed up with weighting coeﬃcients wj. Each tempera-
ture is nearly constant within a certain area Aj. The weighting coeﬃcients
are calculated as the ratio of Aj to the total body surface A, i.e. wj D Aj=S.
The averaged temperature is calculated then from the formula [41]

The correlation factor K is taken from the table 17.5 [39]. Figure 17.8 shows
the time history of the inner temperature Tinner. The most important con-
clusion drawn from this ﬁgure is that the inner temperature Tinner doesn’t
exceed the threshold 360 within 60 minutes. Thus, the aim of the design has
been achieved.

The second series of measurements was carried out directly during the work
in a cole mine at the temperature not higher than 600 without ﬁre action.
During one year of observations no equipment fault has been documented.
The temperature of workers was kept at a prescribed level during at least
55  60 minutes as predicted both in numerical simulations and thermal

Discussion
This chapter presents relatively simple and eﬃcient model of the heat trans-
fer within the human body at high temperatures of the surrounding medium.
The human body cross section is represented as an ellipse with a few lay-
ers, modelling the internal organs. The heat generation by internal organs
is taken into account. The ice protection and the clothes are modelled as
additional layers covering the human body. Neglecting the heat transfer in
vertical and circumferential directions the problem is reduced to the solution
of the one dimensional heat conduction equation with variable heat diﬀu-
sivity. The simulations were performed using the ﬁnite diﬀerential method.
Results of simulation were used for calculation of the ice layer thickness nec-
essary to prevent the body overheating and to keep the temperature of the

Chapter 18
CFD Design of cloth for
protection of divers at low
temperatures under current
conditions
Study was performed for the model Tin Man presented in Fig. 18.1. Inner
thermodynamics in the body was not modelled. The temperature of the hu-
man body was assumed to be constant and equal to 330 at the temperature
of the surrounding medium of 10 degrees of Celsius.
Thus, the Dirichlet
boundary conditions were enforced for the temperature whereas the heat
ﬂux from the body was calculated. Heat exchange by shivering, breathing
and radiation was neglected. The heat exchange between the body and sur-
rounding medium is mostly determined by the convection due to wind. The
incompressible ﬂow was calculated using steady RANS (Reynolds Averaged
Navier- Stokes Equations) using the k  ! SST model. Temperature was
considered as a passive scalar determined from the temperature transport
equation. The framework OpenFOAM was utilized for the numerical solu-
tion of this problem.
First, CFD was validated for the case of the air ﬂow. Distribution of the heat
transfer coeﬃcient along the Tin Man body is shown in Fig. 18.1, left. The
minimal heat ﬂux takes place in the separation area with reduced ﬂow veloc-
ities, i.e. behind the body arms and head, as well as in the stagnation area
in the front part of the body. Figure 18.1 illustrates the integral coeﬃcient
of the heat transfer hc obtained by integration over the whole body sur-
face. Results of authors marked by crosses are compared with experimental
data of de Dear et al. (triangles) and diﬀerent calculations. Shadowed grey
area shows the scattering of data otbained using various approaches. Big

CFD Design of cloth for protection of divers at

scattering of data illustrates the complexity of the problem of the human
body thermodynamics interaction with a surrounding medium. Our results
agree satisfactory with measurements. Note that the calculations at small
air speeds were performed assuming the laminar character of the ﬂow.
Within the next step the Tin Man body was weared in a neoprene cloth
with the thickness of 1:0 cm to reproduce the case of a diver working at
low temperatures of 100 in a sea current with the speed of 1 m=s. The Tin
Man body temperature was uniformly distributed along the body and was 33
degrees of Celsius. The cloth was assumed to be waterproof and uniformly
contaminated by oil products. This case is typical for ship repair works and
rescue and technical operations in oil spill zones. Contamination in terms
of gram per centimeter squared as well as the heat diﬀusivity coeﬃcient of
contaminated cloth are given in the table 18.1. The size of the computational
domain was 12126 meters, whereas the size of the body was 1:65 meters.
For discretization a mesh with 1:3 million of cells was used with yC values
below 0:5 on the whole body. The results for heat ﬂux depending on the
contamination are presented in the last column of table 18.1 and in Fig. 18.2.
As seen the heat ﬂux is almost linear function of the contamination.
The Tin Man body is a primitive simplest geometry. From one side, it makes
the solution of the inner thermodynamics problem much easier. From the
other side, such simpliﬁed geometry is not suitable for aerodynamic calcula-
tions since it consists of sharp edges with numerous strong separations. Nu-
merical solution becomes unstable leading to unsatisfactory convergence. Al-
though the real human body is geometrically more complex, the ﬂow around
it can be calculated much easier than in the Tin Man case. Therefore, fur-
ther investigations done by our group were performed for real human body
geometry (Fig. 19.1) designed by the Hohenstein Institute [43] based on the
detailed antropological study of diﬀerent people categories.

Chapter 19
CFD application for design of
cloth for protection from low
temperatures under wind
conditions. Inﬂuence of the
wind on the cloth deformation
and heat transfer from the
body.
Lebedeva and Brink [44] have shown the inﬂuence of wind on heat transfer
due to cloth deformation caused by wind induced pressures. Experimental
study was performed in open type wind tunnel with closed test section up to
Reynolds number of 3:6  105 based on the air speed and diameter of cloth
packages in form of cylinders. The aim of the present work is to get similar
estimations for real human body form.
19.1
Wind tunnel measurements of pressure
distribution
The experiment was conducted in the wind tunnel of the Chair of Ocean
Engineering at the Rostock University. The wind tunnel of the G¨ottingen
type has the test section of lengths of 2:8 m with the square cross section
of 1:4  1:4 m2. The model of the height of 700 mm was manufactured by

downsizing the real body with the scale factor of 0:39. Within the open test
section the size of the air jet with uniform velocity distribution is estimated
as one meter at least. Since it is one and half times as large as the model
height, the inﬂuence of the jet boundaries on ﬂow around the body can be
considered as negligible. Two measurement series were performed. In the
ﬁrst one the pressure was measured at nine points distributed at three cross
sections z D 0:329; 0:418 and 0:476 (see Fig. 19.1 and 19.3) using inclined
manometers which are very accurate for low pressures measurements. Due
to high inertia of inclined manometers the unsteady pressure oscillations
are not captured.
Position of measurement points is shown in Fig. 19.1
(points 1; 10; 100, 5; 50; 500 and 9; 90; 900). The measurements were performed
with the air speed of 10m=s at 14 degrees of Celsius.
Reynolds number
based on the maximum transversal body size is around 1:33  105. In the
second series the measurements were performed at nine points 1; :::; 9 shown
in Fig. 19.3(right) only at z D 0:418 (waist). This more detailed investigation
was carried out for two air speeds of 10 and 15 m=s.
19.2
Numerical simulations of pressure dis-
tribution and comparison with measure-
ments
Numerical simulations were performed using the commercial software pack-
age STAR CCM+ for the air speed of 10 m/s. The boundary layer on the
windward side is supposed to be in transitional state. Due to strong sep-
aration the ﬂow on the leeward side of the model and in the wake can be
considered as a turbulent one. The computational domain has the cross sec-
tion of 2:1  2:1 m2. A length of the domain is 2:1 m in front of the human
body (0:7 m height) and 4:2 m behind it.
The grid consists of 1:2  106
polyhedron cells with maximal yC value of 40. On the model sides the yC
value is varied between 20 and 25. To exclude ambiguity connected to the
ﬂow character, simulations were performed both for pure turbulent and pure
laminar ﬂows with and without roughness.

19.3
Comparison of CFD results with mea-
surements
Comparison with measurements for the ﬁrst series is presented in Fig. 19.2.
The results of measurements and simulations agree well in the front part of
the body and in the separation area. Both simulations and measurements
predict the increase of the pressure coeﬃcient in the section z D 0:476 m
at angle  90 degrees caused by the stagnation eﬀect of the shoulder. On
the side of the model in cross sections z D 0:329 and 0:418 the agreement is
not satisfactory. To clarify this problem, the more detailed second measure-
ment series was performed. All results obtained at z D 0:418 are presented
in Fig. 19.3. The big diﬀerence takes place around the angle of approx. 90
degrees in the area of the separation (point 5 in Fig. 19.1). The experiment
doesn’t predict the strong under pressure region on the side of the model.
The minimum experimental pressure coeﬃcient is around 1 whereas the
simulation predicts 2:2 both for laminar and turbulent cases. The diﬀer-
ence between the laminar and turbulent solutions is negligible. This might
be due to two facts.
First, the cross section is elliptical (Fig. 19.2, left)
and the averaged position of ﬂow separation points is ﬁxed at the widest
axis and doesn’t depend on the ﬂow character.
Second, strong unsteady
ﬂow oscillation makes the diﬀerence between laminar and turbulent pressure
distributions negligible.

CFD application for design of cloth for 
protection from low temperatures under wind 
conditions. Infl uence of the wind on the cloth 
deformation and heat transfer from the body.
The experimental results raised many questions.
Without big error, the
ﬂow can be considered as quasi two dimensional in cross sections along the
human body. Then Cpmin is minus three for the case of two dimensional
cylinder ﬂow. Due to three dimensional eﬀects Cpmin can be smaller, but
not three times smaller like in measurements.
The numerical simulation
reveals no separation up to angle of 90 degrees. Within the separation zone
at angles larger than 120 degrees the numerical pressure coeﬃcient is nearly
constant. These facts are in a good agreement with classic knowledge about
bluﬀbodies ﬂows.
In experiment, Cp slightly increases in the separation
area at angles larger than 90 degrees.
Also, a relatively big discrepancy

around the body at three diﬀerent altitudes z D 0:329; 0:418 and 0:476m.
between Cp determined for 10 and 15 m/s seems to be very questionable, at
least within the zone of weak Reynolds number inﬂuence, i.e. at angles less
than 90 degrees. The ﬂow at angles larger than 90 degrees is unsteady. The
scattering of the data due to unsteady eﬀects is shown both for simulations
and measurement.
Obviously, the unsteady pressure oscillations can not
be reason for the disagreement between simulation and experiments. More
detailed experimental study should be carried out in the future to clear this
problem.

Change of thermal conductivity caused

formed experimentally in the Thermal laboratory of the Don State Technical

It was assumed that the pressure acts only in normal direction and shear
stresses are neglected. The cloth has such a structure that it can be pressed
but not stretched. With the other words, the cloth has no deformation if
the pressure diﬀerence p D p  patm is negative. Bearing this in mind, the
cloth deformation calculated using numerical pressure data can be considered

experiments and simulations. The cloth samples were subjected to pressure

Simulation of human comfort
conditions in car cabins
The comfort conditions of drivers and passengers is one of the most important
research topics in car industry. In this chapter we present a fragment of the
research conducted in this ﬁeld at the chair of modelling and simulation of
the University of Rostock. The calculations presented below were carried
out by Stefan Knochenhauer. A compact car was chosen as the object of
investigations. The cabin geometry is represented in Fig. 20.1. The inlet
of the air stream coming from the ventilation channel is marked by green
color whereas the air outlet by red one. The grid with 6.5 million of cells
is shown in Fig. 20.2. The mathematical model is based on the URANS
equation (12.17) and temperature transport equation (1.30). The turbulent
character of the temperature transport is taken into account by introduction
of the additional turbulent heat conduction.
It means that instead of 
in the equation (1.30) we use the sum  C t, where t is the turbulent
heat conduction coeﬃcient. t is expressed through the turbulent kinematic
viscosity t and the turbulent Prandtl number P rt

Simulation of human comfort conditions in car cabins
t
cp
D t
P rt
(20.1)
The turbulent kinematic viscosity is computed from the URANS closure mod-
els (see Chapters 12, 13 and 14) whereas the turbulent Prandtl number is
assumed to be constant P rt  0:7. The URANS closure model used in this
work is the k  ! SST model [45]. Numerical simulations were performed
using the ﬁnite volume method (see Chapter 6). Boundary conditions are
given in the table 20.1.
A few selected results of calculations are illustrated in Fig. 20.3. The distri-
butions of air velocity and temperature inside of the car cabin are strongly
inhomogeneous. In regions of strong velocity the convective heat transfer
dominates whereas in stagnation areas the heat exchange is mostly due to
the heat conduction.
