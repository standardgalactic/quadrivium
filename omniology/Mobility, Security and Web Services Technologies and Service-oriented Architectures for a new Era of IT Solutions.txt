Foreword
The deﬁnition and realignment of business strategy is crucial for enterprises whose pri-
mary objective is to achieve sustainable success and proﬁts in a world of steadily
changing market requirements. In this context, the core business processes are the
backbone of enterprises’ business activities. Enterprises must focus more and more on
these processes and key strategic competencies in order to stay competitive, which in
turn will lead to greater specialization and elaboration of their value chain. The conven-
tional concept of the value chain is now being expanded to include the value network,
where on the one hand components are bought in and on the other hand processes such
as purchasing, ﬁnancial services, and personnel services are outsourced to specialist
partner companies.
The support provided by IT services, and their underlying architectures, applications,
platforms and infrastructures are increasingly crucial if companies are to meet these
new challenges, while at the same time ensuring more efﬁcient business operations. IT
services and solutions are more than ever required to ensure a quick response to chang-
ing business priorities and activities, while also enabling consolidation of processes,
adoption of the latest technologies and operational cost savings. 
In view of this changing business environment and IT challenges, the subject of this
book – 
 
Mobility, Security 
 
and
 
 Web Services
 
, embedded in service-oriented architec-
tures – are of topical interest for IT organizations. From the solution perspective, line
managers need to be aware of the driving forces of these technologies and the resulting
business opportunities. However, they must also carefully consider the inherent risks.
Mobility, Security and Web Services will have a far-reaching impact on IT infrastruc-
tures and solutions. Though they are disparate technologies with independent technical
implications and histories, they must be considered jointly in the context of overall par-
adigm shifts and business needs that will be witnessed over the next decade.
The author, who has many years of experience in the IT sector, describes the complex
interrelations of the latest technologies in a clearly comprehensible way. He points the
way ahead towards a new era of IT solutions that are capable of meeting future business
requirements.

Foreword
After a long process of convergence and evolution, traditional communication systems,
the internet and mobile communication networks have developed into a strong innova-
tive force in our society. The continuing dynamic developments are characterized not
only by exciting technical innovations, but most of all by the growing importance of
social and particularly of economic aspects. Modern information and communication
technology (“IT” for short) is fundamentally changing the world. Being mobile and
able to communicate securely and in every conceivable way and to use services efﬁ-
ciently and ﬂexibly – that’s what people want today.
As an international forum for communication research, the MÜNCHNER KREIS [F1]
has focused on the development of telecommunications and related technological,
social, economic and political questions for more than thirty years. The group pays par-
ticular attention to the conditions under which innovative steps can be carried out suc-
cessfully, with a special focus on interdisciplinary analysis so that trends or paradigm
shifts can be recognized early and their ramiﬁcations properly assessed. 
This book – ‘Mobility, Security and Web Services’ – examines subjects that have
recently been the subject of intense discussion at conferences of the MÜNCHNER
KREIS. One of the resulting insights is that IT will play a key role as the common link
between a slew of innovative communication and application scenarios. As a result,
infrastructures and platforms that have grown over time will change fundamentally.
New mobile applications and service-oriented solution approaches will affect our lei-
sure time and private life just as much as future business solutions. While remaining
security gaps and related risks have been recognized among experts, the explosiveness
of these problems is often underestimated. 
Our society must master this change. Wider education and greater awareness are called
for. With the help of numerous examples, this book explains how communication and
information technologies are converging. It applies structure to the complex interac-
tions and uses descriptive illustrations to make them understandable. The author
explains key evolutionary steps, focuses on corporate solutions and application archi-
tectures, and provides useful recommendations for IT organizations. 
This fascinating yet practical outlook toward a new IT era opens up many new and
interesting perspectives for the reader. Let’s hope that this book will help us to not just
cope with this change, but to actively manage it!

1 Introduction
Information and communication technologies have been developing at a breathtaking
speed, their evolution accelerating despite the recent slow-down in the economy.
Experts are convinced that this development will continue throughout the next decade
and we may expect it to result in changing business requirements, new business oppor-
tunities, and changes in the behaviors and wishes of consumers who inhabit what will
hopefully be a wealthier, prospering society. These are trends that will inﬂuence virtu-
ally every area of human activity. 
 
Mobility

 technology number among the most exciting of the emerging orientations
that will bring about signiﬁcant changes in every aspect of IT infrastructure, accompa-
nied by the development of so-called Middleware and securitized methods for imple-
menting business solutions.
This book will explain why these issues are crucial. It will highlight the consequences,
in particular as they impact medium-sized and large enterprises and will describe the
effects on such business’s information and communication infrastructures and e-busi-
ness solutions.
Mobility
The power of web technology has ushered in a new business age. The world of e-busi-
ness has its roots in the ability to leverage and integrate the various data sources and
processes that constitute an enterprise’s business assets and deliver them to consumers,
employees or partners via web portals. Where companies were once limited to only
those customers they could contact in person, the Internet now moves millions of con-
nected consumers within their reach. 
In the future, the world of wireless connectivity will give people the ﬂexibility to do
business wherever they are. Mobile phones, PDAs and wireless handheld computers
will liberate professionals and consumers and enable global connectivity anywhere,
anytime. Instead of being tied to a desk, individuals will be contactable wherever and
whenever there is a sign of interest and, conversely, they will be able to access their
personal resources via any network, whether ﬁxed or wireless. 
The decreasing cost and increasing speed of wireless networks are driving the move to
wireless communication. Technological developments are now converging to enable
wireless devices to act as clients in tomorrow’s e-business world. Mobile technology,

1 Introduction
10
commercial and business needs, coupled with network and device availability, are all
combining to drive the evolution of mobile business.
New types of application will arise as mobile technology becomes more affordable.
Mobile phones will be taken up by very nearly all economically active consumers. The
Internet and the evolution of mobile devices and networks are both considered to be
major trends. Their convergence signiﬁes the birth of a new era.
Developments in the mobile business sphere over the next ﬁve years will be dominated
by the transition from e-business to mobile business solutions. This move will be
fuelled by the emergence of new technologies. Combined web/mobile portals endowed
with considerable functionality will be crucial for the integration of e-business and
mobile business.
Very signiﬁcant progress will be achieved as a result of end-to-end secured transac-
tions, always-on applications and location-based services in GPRS networks, ﬂexible
broadband services with WLAN technology at high-demand venues such as airports,
hotels, or exhibition centers, 
 
ad hoc
 
 networks enabled by Bluetooth technology; and,
ﬁnally, rich multimedia applications vehicled by third-generation UMTS networks.
Mobile business architectures will be based on the same n-tier models used in today’s
e-business solutions. The integration of mobile business into existing e-business archi-
tectures will constitute the mainstream for the foreseeable future. 
However, there are a number of inherent aspects such as the limitations of today’s
mobile device technology that not only differentiate the mobile Internet from the tradi-
tional Internet environment, but also complicate application development and the pros-
pects for progress.
It is important to recognize that building mobile solutions is not just a matter of integra-
tion but also of understanding this emerging mobile environment. Enterprises therefore
frequently need to call on consultants in their efforts to assess the value of mobility as
it relates to their organization and business processes.
Web services and the service-oriented architecture
Another important area of change is the evolving web services paradigm. This new par-
adigm may prove to be the most signiﬁcant avenue of progress for electronic business
solutions during the current decade.
It is comparable to the shift from the unitary manual production of parts to the assem-
bly or production line approach introduced in the automobile industry decades ago.
Today, production lines are fully automated thanks to the use of dedicated robots for
the majority of production processes. By analogy, workﬂow engines will control the
process ﬂow of e-business solutions, while web services will constitute the process
steps performed by robots in an assembly line.
Web services are structured within a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). This consti-
tutes a distributed computing environment in which applications call functionalities

1 Introduction
11
from other applications either locally or remotely over a network in a loosely-coupled
way. 
The SOA is characterized by the ability to publish a service in a network, with two
other signiﬁcant capabilities being provided inherently: discovery, i.e. the ability to ﬁnd
a required functionality (service), and binding, i.e. the ability to connect automatically
to this functionality. 
The IT industry has been talking about SOA and web services for a number of years.
The beneﬁts of having a loosely-coupled, language-neutral, platform-independent
method of linking applications within organizations, across enterprises, and across the
Internet are becoming increasingly evident as web services come to be employed for
large-scale production purposes. 
Web services are autonomous, self-contained, self-describing modular applications
that can be deployed either within an enterprise – where they offer a simpler way of
achieving modular and/or distributed computing aims – or that can be published,
located and invoked across the Internet. 
When discussing new technological trends, analysts have remained adamant about the
signiﬁcance of web services and stressed the very committed involvement of all of the
major software vendors such as IBM, Microsoft, SAP, BEA, Sun, HP and Oracle. They
predict that web services are going to be critical to IT infrastructures for the next 20
years. They see an extended web as a way of allowing businesses to become more agile,
sense trends and respond more quickly. 
The revolutionary nature of web services technology is that enterprises now create and
deploy distributed applications without regard to the hardware platform, operating sys-
tem, programming language, or network topology of any party wishing to communi-
cate with the chosen web service application.
In the past, security concerns were the main factor inhibiting the widespread deploy-
ment of web services. Professionals in the IT industry have spent more than 20 years
developing methods for enabling secure communication between applications in a cor-
porate, leased-line, distributed WAN environment. Companies now expect the use of
web services over the Internet to be based on secure foundations. 
Provided that the security issues are solved, the vision that, thanks to SOA and the
widespread deployment of web services, the Internet will evolve into a Business Web in
which web services may be dynamically combined very ﬂexibly and efﬁciently to rep-
resent any kind of business process may yet become a reality. 
Moreover, the vision of the agile enterprise and the real-time enterprise implies the
seamless integration of all business processes. Real-time enterprises will support not
just individual business processes, suboptimized via IT systems and applications, but
will also achieve the ﬂexible, consistent integration of business processes with suppli-
ers, partners and customers across enterprise boundaries. Real-time enterprises will be
able to respond ﬂexibly to customer needs and market changes while focusing on their
core competencies, leaving extensively integrated strategic partners to concentrate on
other selected activities. 

1 Introduction
12
The question remains: is this another high-tech bubble that can soon be expected to
burst, similar to the dotcom phenomenon? Or will it become a reality in the foreseeable
future? Although no deﬁnitive answer is possible at present, the paradigm shift is
already underway. 
Security
Beside the trend toward increased mobility, enterprises have undergone a dramatic
transformation in recent years – enterprises are now operating in a global economy and
increasingly run ofﬁces in multiple locations with growing numbers of remote workers
who all need to communicate and share information in real-time. Communication and
information sharing between different ofﬁces in the same company or between supply
chain partners are now imperatives, no matter where the various ofﬁces are located or
what time of the day it is. It is essential for communication and information sharing to
be guaranteed by secure business processes, regardless of whether or not the different
business partners have access to protected Intranet data and applications.
Nowadays, everyone expects the required information or services to be available in
real-time. Customers will no longer wait for the information they need to make busi-
ness decisions. Enterprises today have to meet these expectations and to provide the
services their customers require.
However, there is an increasing conﬂict between the security an infrastructure can gen-
uinely provide and its users’ need for extended real-time access. The challenge facing
organizations is to strike a balance between accessibility to corporate resources and the
maintenance of a security level that is sufﬁcient to ensure that the company’s assets and
sensitive business processes are not put at risk. This is a delicate balance that can only
be assessed accurately by examining the speciﬁc business context and calculating the
threat to the various business processes. It is difﬁcult to strike the correct balance at any
given time, a fact that may explain the tendency of many enterprises to remain with
their existing security infrastructure. CIOs worry about how to maintain security while
at the same time supporting innovative e-business solutions with the associated
increase in access requirements.
Security has always been a top priority, especially where e-commerce and sensitive
e-business processes are concerned. The new challenges of wireless Internet access and
the greater integration of mobile employees, partners and customers make potential
shortfalls signiﬁcantly more probable. Moreover, web services and SOA will add a new
dimension to the challenge posed by security, in particular in cases involving the
dynamic interaction of partners who have never done business together before.
However, a more or less comprehensive framework of security standards for web ser-
vices has now been elaborated, and although the task is not yet complete, appropriate
products are now available. The good news is that the new security standards for web
services have been designed to interact with and deploy existing basic security tech-
niques such as Kerberos, Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Digital Certiﬁcates and Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI).

1 Introduction
13
An analogy may make it easier to understand the concept of web service security. It
acts as a security guard who accompanies the information to ensure that it arrives
unmanipulated at its destination. The guard not only makes sure that the information
travels securely from the sender to the recipient, traversing bridges, boundaries and
intermediate stages, but also protects the data and takes into account the identity of the
sender. It is the fulﬁllment of this combination of tasks that makes for secure business
processes. 
All businesses need to address these unavoidable challenges, and security is conse-
quently now an issue that requires the involvement of the executive board. Security
awareness at the board level is the ﬁrst step in recognizing the real risks associated with
e-business processes and provides the basis for the development of an appropriate secu-
rity strategy which balances security needs with affordable costs and acceptable risks.
Moreover, conﬁdence is the single most important thing that is needed for businesses to
compete successfully. Conﬁdence is a great enabler, making it possible to exploit new
opportunities through e-business – reaching more customers, working more closely
with suppliers, empowering employees and driving new revenue streams. However,
conﬁdence is only possible when every participant knows that every business-related
interaction is totally secure. Thus the implementation of a reliable and secure infra-
structure will add real value to enterprises, which will stay competitive by deﬁning
standard e-business processes.
 
Issues not considered here
 
One key future topic in the IT sector which is very closely bound up with the question
of web services is not covered in this book: grid services. The combination of grid
computing – middleware that has already been developed for scientiﬁc computing –
and web services to form grid services is a challenging development that is the subject
of intense discussion among IT experts. Collections of grid services are required to per-
form more complex functions that cannot be offered by individual services. Grid ser-
vices constitute a central building block for tomorrow’s computing paradigm: On-
demand computing. On-demand computing possesses the potential to transform com-
puting into a utility provided in the same way as water, power or telephone services,
which is why this paradigm is also referred to as utility computing.
The examples used in the following chapters frequently refer to proven products and
platforms. Open source platforms will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role
in modern e-business solutions. However, any reasonably detailed consideration of
open source software would go beyond the scope set for this book. 
The author placed great emphasis on ensuring that the information provided in this
book is up-to-date. However, the products or standards referred to may change over
time. As an example, the product cycle of mobile phones is currently only nine months.
The author therefore apologizes if, on occasions, a reference fails to cite the most
recent version of a product.

Over the last two decades, the application scenarios mobilized by business solutions
have changed signiﬁcantly, as evidenced by IT architectures and paradigms, networks
and communication technologies as well as by the classes of mobile devices.
This chapter highlights some of the past developmental phases within a historical con-
text and points to the directions development might take in the future.
2.1 IT paradigm shifts
Business processes in enterprises are supported by an underlying IT infrastructure and
applications. These control and optimize enterprise resources and support purchasing
processes, supply chain management, customer relationship management and other
processes. As ﬁgure 2.1 illustrates, two application paradigm shifts constitute the most
profound changes to IT infrastructures and business solutions that have arisen since the
eighties.
Figure 2.1 Evolution of application scenarios

2.1 IT paradigm shifts
15
In the late eighties, the old monolithic application paradigm, characterized by unstruc-
tured and inﬂexible applications, designed using 3rd and 4th generation programming
languages, running on mainframe (host) systems, and supporting dumb, text-oriented
terminals has been replaced by a 2-tier client/server application paradigm. 
Paradigm shifts do not usually come about due to the evolution of a single technology
or as a result of a unique invention, but rather through a complex of mutually comple-
mentary, emerging new technologies, ideas and business needs that combine to create
added value.
The shift to the client/server paradigm represents a clear demonstration of this hypoth-
esis. 
The business needs: competitive companies in the eighties needed to get more users
online, distribute applications to different locations and facilities, generate separate
databases from their applications in order to use and manage them independently of the
application and, ﬁnally, wanted to work with more comfortable graphical user inter-
faces.
The technological developments: PC and LAN technology can be considered to be the
main evolutions that made this paradigm shift possible. However, other developments
such as the power of the emerging Unix server platforms, graphical user interfaces and
rich database management systems have complemented one another and combined to
make the paradigm shift a reality.
The idea: Give the client processing power and intelligence in order to distribute the
workload to more economic platforms. In addition, provide users with a more conve-
nient user interface and with ofﬁce tools that support their daily tasks more efﬁciently.
10 years later, another paradigm has started to establish itself as the result of signiﬁcant
technological developments and emerging business-related requirements: 
 
web-based
e-business. 
The business-related factors include globalization, shorter product cycles, more ﬂexi-
ble corporate structures, virtual organizations, the creation of closer customer and part-
ner relationships and, ﬁnally, the increasing demand to do business anytime, anywhere
in the world. 
It is without doubt the development of Internet technology that has acted as the princi-
ple driving force in shifting the IT world towards today’s state-of-the-art, multitier
architectures – described in chapter 3 – and the new web-based, e-business application
paradigm. The Internet and e-business have now become part of everyday working life
and, regardless of the dotcom hype and ensuing crash, new business opportunities such
as e-commerce and e-auctioning with millions of users have been seized on success-
fully. 
Another signiﬁcant evolution which, in combination with those mentioned above, has
permitted the shift to the web-based, e-business paradigm, is the establishment as a
standard of XML (eXtensible Markup Language). XML, which evolved jointly from the
document-oriented SGML (Structured Generic Markup Language) and the presenta-

2 Evolution of information and communication technologies
16
tion-oriented HTML (HyperText Markup Language), may now be considered to be the
lingua franca of the Internet. 
XML, as an open standard which is widely accepted by industry, underpins interopera-
bility. It permits the description of data, documents, information, content of all types,
protocols and programs. It makes it possible to separate data/content and presentation,
and acts as a single source for the generation of diverse presentation formats for work-
places and mobile devices. It greatly facilitates data exchange across industries and
between business systems regardless of platform, operating system or the underlying
technology. Finally, XML is the technology underpinning remote function calls and
web services. 
As a second stage in the emergence of this web-based paradigm, another development
– wireless Internet access using a variety of innovative mobile devices to exploit Inter-
net services via mobile access networks – will increasingly change both individual life-
styles and business operations. A number of mobile business solutions has now been
successfully implemented, optimizing business processes by, for example, reducing
travel costs and creating new value for customers, partners, employees and enterprises.
The technologies and architectures involved in this web-based, e-business paradigm –
including the question of mobile access – are discussed in more detail in chapter 3.
Moreover, chapter 3 also looks at the architectural changes apparent in forward-look-
ing, e-business application platforms in terms of the deployment of web services and
the increased integration of mobile applications.
2.2 Network evolution 
During the last three decades, the Internet has developed to become a unique global
network infrastructure providing unlimited access to information and new commercial
opportunities.
In the seventies, its function was to ease military deployment and provide expert uni-
versity networks. In the eighties, it became a showcase for the pioneers of new technol-
ogies while the nineties represented the dawn of the e-commerce era. This evolution is
illustrated in ﬁgure 2.2.
The Internet and the evolution of mobile devices and networks are both considered as
megatrends. The convergence of the two will lead to a new era – the Mobile Internet
era. Within the next decade, the number of Internet subscribers will again increase sub-
stantially, with the majority of users employing mobile devices. The use of mobile
devices makes the Internet an Everywhere Marketplace and provides the impetus for
the development of innovative business models.
The technological evolution of the wired Internet in the last few years has been impres-
sive. The development of optical network and switching/router equipment gives the
Internet core network literally unlimited bandwidth capacity. The capacity of optical
ﬁbers has increased by a factor of 200 over the last decade and the deployment of

2.2 Network evolution 
17
Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) technology makes transmission
speeds of more than 1 Tb/s theoretically possible.
Nonetheless, the most exciting developments have taken place in the ﬁeld of radio fre-
quency networks. The following brief outline illustrates the variety of new mobile net-
work technologies and indicates how rapidly they have developed. Some of these tech-
nologies were not even known just 5 years ago.
GSM 
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is a representative of the 2nd gener-
ation of mobile communication systems. While the 1st generation was based on analog
technology, the 2nd uses digital technology which brings about signiﬁcant advantages
in terms of the total costs, the quality and the size of mobile devices.
Introduced in 1996, GSM [2.2.1], a European standard, is the most successful of the
mobile phone network technologies with a global market share of about 70% and net-
work providers offering GSM networks in more than 200 countries worldwide includ-
ing 100% coverage in Europe. In the near future, more than 1 billion subscribers will
use GSM networks. GSM networks will remain in use at least up to 2010, though
GPRS and 3rd generation networks will offer much larger bandwidths, improvements
on existing services and a range of innovative services. 
GPRS 
Growing out of GSM, GPRS (General Packaged Radio System) networks provide
voice and data services. GPRS has been available since 2002 in most GSM networks
and offers three key beneﬁts for the providers and users of data services:
Figure 2.2 Internet evolution

2 Evolution of information and communication technologies
18
– It reduces the costs of providing connectivity in comparison to circuit-switched tech-
nologies like GSM. GPRS constitutes a connectionless technology that uses network
resources more efﬁciently since applications occupy the network only when data is
actually being transferred. 
– It provides greater bandwidth – roughly comparable to ISDN bandwidth with
approximately twice the burst transmission rate. 
– It also provides transparent IP support. By transparently tunneling the IP protocol
from the mobile device to the Internet or Intranet and giving the device the same sta-
tus as an IP server on a LAN, GPRS provides seamless mobile access to the Internet
and corporate Intranets. 
GPRS is the ﬁrst mobile network that allows always-on connectivity. The combination
of always-on/packet switching with volume instead of time-based pricing and data
transmission rates comparable to those available with ISDN has the potential to boost
mobile data access. 
 
SMS/MMS
 
The 
 
Short Message Service (SMS)
 
 is a wireless network service initially used in GSM
networks where it constituted the ﬁrst data service. It allows the asynchronous trans-
mission of up to 160 characters in one message. Today, every GSM phone supports
SMS. It has developed as the GSM killer application, with more than 20 billion mes-
sages being sent every month.
MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services) is a combination of SMS, Audio Message Ser-
vices, Photo Message Services, Video Message Services and Group Message Services.
As a result, a mobile phone supporting MMS can send a message that contains one or
any combination of the above-mentioned elements: text, audio, photos, graphics and
video. In a work context, for example, speech or written comments can be added to a
photo or video clip of a machine in order to provide maintenance instructions. The
Group Message Service makes it possible to send an MMS to a user-deﬁned group of
recipients in a single operation, thus reducing transmission costs. MMS is supported in
GPRS networks but may be widely deployed in 3rd generation networks because of the
need for additional bandwidth.
WAP 
The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a protocol for synchronously delivering
data over mobile networks to the Internet and receiving data from it. It speciﬁes an
application framework and network protocols for wireless devices, mainly mobile
phones but also optionally PDAs. It takes account of the current constraints of wireless
networks and devices, such as limited bandwidth, less powerful CPUs, memory capac-
ity, and limited input/output capabilities. 
The framework was elaborated by the 
 
WAP Forum
 
, with the ﬁrst version making its
appearance in 1999. Since then, the WAP Forum has been integrated in the Open
Mobile Alliance [2.2.2]. Although its launch did not prove to be a success, WAP is now

2.2 Network evolution 
19
an established Internet access standard for mobile devices worldwide and particularly
in Europe. Today’s mobile phones usually support WAP.
The WAP protocol model is derived from the web model. It allows network operators,
software vendors, service providers and enterprises to build applications and services
that can reach a variety of different mobile platforms efﬁciently and effectively. It also
includes a microbrowser environment containing the following functionality:
– Wireless Markup Language (WML) – a lightweight markup language similar to
HTML but simpliﬁed
–
 
WML Script
 
 – a lightweight scripting language similar to JavaScript
– Content Formats – a set of deﬁned data formats, including images, phonebook and
calendar
–
 
Wireless Telephony Applications (WTA)
 
 – telephony services and application inter-
faces.
The Wireless Session Protocol (analogous to HTTP) constitutes the WAP application
layer and offers consistent interfaces for both connection-oriented and connectionless
services. The Wireless Datagram Protocol (partially analogous to TCP/IP) provides the
general transport services and decouples the upper layers from the different bearer ser-
vices, which may take the form not only of GSM and GPRS but also of other networks
provided in Asia and America.
More details of WAP are provided in chapter 4 (architecture) and chapter 6 (security). 
i-mode
A proprietary protocol and mode to obtain Internet access from mobile phones, i-mode
was introduced in Japan in 1999 by the country’s largest network operator NTT
DoCoMo. Unlike WAP, it has enjoyed great success ever since the time of its launch. 
Instead of WML, i-mode uses a presentation language known as cHTML (compact
HTML) which is more similar to HTML. i-mode is based on packet transmission, i.e.
utilization costs are priced by packet, regardless of usage time. The use of packet trans-
mission and the pricing model have undoubtedly been crucial factors in i-mode’s busi-
ness success. In addition, widely appreciated services coupled with a win-win business
model that embraces content providers and business partners have been reasons for i-
mode’s rapid take-up in Asia.
i-mode is now also offered by a number of network operators in Europe. However, as it
is not an open standard it is not supported by the majority of mobile phones supplied in
Europe. In competition with WAP, i-mode will probably not play a dominant role either
in Europe or in North America.
i-mode and WAP can both be considered as interim technologies. In the near future,
technological solutions will be found to the above-mentioned technical limitations that
constrain both devices and mobile networks, thus providing pervasive Internet proto-
cols for implementation in devices as well as in wireless and wireline IP networks.

Migration to 3rd generation mobile networks
The 3rd generation (3G) mobile telephone system in Europe is known as UMTS (Uni-
versal Mobile Telecommunication System [2.2.3]) and was standardized by the ETSI
(European Telecommunications Standards Institute). UMTS is based on W-CDMA
(Wideband-CDMA) technology, which is a broadband evolution of CDMA (Code Divi-
sion Multiple Access). UMTS will offer both real-time (e.g. for speech) and non real-
time modes (e.g. for e-mail) using common mechanisms capable of providing reliable
transport for voice, message, ﬁles and stream-type data. UMTS allows connection-ori-
ented (circuit-switched) as well as connectionless (packet-switched like GPRS) com-
munication.
Although UMTS is associated with transmission speeds of up to 2 Mbit/s, this will be
achieved only in ﬁxed locations. Pedestrians will be offered a speed of 384 kbit/s and
users in moving vehicles 144 kbit/s. 
UMTS services have started to be introduced by carriers in European countries from
2003 onwards.
It is a well-known fact that carriers have paid huge amounts to obtain UMTS licenses
in certain European countries (e.g. € 50 billion in Germany). The carriers will also
need to make additional investments on a similar scale to build the required infrastruc-
ture. As a result, only metropolitan areas will be covered by UMTS networks during
the initial phase. 
UMTS will open up new business opportunities and scenarios and create a bouquet of
innovative applications such as video conferencing, video streaming, and video on
demand. Thanks to 3G systems, users will be able to determine the quality of the voice,
data or video call at the moment it is set up and pay accordingly. Further properties of
UMTS with regard to mobile business applications are discussed in chapter 4.
Figure 2.3 Migration path to 3rd generation mobile networks

2.2 Network evolution 
21
The migration path from GSM (2G) to UMTS (3G) is provided by the so-called 2.5
generation (2.5G) technologies. In most European countries, GPRS has been chosen as
the natural path to 3G. However, as illustrated in ﬁgure 2.3, two other wireless technol-
ogies – HSCSD (High Speed Circuit Switched Data) and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates
for GSM Evolution) – will constitute future developmental steps. However, these will
not have as signiﬁcant an impact as GPRS – at least not in Europe. 
HSCSD, which is purely a connection-oriented technology with a bandwidth similar to
ISDN, has been available from some network operators for several years. It may be
useful for some niche applications, for example when enhanced security requirements
are involved. It nevertheless remains an interim technology.
EDGE will permit data rates of up to 384 kbit/s (connection-oriented as well as connec-
tionless). Widespread deployment is not expected in Europe (with the exception of cer-
tain countries), since the technology requires considerable investment and came on
stream only shortly before the advent of UMTS. 
The situation is different in North America where GSM networks are currently growing
faster than anywhere else. Here, EDGE networks, deployed as a further development of
GSM and TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access, currently used in North America),
make a lot more sense, because 3G networks will arrive later than in Europe.
CDMA networks are primarily employed in North America and Asia (Japan, Korea)
and will have no impact on Europe’s mobile networks. They will evolve via
CDMA2000 1xRTT (2.5G, bandwidth up to 300 kb/s) to CDMA 1xE-DO/DV (3G,
bandwidth up to 5 Mbit/s).
3G networks were ﬁrst introduced in Japan. NTT DoCoMo introduced the FOMA
(Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access) network in 2001. From the very outset, Asia
has played a leading role, with the 3G networks deployed in Japan, Korea and Hong-
Kong now numbering several million subscribers. 
The standardization of 3G networks is promoted by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Projects (3GPP). The 3GPP [2.2.4] is responsible for W-CDMA technology and the
3GPP2 for CDMA technology. The 3GPP is a collaboration agreement, established in
1998, that brings together a number of telecommunications standards bodies.
The consolidation of mobile network carriers by acquisitions and forming alliances is
still in progress due to the huge investments for network infrastructures and innovative
applications. Just two recent examples are the acquisition of AT&T Wireless by Cingu-
lar Wireless LLC in USA and the foundation of the Starmap Mobile Alliance (com-
prises 9 smaller carriers) in Europe. 
Mobile location technologies (GSM, GPRS, UMTS)
The ability to locate the position of a mobile device is crucial for the provision of geo-
graphically speciﬁc value, i.e. added information that stimulates mobile business. Vari-
ous technologies will be available to provide these services.
The simplest of these technologies, and one that is available now is the COO (Cell of
Origin) method. Network operators can correlate phone numbers with the network cell

2 Evolution of information and communication technologies
22
in which the device is transmitting. Depending on the cell size, the sensing accuracy is
between several hundred meters and a few kilometers. 
Some more accurate Location Fixing Schemes (LFS), such as GPS (Global Positioning
System), TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) and E-OTD (Enhanced Observed Time
Difference) will penetrate the mobile market in the near future. These methods provide
location sensing accuracy of between 20 and 200 meters.
Besides these technologies, which require a greater or lesser extent of device and/or
network modiﬁcation, other approaches have been developed which are handset-based
and work in standard GSM/GPRS networks where they offer a precision in the range
of 100 meters.
There is a high probability – at least over the next 2 years – that only the network oper-
ators will own location-dependent information. They will therefore be in a prime posi-
tion to promote location-dependent services.
The challenge now is to bring together the content providers with the geo-coded infor-
mation that makes it possible to exploit this technology. Applications that make use of
mobile location service technologies include ﬂeet management, vehicle tracking for
security purposes, tracking for recovery in the event of theft, telemetry, emergency ser-
vices, location identiﬁcation navigation, route tracking location-based information ser-
vices and location-based advertising.
WLAN 
WLAN (Wireless LAN) technologies are designed to transmit and receive data over the
air, thus minimizing the need for wired communications over short distances. WLAN
may either take the form of an extension to an existing LAN or act as a substitute for a
wired LAN. WLANs have the beneﬁts of reduced costs due to the elimination of
unnecessary cables while also offering easy, ﬂexible network access. 
Because WLANs can provide high data rates (theoretically up to 54 Mb/s), at a cost
lower than that available using mobile networks, they will complement mobile net-
works and even have the potential to supplant them in certain speciﬁc data application
areas. The typically cited example is that of the business traveler in an airport. Because
of their limited range of approximately 100 meters, WLANs are not, however, in gen-
eral suitable for wide area coverage.
To date, WLANs have been installed in several tens of thousands of hotspots and other
locations worldwide, including airports, hotels, cafes, malls, exhibition centers, confer-
ence centers and others. Even some cities are considering providing WLAN-based
wide area coverage. Increasing numbers of businesses are installing WLAN hotspots in
libraries, conference rooms and customer information centers. Moreover, WLANs will
play a signiﬁcant role in mobile business solutions, offering an additional communica-
tion network for workforces, customers and partners alike. In such applications, how-
ever, the security issue is crucial and must be considered carefully. 
The WLAN standard is based on the 802.11 LAN standards. The institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) formed its 802.11 WLAN working group in 1990.

2.2 Network evolution 
23
This was set up with the aim of developing a global standard for wireless LAN. How-
ever, since then, many different and sometimes partially incompatible variants have
emerged.
The ﬁrst standard to be introduced and the one in most widespread use is 802.11b. This
operates in the license-free 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum, providing a maximum data
rate of 11 Mbit/s. A further evolution within the same frequency spectrum which offers
upward compatibility to 802.11b is the 802.11g standard with a maximum data rate of
54 Mb/s. Its deployment level has grown ever since it ﬁrst arrived on the scene and
most vendors today deliver WLAN network cards and access points which offer com-
patible support for both standards. 
The more recent 802.11a standard (products available since 2002) operates in the
license-free 5.2 GHz frequency spectrum. Although it also provides maximum data
rates of 54 Mb/s, it is incompatible with the 802.11b/g standards. This standard has the
advantage of providing more non-overlapping channels, thus resulting in higher band-
width capacity with multiple concurrent users in one WLAN cell. However, the disad-
vantage is that the corresponding frequency bands have not been released in some
countries.
It is important to note that the maximum data rates cannot be achieved in the real
world. Depending on the distance separating the device from the access point and on
the number of concurrent users (should be less than 20) in a cell, the actual transmis-
sion rates may well be only 10% of the maximum rates. 
There are other important WLAN standards, such as WEP, WPA and 802.11i. These
address security issues and are discussed in more detail in chapter 6.
The Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) [2.2.5] tests 802.11 products to
ensure interoperability. Products that comply with the speciﬁcation feature the ‘WiFi’
logo. 
Bluetooth
Bluetooth was initiated in 1994 by a study conducted by Ericsson and has been actively
promoted from 1998 onwards by the Special Interest Group (SIG). The SIG was set up
by Ericsson, Nokia, Intel, IBM, and Toshiba. Since its inception, several hundred other
companies have become members. 
Bluetooth, which has been in more widespread use since 2002, is a low-power radio
technology that is being developed to replace cables and infrared links over distances
of up to 10 meters. Devices such as PCs, printers, mobile phones and PDAs can be
linked together to communicate and exchange data via a wireless transceiver that ﬁts on
a single chip. 
Key Bluetooth applications include the synchronization of different items of equip-
ment, e.g. mobile phone, PDA, and PC. This will make it possible to enter data at any
one of the devices used and then synchronize the others with it. Additionally, data
exchange (for example, with POS (Point of Sale) terminals), ticketing or e-wallet appli-
cations for mobile commerce might also boost the success of Bluetooth. Bluetooth

2 Evolution of information and communication technologies
24
technology enables any device with a chip to communicate seamlessly even through
non-metallic walls or other intervening objects.
Using Bluetooth, it will be possible to separate a mobile phone’s transceiver unit from
the earpiece and the display. Thus, the transceiver could be housed in the user’s belt
buckle and the display in the watch with no wires needed. Bluetooth provides some of
the key functionalities required in order to transform a mobile phone into a comprehen-
sive lifestyle tool.
Since Bluetooth has a throughput of up to 1 Mbit/s (in real operation, 400 - 700 kb/s)
and is not limited to point-to-point links, it might also be used in wireless LAN appli-
cations. Easy connections make it possible to set up ad hoc networks. For instance, par-
ticipants at a meeting can create a so-called piconet in order to share documents. More-
over, a Bluetooth device can serve as a short-range (about 10 meters) Internet bridge
that enables others to connect to it in order to access Internet content. 
Different Bluetooth proﬁles have been deﬁned in order to provide interoperability
between devices. Proﬁles indicate which functionalities are supported by a device, and
devices that possess the same proﬁles can communicate.
Nonetheless, compatibility and security issues still hinder wider deployment of the
technology in business solutions. (For more details, see chapter 6). 
The Bluetooth standards are speciﬁed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group [2.2.6].
Scope of mobile network technologies
The mobile networks that have been outlined above constitute a comprehensive set of
complementary network technologies that cover the full spectrum from short-range
technologies (Bluetooth, WLAN) through to globally deployed technologies (GSM,
GPRS) as illustrated in ﬁgure 2.4. 
Figure 2.4 Scope of mobile network technologies 

2.3 Mobile device evolution
25
The foregoing should have made it clear that all of the network technologies that have
emerged in recent years are characterized by different focuses and parameters in terms
of bandwidth, quality of service, standards, range, costs, and services. Though some
technologies may compete with others and their areas of application may overlap, for
example Bluetooth and WLAN deployment in buildings or UMTS and WLAN in met-
ropolitan areas, complementarity is the keyword. This means that all of these technolo-
gies will remain established for the foreseeable future. 
Moreover, we can identify a clear tendency towards convergence on IP networks and
Internet protocols for these networks. This convergence is the only answer to increas-
ing network complexity and is driven primarily by considerations of economy and the
advantage of seamless communication. The digitization of any content, such as text,
data, voice, graphic, picture, video, multimedia, is an important step towards a uniﬁed
network and will help drive the convergence process. Technologies such as voice over
IP and the implementation of IP protocol stacks within a variety of access technologies
will make this development unavoidable.
Although the goal of seamless communication with any device over any network to
access any service is a greatly prized objective, it will not be achievable in the near
future. However, the different network protocols, shortcomings in roaming capabilities,
and device limitations may be overcome in the longer term.
Readers who want to ﬁnd comprehensive coverage of the topic of mobile networks in
order to learn more about their technical basis are recommended to refer to the book:
GPRS and 3G wireless applications: Professional developer’s guide [2.2.7].
2.3 Mobile device evolution
The development of mobile devices has a number of predecessors: pagers, unwieldy
analog mobile phones, portable PCs and others where development has been acceler-
ated by the availability of network infrastructures and the miniaturization of electronic
components. 
Nowadays, mobile devices such as mobile phones, smartphones and PDAs count
amongst the technologically most highly advanced products because they integrate a
range of the most recent developments, such as processor, radio frequency, memory,
display, battery, voice recognition and software technologies. The software input is par-
ticularly impressive, now accounting for approximately 70% of a mobile phone’s value
chain. In less than three years, the lines of code implemented in a typical mobile phone
have quadrupled from around one million to over four million.
The combination of these rapidly developing technologies coupled with the increas-
ingly exacting wishes and demands of leisure and business users has resulted in the
appearance of a huge range of new devices over the last two years as the examples in
ﬁgure 2.5 demonstrate.

2 Evolution of information and communication technologies
26
The list of device categories stretches from fashion mobile phones, via simple mobile
phones (WAP), business-oriented smartphones, PDAs, clamshell handhelds, laptops,
tablet PCs, webpads to car navigation systems. 
The most exciting developments in the near future will be seen in the ﬁeld of fashion
phones, smartphones and PDAs.
An example of the fashion category is the Siemens’ Xelibri family. These handsets are
designed to appeal to fashion-conscious users and to be displayed as items of personal
jewelry rather than traditional mobile telephones. Typically, such devices feature 4096
color screens, voice dialing technology and polyphonic ringtones. They dispense with
a keypad altogether, relying on voice dialing and navigation buttons to operate the
phone’s features and FM radio equipment. Some are shaped like a clip, allowing them
to be fastened to an item of clothing; others are supplied with a ‘cargo-style’ clip to be
attached to the waistband of the user’s trousers. 
In contrast, smartphones and PDAs will play a signiﬁcant role in future business solu-
tions.
Smartphones like the 6600 from Nokia or SX1 from Siemens use the open Symbian-
based Series 60 operating system which offers the downloading of mobile applications,
enhanced XHTML browsers for integrated access to web and WAP sites, and advanced
PIM (Personal Information Management) applications. Usually such devices possess
additional multimedia features, such as video download and play capabilities, and cam-
corder features. Moreover, these devices boast integrated Bluetooth as well as multi-
band capabilities, e.g. GSM, GPRS and HSCSD or GSM, GPRS and UMTS. 
The competition in this device category will remain intense, involving vendors from
Europe (Nokia, Siemens), the USA (Motorola) and Asia (Samsung, SonyEricsson) to
Figure 2.5 The wide range of new mobile devices

2.3 Mobile device evolution
27
name only the leading companies. Series 60 is the dominant operating system in this
smartphone device class with a market share of about 75%. The other player whose
importance in this sector is probably growing is Microsoft with its Windows Mobile
(for smartphones) operating system (More details can be found in chapter 4). 
As a device class, PDAs have developed in two main areas: networking and the expan-
sion of interfaces and features. Unlike their counterparts of two years ago, today’s
PDAs possess integrated network modules, mostly Bluetooth and WLAN or GPRS, or
can accommodate network interface cards. Newer models are capable of communicat-
ing via Bluetooth, WLAN and GPRS networks. An increasing number of devices, such
as Toshiba’s e800 series, provide Voice over IP capability, which enables users to place
phone calls over a high-speed WLAN network, thus reducing the cost of long-distance
calls. 
Thanks to the availability of a variety of interface cards such as network interface, GPS
(Global Positioning System) or camera interface cards, memory cards, smartcards,
SIM cards, keyboard interfaces, MP 3 player interfaces, etc., PDAs may be conﬁgured
in many ways for various leisure and business purposes. 
This category has also been characterized by keen competition for a number of years.
The leading vendors are HP, Palm, Handspring, Sony, Toshiba, Fujitsu Siemens, and
Dell. The dominant operating systems are Palm OS from Palmsource and Microsoft’s
Windows Mobile (for Pocket PCs). However, alongside Linux, RIM (Research in
Motion, a Canadian company) is also attempting to boost the market share claimed by
its Blackberry operating system (For more details, see chapter 4).
It is interesting to observe the increasing rate of convergence of the functions and fea-
tures of smartphones and PDAs. Undoubtedly smartphones currently offer better voice
capabilities. On the other hand, however, PDAs provide a larger number of interfaces.
In fact, smartphone growth has outstripped that of PDAs. As component integration
intensiﬁes, the more likely it is that attractive smartphones with different form factors
will emerge.
Within the context of mobile business solutions and the access to sensitive enterprise
resources from mobile devices, appropriate security features will play an increasingly
vital role. Security considerations are discussed in chapter 6.

3 Forward-looking e-business solution 
architecture 
Enterprises today run their businesses on the basis of architectures and applications that
usually consist of a mix of heterogeneous software and hardware technologies sourced
from different vendors. Today’s applications therefore offer only very little capability
in terms of interoperability.
In the past, enterprises made large-scale investments in best-of-breed products to sup-
port the functional requirements of their business processes. In the meantime, however,
they have grown disillusioned and have increased the pressure on their IT organizations
to reduce costs, increase ﬂexibility and, in the ﬁnal analysis, create value for their busi-
ness. 
This situation forces IT organizations to manage a high degree of heterogeneity in
order to meet their companies’ requirements. In addition, CIOs need to migrate enter-
prises’ IT infrastructures to forward-looking e-business solution architectures if they
are to make their businesses adaptable and capable of developing new and innovative
cross-functional business processes.
The good news is that vendors have recognized the seriousness of this situation and,
more than ever before, are now driving the development of technical and business
standards to reduce the friction between products.
The following sections provide an overview of the fundamental elements of a forward-
looking architecture and the way they work together in modern business solutions.
3.1 Application development 
Application development is an important facet of the design and development of busi-
ness solutions. Visual GUI (Graphical User Interface) builders are available for devel-
oping user interfaces. These permit the deﬁnition of the layout as well as the control
and output elements based on drag-and-drop mechanisms without the need for explicit
coding. Technologies that support mobile terminals are starting to play an increasingly
important role in this context. Visual tools are also available to support the implemen-
tation of database accesses or web services.

3.1 Application development

Development environments are frequently optimized for speciﬁc operating systems.
Suitable development environments are also available for special middleware, such as
Microsoft’s .NET and IBM’s WebSphere. IBM’s Eclipse development environment has
been available as an open source framework since 2003. Taking Eclipse as their basis,
other software vendors have now optimized their development tools for their speciﬁc
environments. A well-known example is SAP’s decision to use Eclipse as the Java
development tool for its NetWeaver platform. As a result, Eclipse can now be consid-
ered more or less to be the standard development environment in the Java world.
In contrast, Microsoft offers the proprietary Visual Studio.NET development environ-
ment which is designed for Microsoft platforms only. However, it is rated by experts as
the best and most efﬁcient development tool available today.
Modern development environments can generally be integrated easily with software
modeling and test tools in order to provide a standard environment that offers consis-
tent support for the application development process.
3.1.1 Component-based software development
In the late 1980s, programmers and information technology (IT) professionals began to
realize that large software development projects not only entailed excessive overhead
but were also inﬂexible. Most enterprise applications were written for a speciﬁc set of
tasks and the resulting code could not be repurposed for other jobs. Consequently, even
related applications had to be coded from scratch. 
Design experts and programmers therefore began to turn to object-oriented program-
ming, a modular approach that formalized the idea of reusable code. Object-oriented
programming enabled programmers to link reusable code objects together within a sin-
gle application for the ﬁrst time. The introduction of component software models fol-
lowed. Component software models applied object-oriented programming principles
between applications with the result that developers could create applications by
assembling discrete components.
These models made it possible to achieve the main objective: the modularization of
complex applications in order to boost ﬂexibility and efﬁciency.
Component technology allows application development to be tailored in a concrete
way to business processes. Functionalities are encapsulated in components and these
are assembled in an application as illustrated in a simpliﬁed way in ﬁgure 3.1.
To support a speciﬁc business process, an application executes and controls a sequence
of components, named business objects. The way the business objects are deployed is
deﬁned by the deployment description associated with each of them. They are stored
and administrated in a business object directory and processed in the runtime system’s
business object container (part of the application server). 
Components from existing applications can also be used for new solutions. The presen-
tation and business logic as well as resource management are strictly separated from
one another and no longer bound to any speciﬁc application. The strict separation of
components means that parts of applications can be combined or extended in different

3 Forward-looking e-business solution architecture 
30
ways. Communication is performed on the basis of a small number of standards and
interfaces that are accepted industry-wide.
Component technology offers some signiﬁcant advantages:
– Reduced time and costs due to the reusability of components
– Reduced complexity by splitting complex applications into modular functional com-
ponents
– Reduced development risk thanks to the possibility of creating and then subse-
quently extending partial solutions
– Better quality through the use of proven components
– Increased ﬂexibility through the substitution of components within a system envi-
ronment
For more information about component-based application development, readers are
recommended to consult the book ‘IT-Lösungen im e-Business’ [3.1.1].
3.1.2 The two camps
Ever since the advent of component technology, two camps have led the market. The
resulting competition has proved to be of great value by motivating alternating
enhancements of the competing concepts.
The camps are, on the one hand, Microsoft with the .NET framework and, on the other,
the Java world with the J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) / Enterprise Java-
Beans (EJBs) model. This second camp is headed by Sun and supported by major soft-
ware vendors such as IBM, HP, BEA, Oracle, SAP, to name only a few.
The Java camp’s goal is to allow customers to choose between vendors’ products and
tools and to encourage best-of-breed products to emerge through competition. Sun ini-

tiated the Java Community Process (JCP) in order to solicit new ideas. Java technology
is based on open speciﬁcations for which various vendors then supply the necessary
products. In this way, the Java standard offers companies independence from individual
vendors. The J2EE architecture is based solely on the Java programming language
and, once written, Java code can be deployed on any J2EE-compliant platform. 
Microsoft .NET, on the other hand, is a proprietary technology. However, Microsoft has
the advantage that it does not have to compromise with others and can closely couple
various functions of the .NET runtime environment with the Windows operating sys-
tem. Because optimum use can be made of the underlying operating system (Win-
dows), it is believed that comparable applications would run more efﬁciently under
.NET.
Conceptually, the J2EE and .NET application environments are very similar as ﬁgure
3.2 demonstrates.
Both are based on a virtual machine, a neutral intermediate code and a uniform class
library. In terms of architecture, both technologies are designed for server-based pro-
cessing for different front-ends such as web browsers, GUI clients and mobile termi-
nals. Support is provided for GUI (Swing versus Windows Forms), for HTML genera-
tion (Java server pages versus ASP.NET), data access (JDBC versus ADO.NET), XML,
and web services. The respective application servers offer parallel processing, session
and transaction management, as well as adapters for databases and third-party systems.
When developing the .NET technology, Microsoft had the advantage of being able to
use proven Java concepts, thus resulting in the creation of a technically more modern
solution. This can be seen both in the C# programming language and in the consistent
integration of web technologies and XML. Furthermore, as far as data access is con-
cerned, Microsoft’s ADO.NET offers a greater level of comfort than is available with
JDBC. On the other hand, the Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) component model is meth-
odologically more advanced than COM+, which was adopted in Microsoft .NET for
the provision of enterprise services and managed components. As mentioned above, the
Figure 3.2 Java/J2EE environment versus .NET framework

3 Forward-looking e-business solution architecture 
32
competition between these two concepts has been of beneﬁt to users and the best fea-
tures have been offered in new versions alternatively in both the .NET and the Java
model. 
The real differences between Microsoft’s .NET and J2EE tend to lie at the strategic
level. Java is an open technology platform which both extends over all operating sys-
tems and embraces a variety of alternative vendors. It is important here that there are
attractive open source products available for all components of Java technology. These
products, for example from the Apache Group, are not only cheap but also powerful
and stable. In the case of Microsoft .NET, the fact that the technology comes from one
source means that new functions can be developed quickly. However, dependence on
the vendor is absolute.
3.1.3 XML – the Lingua Franca of the Internet
The emergence of XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which developed out of
HTML and the document-oriented SGML (Structured Generalized Markup Language)
and which permits information-oriented data processing on the web, will be one of the
most important technological developments for future business solutions. 
XML is a unique attempt to provide the comprehensive communication, presentation
and processing of any data. It is an attempt to standardize, packetize, structure, and
translate information so that it can be presented on different devices and make the stor-
age, retrieval and exchange of all types of information more efﬁcient and more respon-
sive to real human and organizational needs.
As a meta-language, XML is more than just a tool for the semantic structuring of infor-
mation in documents. With XML, it is also possible to create languages which stand-
ardize the processing of all types of information, such as the presentation of data
(style), data transfer, access by applications to the information structure, the descrip-
tion of relationships between data and data modules (hyperlinks, addresses), or com-
munication between applications. Many languages that support the processing of XML
data are derived from XML itself.
XML is the future of the web and is often referred to as its lingua franca. The decisive
factor is that XML can be tailored completely to respond to users’ needs, the character-
istics of the information they want to work with and, ﬁnally, the speciﬁc objectives of
the application.
At the same time, this huge potential represents a great threat to the success of XML.
XML is not a solution but rather a tool for developing solutions. These solutions are as
good or bad as the concepts behind them.
Development is proceeding rapidly and gathering pace. For many sectors and branches
of industry, speciﬁc formats (Document Type Deﬁnitions, schemes) have already been
established which enable and optimize the access to and interchange and processing of
homogeneous information. Examples of some of the important bodies engaged in this
work are ebXML [3.1.2], OASIS [3.1.3] and RosettaNet [3.1.4].

3.1 Application development 
33
XML is a globally recognized industry standard and is recommended by W3C [3.1.5].
More information about XML can be found at XML.Org [3.1.6].
To illustrate the ﬂexibility of XML deployment, ﬁgure 3.3 depicts two scenarios.
The upper scenario shows how different output formats can be generated from a single
XML document source.
XML has a complementary technology, known as XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Lan-
guage), which offers both a method for formatting XML information and altering or
even transforming XML documents by means of pattern matching and template-based
transformations.
XML stylesheets together with an XSL processor can be used to transform any XML
document into a presentable form on any device.
A stylesheet contains a set of tree-construction rules consisting of two components, the
ﬁrst being a pattern matched against the elements in the source tree and the second a
template that constructs a portion of the result tree. The stylesheet contains a template
of the desired result structure and identiﬁes data in the source document to insert into
this template.
The XSL processor works through the nodes of an XML document tree. First, it exam-
ines which rules apply to the root element. It then searches for possible child elements
and rules that might apply to each child and continues this process through the tree.
Figure 3.3 XML deployment scenarios

3 Forward-looking e-business solution architecture 
34
The lower scenario in ﬁgure 3.3 shows how an XML document can be processed by an
application.
The vocabulary and syntax are deﬁned in DTDs (Document Type Deﬁnitions) or
schemes that may form an industry-speciﬁc vocabulary and can also contain program
type deﬁnitions for the data. In order to reference a publicly available XML scheme, a
reference URL may be inserted in the XML document. This URL points to the refer-
enced schemes and functions as a dictionary. 
The XML document can then be analyzed, evaluated and further processed using a
software parser. Furthermore, XML technology is currently being enhanced by pro-
gramming APIs such as DOM (Document Object Model, tree-oriented) and SAX (Sim-
ple API for XML, event-oriented) as well as by further concepts such as XLink, XPath,
XPointer [3.1.7].
One example of such a scenario would be a situation in which an electronics company
has to design a new component for a product, with all the product-related information
being stored in a database. The product information now has to be made available to all
the partners, each of which possesses a different merchandise system. The solution can
be implemented by means of an SQL statement that extracts the data from the product
database, uses the table column headings as tags and thus automatically generates an
XML document. The XML document is then transferred to a document conversion pro-
gram that can use mapping rules to generate other document formats. 
XML Web Services
From the very outset, the creation of XML has been a vendor-neutral, standards-driven
effort to deﬁne a markup language that can be used for a multitude of purposes, includ-
ing the exchange of data between multiple systems. 
Taking the XML standard as the starting point, the modular nature of XML Web Ser-
vices can be seen as the next logical step in application development. 
To enable the program-to-program communications that deﬁne web services, addi-
tional speciﬁcations were needed in order to deﬁne the services, the interfaces to the
services, and a mechanism for invoking the services.
Although advanced component models such as J2EE/EJB and Microsoft’s .NET
Object Model have enjoyed widespread acceptance within companies, extended com-
ponent models that enable components to work across networks have been less suc-
cessful. This is mainly due to two factors: 
– The incompatibility of the two camps’ frameworks. The two component-based
frameworks use different platforms and a different scheme to communicate. An
J2EE application cannot communicate easily with one based on the .NET architec-
ture.
– Given that companies’ security policies usually require that their ﬁrewalls block the
type of network services used by software components, the two component-based
frameworks cannot be used successfully on an inter-enterprise basis. 

3.2 Multitier application architecture
35
To overcome these problems, IBM, Microsoft, Ariba, HP, and Sun started to lay the
groundwork for web services in the late 1990s. The companies embraced two estab-
lished standards, XML running on top of HTTP, as the foundation for inter-component
communication and deﬁned additional speciﬁcations that describe the services, the
interfaces to the services, and a mechanism for invoking the services. In acknowledg-
ment of the XML standard, these services often are referred to as XML Web Services.
The three XML standards crucial to XML web services are the Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP), the Web Services Description Language (WSDL), and Universal
Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI). Microsoft and IBM have led the
development of all three. All the protocols are multivendor speciﬁcations upon which
vendors base their XML web services frameworks. An XML web service may be writ-
ten in any language and run on any platform, as long as it conforms to these basic XML
web service standards. More details about web services standards and the service-ori-
ented architecture (SOA) can be found in chapter 5. 
3.2 Multitier application architecture
The objective of an enterprise-wide application architecture is to develop applications
in conformity with guidelines that enable them to communicate and cooperate with
each other more efﬁciently, have a common look and feel, and can be deployed on dif-
ferent platforms.
As depicted in ﬁgure 3.4, modern application architectures are subdivided into four
layers: the communication/presentation tier, the business logic tier, the integration
tier, and the services/resources tier. 
Figure 3.4 Multitier application architecture

3 Forward-looking e-business solution architecture 
36
Applications developed on the basis of this four-layer model have a modular structure
and are distributed, open, ﬂexible, adaptable and extensible. Consequently, they can be
adapted more easily to the structures of modern business processes, i. e. it is possible to
respond quickly to new requirements.
However, such a multitier application architecture requires careful application and sys-
tem design. Monolithic programs are replaced by groups of specialized, loosely cou-
pled, interaction-capable components that can be placed on different systems and plat-
forms while taking account of technical and operational aspects.
Some of the essential attributes of a modern, enterprise-wide application architecture
for the design and implementation of business solutions are:
– The separation of the application into different layers: for presentation; business
logic; integration; and enterprise resources, services and data storage (multitier
architecture) 
– The use of web browsers and micro-browsers (for mobile devices) as primary user
interfaces that support the relevant standards such as HTTP/HTML and WAP/WML
– The use of protocols and data formats based on de facto standards and/or Internet
standards 
– The use of XML as a universal format for data interchange and as the basis for busi-
ness process communication between companies in the form of XML web services 
– The use of component technologies 
– The deployment of dedicated, function-optimized server technologies such as web
servers, portal servers, application servers, integration servers, database servers and
directory servers 
– The integration of mobile application technologies
The communication tier (often called presentation tier) is primarily responsible for the
terminal-speciﬁc communication and presentation of information contents. It must
make the information volume available in a suitable form to the user and must respond
appropriately to input from the user. The communication/presentation tier covers the
system building blocks Web Server and Mobile Access.
Web server
A Web Server typically transmits web pages on demand via HTTP to a web browser
(PC client). In order to perform this task, a web server possesses special, system-
related software modules, such as a module for monitoring communication channels
and for analyzing and interpreting the incoming URL command line. The primary tasks
of a web server include:
– Implementing simple business logic with server-based scripting technologies, such
as Microsoft Active Server Page (ASP) or Java Server Page (JSP)
– Accessing business data (e.g. database)
– Preparing HTML data streams and transferring the web pages that are to be dis-
played for interpretation by the web browser (client). Program code can also be
optionally transferred for execution at the client.

3.2 Multitier application architecture
37
The technologies used most frequently for generating web pages include:
– Java Server Page (.jsp) and Java Servlets within the J2EE environment
– Active Server Page.NET (.aspx) within the Microsoft environment
The web applications running on web servers do far more than just return information
in HTML format. They may also contain business logic, access databases, prepare data
for speciﬁc browsers and/or deliver components to the client to enable part of the busi-
ness logic to be executed at the terminal (e.g. in a Java virtual machine).
Mobile access
A range of protocols has been developed for mobile terminals in parallel with those
that characterize the Internet. WAP stands for Wireless Application Protocol and is an
open standard for data access and communication with mobile devices. The protocol is
independent of the transport network and the actual terminal. It takes account of differ-
ent displays, optimizes the presentation format and communicates with WAP browsers
(micro-browser) in the mobile device. In addition, WAP ensures effective communica-
tion within a limited bandwidth and supports mobile radio networks such as GSM,
GPRS and UMTS. WML (Wireless Markup Language) was developed as a description
language for presentation.
A Mobile Access building block usually contains a WAP gateway that is responsible for
the content of the information that is to be exchanged with mobile terminals such as
mobile phones. It converts HTML or other data formats and stores or creates WML
data formats. WML documents may either be retrieved in this format from storage, or
may be generated at runtime from XML documents in a form appropriate for the termi-
nal in question, for example through transcoding procedures or by means of the XML
Stylesheet Language (XSL).
A WAP gateway represents the point of connection between the mobile radio and Inter-
net worlds and is responsible for converting the mobile radio protocol to the Internet
protocol and vice versa. 
Thus, for example, it converts input from WAP terminals, which is available in a
binary/compressed protocol, to the HTTP protocol and converts the Wireless Data-
gram Protocol (WDP) to the Transmission Control Protocol (IP/TCP). Nowadays,
WAP gateway functions are often included in portal server products and represent an
important part of the communication/presentation tier.
Other mobile devices such as PDAs and smartphones sometimes implement the WAP
protocols but frequently use only HTML and TCP/IP. Furthermore, certain other
mobile phones support the i-mode protocol which is based on packet transmission and
uses a kind of compact HTML.
The core building blocks
The services and resource tier comprises the legacy systems, corporate services such as
e-mail and directory services, and the enterprise’s databases and web content servers.

3 Forward-looking e-business solution architecture 
38
These resources are based, to a greater or lesser extent, on established technologies and
are not discussed in more detail here. 
In contrast, the Portal Server, Application Server and Integration Server – i.e., the core
building blocks of forward-looking application architectures – have undergone signiﬁ-
cant developments over recent years. Their underlying architectures and features will
therefore be highlighted in the following sections.
3.2.1 Portal server
In many enterprises, portals are developing into the central entry point for all business-
relevant information and workﬂows, including the handling of transactions across a
very wide range of business processes. The users of such portals are customers, busi-
ness partners, vendors and the enterprise’s own employees.
Enterprise portals frequently combine different enterprise tasks within a single portal,
such as customer portal, broker portal, ﬁeld service portal, internal services portal, sup-
plier portal, editor portal, etc. They have also become a key element in enterprise-wide
integration (people integration) and have acquired interoperability with other vendors’
platforms and applications. 
Portal servers suitable for use as enterprise portals must be capable of continuous adap-
tation to a very wide range of enterprise and user requirements. Consequently, this key
building block in modern solutions demands, in particular, a modern, ﬂexible, forward-
looking architecture. The basic requirements for suitable portals are a scalable infra-
structure, high availability and ﬂexible presentation services, as well as support for
mobile terminal devices. Other important portal functions are the assurance of a high
level of security through adequate authentication and access control mechanisms,
together with easy-to-use personalization facilities which permit optimization both for
Figure 3.5
Portal server architecture

3.2 Multitier application architecture
39
the enterprise and the users of the portal. Portal servers are embedded in the existing IT
environment and comprise services as shown in ﬁgure 3.5.
In the actual product variants offered by the various vendors, the portal server is fre-
quently a component of an application server family, with the application server acting
as both runtime environment and backbone for the transaction processing carried out
over the portal. Existing implementations from leading vendors are all based on Java
standards (J2EE, EJB etc.) and are largely independent of hardware and software plat-
forms (with the exception of Microsoft).
Today’s most successful portals offer the technologies and generic services described
below.
Portal engine, presentation services
The technological kernel of a portal server is the portal engine. The portal engine ana-
lyzes incoming requests and starts up appropriate components, whose function is to
provide the results in the form of portlets. Portlets are the visible components which
users see on their portal pages. On the basis of the page layout, the portlets are grouped
together in the assigned frames and then displayed. The page structure is normally
deﬁned in template ﬁles (Java Server Pages Markups) which can be ﬂexibly adapted
and modiﬁed. The pages are built by the presentation services, which take account,
wherever appropriate, of the requesting user’s authorizations and personal parameters
as well as of the characteristics of the terminal device in question.
Users prefer to work with a simple, web-based user interface, if possible with intuitive
navigation and access to all the applications they need to perform their tasks. Separate
web servers or servers integrated in the portal supply the corresponding portal informa-
tion in HTML format to browser-based devices. Frames containing the requested or
conﬁgured content (portlets) are typically supplied with a navigation bar and links to
lower-level pages. Portal contents may be drawn from different sources, e.g. catalogs,
documents, sales reports, address lists, appointment diaries, worklists and ticker bars. 
The use of mobile terminal devices (laptops, PDAs, Internet-capable mobile phones) in
business processes (especially B2E and B2C) will increase sharply in the future. Mod-
ern portal servers take account of this trend through integrated transcoding and render-
ing procedures (part of the presentation services) which manage the device-speciﬁc
processing of the presented content. Portals must thus be able to identify device
classes, and possibly also device types, in order to ensure the required presentation and
interaction.
User management
The user management function has the task of administering the various user groups
together with the assigned roles and authorizations. User administration stores the user
and role-speciﬁc information that is needed for each business process. Users are able to
log onto the portal and administer their preferences and account information them-
selves. Alternatively, existing information can be integrated into the portal server. Users
and roles are normally stored as information in the portal server and are synchronized

3 Forward-looking e-business solution architecture 
40
with existing directories via LDAP. These directories often also contain access privi-
leges and certiﬁcates which are monitored and administered by a CIO and used by the
security systems. As organizations, roles and authorizations change frequently, it is
important that the relevant management system should be administratively simple,
ﬂexible and secure. 
Personalization services
The personalization services make a considerable contribution to the usefulness of
enterprise portals. From the user’s point of view, settings regarding portal content and
device-speciﬁc settings play an important role, as do also preferences of various kinds,
the selection of information channels, the enabling and disabling of notiﬁcation ser-
vices, etc. From the enterprise’s point of view, user proﬁles, rules and authorizations
play an important role in various situations. From the information provider’s perspec-
tive, customer proﬁles can be generated from customers’ navigation and purchasing
behavior and items that are of interest to individual customers can be displayed to them
at runtime. 
Personalization and simple menu guidance are of particular importance in the case of
mobile devices since the constraints limiting these devices (small display screen, lim-
ited interaction) mean that users must be guided directly to the information that is rele-
vant to them.
Security services
Since the portal represents the central entry point for users with very different authori-
zation levels, security services form an essential component of enterprise portals. The
security system monitors the authentication and authorization of portal users and
enables encrypted and/or authenticated data transmission on request. It can also ensure
that transactions are of a binding nature.
In most applications today, authentication is performed by means of a user ID and
password. However, leading portal suppliers also offer public key infrastructure (PKI)
support coupled with the use of digital certiﬁcates for authentication and to ensure the
non-repudiability of transactions. As users have access to several independent applica-
tions via the portal servers, single sign-on functionality can be extremely useful. Here,
the user is given a ticket that is digitally signed by the portal server. Applications
(including 3rd party applications) can check this ticket against appropriate portal librar-
ies before allowing access. Portal servers also often provide interfaces to independent
authentication products (See chapter 6 for more details on single sign-on). 
Access by users and user groups is controlled through to portlet level by authoriza-
tions. The access control lists for the various portlets are deﬁned by administrators who
take account of any relevant provisions in the company’s security policy.
The complexity of end-to-end security implementation is frequently underestimated.
Secure transactions can only be guaranteed if end-to-end security exists. This applies
equally to terminal devices, networks, web servers/WAP gateways, portal and applica-
tion servers, and back-end systems (Chapter 6 provides more details).

3.2 Multitier application architecture
41
Knowledge management
The function of knowledge management is to ﬁnd and selectively read the structured or
unstructured information requested by users. Knowledge management covers aggrega-
tion, categorization, classiﬁcation, the distribution of any structured or unstructured
information, as well as simple and complex search functions. Company documents can
be stored in an appropriate sort order, while version control, procedures and ﬂow con-
trol are also of importance in connection with publication.
Integration services
The integration of existing applications and resources in the portal plays a crucial role.
The corresponding integration services may either be directly implemented in the por-
tal or the EAI components present in an existing integration server may be used. Access
to data/information or transactions frequently has to take account of back-end systems
and external systems and data sources. The retrieval and conversion mechanisms nec-
essary for this are provided by the integration services. These services provide standard
adapters in the form of portlets or remote portlets in order to access frequently used
information sources (e.g. Reuters), internal services (e.g. e-mail) or applications (e.g.
SAP).
Speciﬁc adapters (e.g. to legacy systems) can be added to the development components
of an application or integration server (J2EE, EJB, JSP, JCA). 
Other services
Even though portal servers generally possess a series of out-of-the-box functions, these
must be conﬁgured to match the enterprise’s task requirements and may be available in
a large number of different variants. It often takes several months to arrive at the opti-
mum set-up. Enterprises therefore expect a simple portal development environment
enabling them to develop their own portal components and thus react quickly and ﬂex-
ibly to market changes.
Depending on the supplier, other services may be provided by the portal in the form of
portal services. Foremost amongst these are the collaboration services. They offer
businesses improved cooperation across corporate boundaries and give distributed
project teams the opportunity to communicate synchronously and asynchronously, and
also to administer and edit documents jointly.
Other optional portal services include publishing services, alert and notiﬁcation ser-
vices and location-based services. The latter are particularly important to mobile users
of the portal.
As communication and information platforms become increasingly interlinked, a
closer interfacing between portal servers and help services will become necessary.
Nowadays, customers are contacted both via the Internet and via telephone channels.
Multichannel customer contacts, customer proﬁles and access to back-end applications
are relevant to both services, and their close integration is therefore a desirable objec-
tive.

42
Because of their interaction with knowledge management systems and the need to
administer web content, portal servers are often closely linked to content management
systems. However, content management functions are increasingly being incorporated
in portal servers.
3.2.2 Application server
An application server forms the centerpiece of a web-based business application. As
shown in ﬁgure 3.6, the basic function of the application server is to provide the run-
time environment for web applications. 
The application server provides containers to run the applications’ reusable software
components. Component technologies such as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) or
Microsoft COM+ components (in DNA environments), as well as .NET-managed com-
ponents in native .NET applications or in mixed environments (DNA and .NET), are in
widespread use today. 
The container has the task of providing the components with a runtime environment
through which they are invoked. Via the container, components indirectly use a set of
basic standardized infrastructure services. This model releases programmers from the
need to deal with complex system-related security, transaction and communication
issues, and hundreds of APIs. Instead programmers can focus on implementing the
pure business logic. 
This set of runtime services includes access to relational databases and unstructured
data, persistent management, management of queues for asynchronous communication
on the basis of application-speciﬁc messages, transaction management and execution,
access and user identiﬁcation veriﬁcation, and the auditable recording of all actions.
Figure 3.6
Application server architecture

3.2 Multitier application architecture

In addition to these runtime services, a professional application platform requires a
highly productive development environment, including support for reusable server-side
components. The advanced functions as far as application developers are concerned
include support for different programming languages, visual programming tools, code
debugging across distributed components, conﬁguration management and the integra-
tion of third-party tools.
Application servers also provide the runtime environment for other applications such
as packaged standard applications. Support for web services is partially implemented
in the leading products but is still undergoing development in the light of the standard-
ization process.
Above all, application servers must provide a high level of application scalability
because it is not possible to predict the number of concurrent users who will be using
the web application. Advanced application services such as dynamic load balancing
and automatic failover mechanisms in an application server cluster are therefore valu-
able features.
On the basis of the two above-mentioned component technologies, two rival applica-
tion server technologies or platforms have established themselves. These are Java
application servers such as IBM WebSphere or BEA WebLogic, on the one hand, and
Microsoft Windows Server-based COM applications and/or .NET applications on the
other. For older environments (DNA, Distributed Network Architecture), the Windows
2003 operating system family contains all the required application server functions in
the form of integrated application services. In addition, the .NET framework contains
all the required .NET Enterprise Services.
Java application servers are based on the speciﬁcations of Java 2 Enterprise Edition and
make available a range of middleware services and application programming interfaces
(APIs) for the implementation of business-critical Java-based web applications. The
most important middleware services and APIs in this context are:
– Java Server Pages (JSPs) for creating simple web applications (HTML instructions
are generated for the browser by means of a server-side script.) 
– JavaBeans for programming client-side components such as layout and navigation
elements for the user interface (browser) 
– Java Servlets for communicating with the integrated web server, and for program-
ming and controlling the processing logic 
– Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) for the use of reusable business logic components and
system-related runtime services 
– Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) for address translation and for saving
data and attributes in directories 
– Java Mail for sending and receiving electronic mail 
– Java Messaging Services (JMS) for asynchronous process communication (message
processing) by means of queues 
– Java Transaction Services and APIs (JTS/JTA) for transaction processing, including
the synchronized storage of data records in distributed databases

44
– Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) for access to databases by means of standard-
ized method calls 
– Java Connector Architecture (JCA) for the standards-based interconnection of cus-
tom web applications and application packages such as SAP, Siebel, etc. within the
framework of a company’s enterprise application integration (EAI) strategy 
– Java API for parsing XML documents (JAXP) 
– Support for synchronous process communication protocols (RMI via IIOP), CORBA
and XML web services.
3.2.3 Integration server
The integration server in new business process-oriented solutions represents an impor-
tant evolutionary step in modern business solutions. Integration servers intergrate func-
tional elements of standard application packages, newly developed business logic (e.g.
in the form of components), parts of legacy applications and the necessary data in a
way that responds to the needs of the business process that is being created.
The expression Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) has become established to
cover such issues and has recently been joined by the term Business Integration which
refers more broadly to the integration issues including business process modeling, exe-
cution and management. 
The task of business integration is to efﬁciently combine the various application pack-
ages which initially operate in isolation within a company. These packages consist of
Supply Chain Management (SCM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Cus-
tomer Relationship Management CRM), as well as user-deﬁned applications and data-
base and host applications. Business integration refers to the integration of business
processes at the inter-enterprise level, but also addresses cross-enterprise, B2B busi-
ness process integration issues, i.e. it deals with business relationships with suppliers,
partners and customers and access to electronic marketplaces.
A robust runtime environment in the form of a dedicated integration server is required
both for internal and for cross-enterprise business integration. Just as important as the
runtime environment is the development environment which, among other things, pro-
vides pre-integrated adapters for integrating back-end systems, generic business object
deﬁnitions, data transformation services and tools for business process modeling and
process ﬂow control.
Integration server technologies – as illustrated in ﬁgure 3.7 – can be logically subdi-
vided into three functional tiers. 
– Within the topology tier, hub-and-spoke (i.e. star-type coupling of applications) and
bus-oriented topologies can be distinguished. 
– The communication tier consists of the communication methods used for the integra-
tion, distinguished in data, applications and processes. The alternatives here are mes-
sage brokers (messaging, asynchronous, e.g. publish and subscribe), integration bro-
kers (RPC of business objects, synchronous, request/response) and web services
(request/response). 

3.2 Multitier application architecture
45
– The upper tier is concerned with the management and execution of integrated busi-
ness processes.
Tier 1 and, in particular, tier 2 have a major impact on the suitability of an integration
server for different integration requirements. Thus, integration brokers tend to be more
suitable for complex process integration. In such cases, however, intensive re-engineer-
ing work is usually required. Message brokers require less effort and are especially
suitable for message and data exchange as well as for separated, decentralized applica-
tions and processes. 
To some extent, web services combine the advantages of message brokers and integra-
tion brokers and are therefore now playing an increasingly important role in the ﬁeld of
business integration. This technology has other obvious advantages: open standards,
independence from the application platform and programming language together with
the loose coupling of applications run by different organizations and enterprises.
Nowadays, most integration servers contain web services frameworks and therefore
take account of this development.
Finally, tier 3, which is responsible for business process management, includes a pro-
cess modeling component and a workﬂow or business process engine, and constitutes
an important process integration function. It now features prominently in the concepts
proposed by all the leading suppliers.
Graphics-based process modeling tools make it possible to deﬁne workﬂows in simple
steps without any technical background knowledge. 
Workﬂow engines control the execution of individual activities, with web services or
incorporated existing applications representing the individual process steps. Activities
may also consist of interactions with humans. New processes are far easier to design
thanks to the separation of ﬂow control and function execution (applications), while
Figure 3.7

46
existing ones can be adapted more ﬂexibly than is possible using today’s prevalent
application structures.
Standards, of course, play a very important role in the ﬁeld of business integration since
efﬁcient integration and interoperability can only be achieved on the basis of standards
that are accepted industry-wide. Standardization bodies such as W3C, OASIS, ebXML
and the vendors (IBM, Microsoft, SAP, Sun, BEA, etc.) are continually extending the
range of standards. 
IBM and Microsoft are the most prominent motive forces in this ﬁeld and special men-
tion should be made here of the Global XML Web Services Architecture (GXA) and the
deﬁnition of the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) which is going to be
supported by all the relevant software vendors (For more information, see chapter 5).
High-value integration servers are now available from the major software vendors (e.g.
IBM WebSphere Business Integration, SAP Exchange Integration, or Microsoft Biztalk)
as well as from integration specialists such as Tibco and webMethods.
3.3 Cross-enterprise solution architectures
The integration of existing and future enterprise-wide and cross-enterprise business
processes together with the corresponding applications is currently one of the central
challenges facing companies. Whenever CIOs have to make decisions concerning soft-

47
ware investments and changes to their IT infrastructures they should keep in mind the
target architecture to which they want to migrate. Figure 3.8 illustrates just such an
architecture which includes cross-application, cross-enterprise, ﬂexible and adaptable
business solutions.
The cornerstone of this architecture is the application platform including the portal
server, the application server, the integration server and the resource and service tier as
explained in the previous sections. Running on this platform are standard applications
such as SCM, ERP, CRM together with industry-speciﬁc applications.
Such an architecture offers added value along multiple dimensions (cost, technology
independence, safeguarding of investments, reduced complexity, to name only a few).
However, the main advantages that deserve to be mentioned here are the ability to
implement pervasive cross-enterprise solutions as well as the capability to increase
productivity, ﬂexibility and competitiveness. This will be achieved by building auto-
mated processes and by adding services dynamically in order to react quickly to chang-
ing market requirements and incorporate mobile services that help achieve process
optimization. 
The key enabling technologies for tomorrow’s business solutions will be Mobility, Web
Services, and Security. 
Mobility
Mobile customers and employees using mobile devices can be reached anytime, any-
where and, in turn, may have access to the companies’ resources from any location. 
Enterprises may provide mobile services in order to streamline their employee-
involved processes, keep customers informed or to submit a suitable offer, whenever
and wherever appropriate.
Network operators may offer mobile services (e.g. multimedia services, location-based
services, administration services) to enterprises via the Internet or mobile networks in
order to support these enterprises with enhanced features and reduce costs.
Suppliers may support mobile ﬂeet management services in order to optimize their
delivery processes or may provide tracking services to check the delivery status of a
shipment or trace missing objects. 
These examples are merely a brief illustration of the ways in which mobile applications
enable enterprises to increase their competitiveness and secure enhanced beneﬁts.
Mobility is dealt with in greater detail in chapter 4.
Web services
Since the advent of XML web services about 4 years ago, most global software vendors
have embraced this technology. They now support it in their frameworks and products,
such as application servers, portal servers, integration servers, database systems or cli-
ent middleware, and offer the corresponding development tools. Web services consti-

3 Forward-looking e-business solution architecture 
48
tute the next stage in the development of component-based applications and have
become an integral part of modern application architectures.
Moreover, web services will play an important role in integrating applications within
an enterprise and this has been their primary task to date. The next step, however, will
bring about the integration of today’s still separate and, for the most part application-
speciﬁc, business processes, for example SCM or CRM processes. Web services tech-
nology, in conjunction with BPEL (Business Process Execution Language for web ser-
vices), makes it possible to deﬁne composite services which use elementary services
(web services) or existing applications, thus permitting the integration of processes or
the establishment of new ad hoc processes without the need for any knowledge of the
technical background. 
Based on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and HTTP, web services permit
interoperability beyond enterprises boundaries and help collaboration between, for
example, supplier’s processes and the corresponding enterprise processes. Using
SOAP, customers are also able to invoke the enterprise’s web services, while customer
processes may be built more efﬁciently by implementing web services at both sites.
The aim of the service-oriented architecture is to achieve the most technologically
advanced possible deployment of web services including the dynamic discovery, bind-
ing and deployment of web services published on the Internet. For more details about
SOA and web services, see chapter 5.
Security
Security has always been a top priority for e-business solutions. However, within the
framework of this future solution architecture, end-to-end security is not just a key pri-
ority. It is a vital precondition for the world of cross-company, distributed applications. 
The new challenges posed by wireless Internet access and the more extensive integra-
tion of mobile employees, partners and customers imply a substantial increase in the
associated risks. In addition, cross-boundary communication based on web services, as
well as the invocation of published web services and their integration in mission-criti-
cal business processes, opens up a new set of dangers for enterprises. 
Security awareness is the ﬁrst step in recognizing the real risks associated with busi-
ness processes and constitutes the starting point for the development of an appropriate
security strategy which balances security needs with affordable costs and acceptable
risks.
It is important to point out that the decisive factor behind the success of any cross-
enterprise solution is the trust that exists between all the involved partners. Conﬁdence
is the one thing above all that is needed if businesses are to compete successfully. How-
ever, conﬁdence is only possible if every participant knows that every business-related
interaction is totally secure.
In cross-enterprise architectures, security encompasses communication, messaging and
transactional services including conﬁdentiality, privacy, integrity, availability and non-
repudiation. For more details concerning security, see chapter 6.

3.3 Cross-enterprise solution architectures
49
Summary
Tomorrow’s business solutions will be based on an open, cross-enterprise architecture
which includes suppliers’, customers’ and employees’ processes as well as services
offered via the Internet. The key elements of this architecture are:
– Multitier architecture comprising the communication/presentation tier, the business
logic tier, the integration tier and the services/resource tier
– Application platform comprising the portal server, application server and integration
server
– Application platform that runs standard software, industry-speciﬁc software, home-
grown component-based applications, web services and mobile services
– Portal server that handles ﬁxed-line and mobile access by the different user groups
– Integration server that comprises message and integration brokers as well as business
process execution and management
– Interoperability with partner processes and services based on SOAP messages and
web services technology
– Embedded Internet services in business processes using SOAP and web services
technology
– Provision of comprehensive security services in order to achieve end-to-end security
for business processes

4 Mobile applications and platforms
More than 1.3 billion mobile phones are now in use worldwide and it is expected this
number will exceed 2 billion by 2008. However, the deﬁnition of future mobile appli-
cations needs to be considered much more comprehensively. Usually such applications,
which are distinguished from connection-oriented voice communications, are charac-
terized as connectionless, packetized data applications. Data, in this context, refers to
digitized data that may comprise structured data, unstructured data, voice and multi-
media.
The best-known of these applications, such as SMS (Short Message Services), MMS
(Multi Messaging Services), games, news, tickers, stock information, trafﬁc informa-
tion, e-mail, etc., are currently offered by mobile network operators. An increasing
number of enterprises recognize the value of mobile applications for their business
solutions. This chapter focuses on mobile applications within an enterprise perspective.
It covers the different application categories, the value-added, the application plat-
forms, while also presenting some examples of mobile applications.
4.1 Mobile application categories
A wide range of opportunities will be available for mobile information and services.
The use of mobile applications will include business-to-business (B2B), business-to-
employee (B2E) and business-to-consumer (B2C) models. From the user’s perspective,
some applications will be dedicated exclusively to business while others focus on lei-
sure or entertainment. Nonetheless, a fairly large number of applications will address
both the business and leisure sectors. 
The various mobile applications of value to users can be subdivided into application
classes as depicted in ﬁgure 4.1.
The application classes presented on the left of the diagram are typically deployed in
business solutions, while those on the right are mainly provided by network operators.
However this is a very rough classiﬁcation and in reality there is a considerable overlap
between classes. By way of an example, while network operators offer location ser-
vices enabling users to ﬁnd points of interest, e.g ATMs (Automatic Telling Machines),
banks may provide their customers with similar or additional services. These may not
only include how to ﬁnd the ATM closest to the customer’s location, but may also pro-
vide additional information about the speciﬁc services offered by the branch at which it
is installed. 

4.1 Mobile application categories
51
Mobile ofﬁce
is today’s most frequently used business application. It includes synchronization and
over-the-air access to personal information management (e.g. Microsoft Exchange –
Outlook, Lotus Notes) and interaction with back-ofﬁce systems. Appropriate devices
for exploiting such applications tend to take the form of PDAs with wireless connection
capability, although smartphones with the required display and input features are
becoming increasingly common in this area. The most important application is e-mail
with the ability to view attachments such as Word ﬁles and Excel spreadsheets.
Mobile Intranet applications
are essential in most mobile business solutions. These provide secure access to corpo-
rate applications such as travel management or to applications that employees need in
order to perform the tasks assigned to them, e.g. sales force automation. Other business
scenarios even allow partners or customers to access enterprise applications, services
or resources using mobile devices. The rapid increase in the use of Intranets and Extra-
nets is creating a mobile workforce that expects access to desktop applications, mes-
saging and information retrieval whether in the ofﬁce, in the car, waiting at transit loca-
tions such as airports, staying at a hotel, working at home or visiting a customer loca-
tion. Mobile workers are increasing at a rate of 60% per year and the number using
mobile applications is expected to reach 200 million by 2005.
Location-based services 
provide a new generic type of value-added for mobile device users in a variety of dif-
ferent situations, such as leisure (e.g. restaurant ﬁnder), emergencies (pharmacy, doc-
Figure 4.1 Mobile application classes

52
tor), commerce (shopping, ATM ﬁnder), convenience (route direction), monitoring or
business (customer or employee location, ﬂeet management). 
While the other applications listed in the diagram above are also available to a greater
or lesser extent in ﬁxed network environments and are therefore well-known, the loca-
tion-based services are unique and speciﬁc only to mobile networks. When used in con-
junction with push mode, mobile location-based services offer businesses and service
providers promising new opportunities for business. A few examples are:
– Points of interest: allow mobile users to request information relating to speciﬁc facil-
ities within their immediate environment (e.g. shopping areas, banks, hospitals, cin-
emas, ofﬁces, etc.).
– Instant couponing: matches the mobile user’s location and predeﬁned preferences
with retailer promotions to send the user an instant coupon. 
– Location ﬁnding: Mobile users are guided to requested targets or given route direc-
tions as a function of their current location.
– Tracking: Mobile objects are tracked and movements are traced in order to coordi-
nate activities and optimize processes.
– Travel services: Mobile users request or are notiﬁed of travel-related information
(e.g. ﬂight delays, trafﬁc jams) as a function of their current location. 
Mobile control and monitoring
includes a wide range of emergency, monitoring, surveillance, remote control, repair
and telematics applications which will make a genuine contribution towards simplify-
ing activities such as process control and will also help improve lifestyles, for example
by ﬂexibly monitoring people, places, properties, and environments for health, safety
and security-related events. Machine-to-machine telematics applications are expected
to constitute an important ﬁeld in the future. 
Mobile communication
is undoubtedly a mainstream application area, providing the mobile workforce and
consumers with additional options for communication, irrespective of their location
and desired contact partner. Options include text, voice, data, multimedia and synchro-
nous as well as asynchronous communication. For example, uniﬁed messaging pro-
vides users with a communication capability independent of device, time and location.
Mobile information services
can be of a very general, business-oriented or personalized nature. As the web has
shown, the range of information that can be provided is unlimited. Obviously, the value
of the information to the user increases as it becomes more personalized and localized.
Data can be pushed from or pulled to the mobile device. The more urgently information
is needed for making a decision (e.g. ﬂight delays), the more users are willing to pay.
Other examples of valuable information include events, festivals, attractions, directory
services, conversions of currency, weights, sizes, etc.

4.2 Value of mobile applications
53
Mobile commerce
includes all transaction-based applications such as ordering, purchasing, selling, auc-
tioning, trading, payment, banking, money transfer, brokering and ticketing. Mobile
commerce has huge potential and should be seen as an extension of e-commerce, but
one which will dramatically change both consumers’ lifestyles and the way service
providers and network operators run their businesses. High-level, end-to-end security is
essential for encouraging the use of this promising application.
Mobile entertainment 
is an application area which attracts mainly younger and mobile users. Games, for
example, are a proven way of drawing users to new applications and devices. Games
supplied by mobile devices not only make a wide selection of games available to peo-
ple but also make interactive games possible with any user around the world. Nokia’s
N-Gage devices will make this capability available to the mass market. The availability
of integrated cameras, MP3 players and video players in mobile devices will encourage
Internet-based music and video distribution and revive the debate concerning intellec-
tual property. 
It is an observed fact that younger users are early adapters of enhanced technologies.
The best example is SMS. It can therefore be expected that the use of video clips in
mobile devices will become popular among young people as soon as it is affordable.
Deployment for business purposes will follow later, but it is obvious that there are a
number of business applications that will make use of video services. Advertisements
will play an important role. For example, Coca Cola video ads could subsidize multi-
media messages. Another example is providing assistance to a ﬁeld engineer who has
the task of repairing a sophisticated machine. The engineer can obtain instructions
about how to mount a spare part from a video downloaded to his mobile device. 
Leisure and business are tending to become increasingly intermixed, particularly in
mobile scenarios. Infotainment, the mixture of information and entertainment is a new
way of attracting people and provides a good example of this trend. E-learning, for
instance, can start to become attractive to traveling employees when they use a mobile
device to watch a language lesson that features information concerning the major hits
currently showing in the city they are staying in.
4.2 Value of mobile applications
The main consideration motivating enterprises to drive the introduction of mobile
applications is the maintenance of their long-term competitive position and the genera-
tion of new revenue sources.
By way of example, the issue of competitiveness seen from the perspective of mobile
banking may be considered: although banks will not gain new customers by offering
mobile applications because every bank will be offering them, any bank which did not
provide such applications would risk losing customers.

4 Mobile applications and platforms
54
An obvious example of how new avenues of business can generate new revenue is the
ﬁeld of travel assistance where travelers would be willing to pay for location-dependent
assistance services which are constantly available to them during their voyage.
Mobile applications support traditional e-business services and solutions and enable
participants to do business on the move.
Mobile business therefore means: 
– anywhere: in the ofﬁce, at home, on the road, at transit points
– via any network: GSM/GPRS, UMTS, WLAN, ﬁxed-line
– with any device: mobile phone, PDA, PC
– in any situation: business, leisure, education.
Valuable features
Mobile business solutions will provide valuable features: 
Universality
Universality is the most obvious advantage. It fulﬁls the need for both real-time infor-
mation and communication that is independent of the user’s (device) location. 
Reachability
Reachability is important for enterprises who want to be in touch with their employees
and customers. Equipped with a mobile device, these can be contacted anywhere, any-
time. They can be notiﬁed of contacts via push services which simultaneously enable
spontaneous business opportunities.
Accessibility 
Personal and business resources can be accessed anywhere using any device via any
network, whether ﬁxed-line or wireless.
Convenience
Convenience is a characteristic of mobile devices because they not only store personal
data but also connect to the services the user needs, are always at hand and are becom-
ing increasingly simple to use. 
Localization
The localization of services and applications represents a very signiﬁcant enterprise
value-added. Knowing the physical location of a customer, employee or other traveling
individual at any given time will be crucial for the provision of the individually targeted
services, can help make business processes more efﬁcient and/or open up new business
opportunities. 

4.2 Value of mobile applications
55
Always-on 
Instant connectivity to the Internet and Intranet from a mobile device is becoming a
reality. GPRS and UMTS services will greatly accelerate the development of this capa-
bility, thus making new wireless devices the preferred mode of accessing information. 
Personalization
Personalization is one of the key features provided by mobile enterprise portals.
Thanks to personalization, the mobile device will become an everyday business tool
and will permit easy access to selected information on the basis of the user’s location
and the relevant business scenario. 
Value scenarios
Before implementing mobile applications, enterprises are recommended to look care-
fully at the value scenario. Figure 4.2 illustrates how this scenario can be approached in
a systematic way. 
An in-depth analysis involving a number of different steps must ensure that the invest-
ment in implementing mobile applications will ultimately create real value for the com-
pany.
First of all, enterprises must fully understand the mobile features and the generic value
of mobile applications as described above and consider how these might be transposed
to business processes which could be improved by increased mobility. They need to
evaluate the attractiveness of mobility as it relates to their organization. At the very
highest level, this not only includes the mobile implementation of existing packaged
applications such as web applications, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer
Relationship Management (CRM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Sales
Force Automation (SFA). It also means considering new applications capable of
improving communications and the ﬂow of information, and facilitating enterprise
interaction with employees, suppliers/business partners, and customers. 
Unlike the traditional environment in which Internet-based applications are built and
developed, the technical issues that are unique to the mobile environment must also be
considered in such cases. These considerably complicate the goal of going mobile.
The enterprise must fully understand how mobility differs from the traditional Internet
in terms of application development, support, security and evolution. After gaining an
understanding of this emerging mobile environment, the enterprise must assess each of
the major areas of complexity involved in the development of mobile applications. This
assessment will enable businesses to determine how their current infrastructure might
support mobility and identify which platform would be most suitable for their speciﬁc
requirements and overall objectives.
Only after these analyses and investigations have been conducted, the beneﬁts, such as
customer retention, increased productivity, new revenue streams, enhanced efﬁciency,
etc., can be precisely identiﬁed and the true value of mobility become apparent. 

4 Mobile applications and platforms
56
As depicted in ﬁgure 4.2, there are many technical and non-technical factors which
may inﬂuence the successful implementation of a mobile business project. The techni-
cal aspects include end-to-end security, web services (reusability of services) and the
extent to which mobility ﬁts in the existing infrastructure. The latter consideration is
important because signiﬁcant additional costs may arise if the e-business platform is
unsuitable for the adoption of mobile applications. The non-technical success factors
include ROI, the degree of user acceptance and, last but not least, the achievability of
the project targets. This latter factor is frequently the reason for the failure of a mobile
project, often due to a lack of thought during the design stage coupled with excessive
expectations.
The following checklist may help enterprises to assess mobile business opportunities:
– Identify current mobility-related market developments
– Establish commitment of top management to mobile business
– Assess the company’s current e-business activities
– Assess the current technological infrastructure and the changes required
– Identify existing and required mobile business expertise within the company
– Assess the basic business opportunities and the possible mobile business scenarios
with regard to cost savings, revenue growth, quality improvements and expanding
the existing market
– Identify new and existing corporate processes and the need to adapt these
Figure 4.2 The value scenarios of mobile business

4.3 Mobile application platforms
57
– Carry out a cost/beneﬁt analysis listing the potential of quantitative and qualitative
evaluations
– Identify the main success factors for mobile business within the enterprise
– Identify quick wins
– Draw up a mobile business roadmap as the basis for future activities and the migra-
tion plan.
4.3 Mobile application platforms
Modern e-business architectures will migrate toward integrated e-business and mobile
business architectures by supporting devices via traditional wired as well as via wire-
less networks. The core components of the application platforms – as explained in
chapter 3 – are the portal server, application server and integration server. As illus-
trated in ﬁgure 4.3, the portal server represents the single point of access and provides
integrated or separate access components for web devices and wireless IP devices, as
well as for wireless WAP devices or even voice devices. 
Irrespectively of the type of device involved, portal servers enable users to access the
enterprise’s services and resources. Nowadays, enterprise portals (including the access
components) increasingly tend to support a range of mobile devices and are conse-
quently becoming signiﬁcantly more complex. The portal must be able to identify dif-
ferent types of devices, process information in a manner speciﬁc to each device’s
Figure 4.3 Mobile enterprise portal

58
markup language, handle network and security protocols and communicate over differ-
ent kinds of gateways or proxy servers. 
An enterprise portal provides a single, consistent user interface and point of access to
any application, information or network service which a customer, employee or busi-
ness partner might need in order to fulﬁll his or her function or task. Enterprises, like
the portal users themselves, beneﬁt from portal platforms which are well-designed and,
in more general terms, optimized for either the enterprise or the consumer category.
The generic mobile portal platform may be considered as part of an advanced and
extended e-business platform. 
Some of the main beneﬁts are:
– A new, uniform front-end navigation system which enables the integration of new
mobile business processes ﬂexibly and quickly
– Role-based, personalized user experience that provides access to everything needed
to get a job done easily, anywhere, anytime 
– Single sign-on to all the different applications and services
– Pushed, personalized, relevant, up-to-date information
– Improved collaboration opportunities
– Tracking of behaviors and preferences leading to support optimization
– Centralized access control for decentralized resources
– Centralized administration of systems, devices and applications 
– Option of centralized logging that may be utilized by business intelligence applica-
tions.
4.3.1 Generic WAP architecture
Though the market introduction of WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) in 1999
proved to be anything but a success, most mobile phones that are available today sup-
port this protocol and WAP has become a de facto standard. WAP has been designed to
operate independently at the lowest level of bearer technology and will be used with
GSM, GPRS and UMTS as well as with other similar technologies such as TDMA and
CDMA.
Both the latest version, WAP 2.0 [4.3.1], and the WAP stack introduced in WAP 1 pro-
vide stack-based support and services in line with the common Internet protocols
including TCP/IP, TLS/SSL and HTTP. Although WAP is an interim technology, it
must be considered as the standard protocol for the majority of mobile phones sold
worldwide, enabling them to access Internet/Intranet resources and services. PDAs, in
contrast, usually run only the Internet protocols unless they are equipped with a WAP
browser that allows them to access original WAP content.
The WAP architecture model as illustrated in ﬁgure 4.4 was deﬁned by the WAP Forum
and derives from the WWW model. It takes account of current constraints on wireless
networks and wireless handsets. For example, the former demand data compression,

4.3 Mobile application platforms
59
long latencies and a limited bandwidth, whereas the latter have to do with low CPU and
memory capacity, small displays, restricted input capabilities, limited power, etc.
As in the WWW (World Wide Web) model, communication is initiated by means of a cli-
ent request to which the server responds. The WAP model has a WAP server instead of
web server. The WAP gateway is intermediately positioned for translation purposes.
The client’s request is binary-encoded and compressed to ﬁt in the limited bandwidth
of second generation wireless networks and contains the WWW standard URL in order
to identify the WAP content. 
The WAP gateway decodes the request and sends the URL to the WAP server. In this
process, the gateway’s main task is to translate the WAP wireless protocol stack to the
WWW protocol stack. In this way, WDP (Wireless Datagram Protocol) is equivalent to
TCP/IP, WTLS (Wireless Transport Layer Security) is equivalent to TLS/SSL and WSP
(Wireless Session Protocol) is equivalent to HTTP.
The WAP server may host the requested URL or transmit it to an application or another
website from which the content is then retrieved and returned to the WAP server which
handles the session management and end-to-end interaction between the client and the
content server. In addition, the WAP server may also transcode the content into WML
(Wireless Markup Language) if the addressed content is not present in WML.
On the return path, the WAP gateway encodes the WML content into compressed
binary form, translates the transmission protocols back from Internet to wireless, and
sends the content to the client.
The client software – i.e. the user agent – may be any piece of software, such as a
microbrowser, that interprets WML and WMLScript. The microbrowser coordinates the
Figure 4.4 WAP architecture

4 Mobile applications and platforms
60
user interface and is analogous to a standard web browser. WMLScript is an extended
subset of the JavaScript language.
The user agent software may also implement Wireless Telephony Applications (WTA)
and a WTA interface for voice applications which resides on a WTA server in the wire-
less network. The WTA server is used to provide WAP access to features of the wireless
network operator’s telecommunication infrastructure.
Push mode is the key feature differentiating the WWW and WAP models. Because the
client in a wireless network has a unique identiﬁer – the MSISDN (Mobile Station
ISDN number) – it can be directly addressed by the server. The result is that informa-
tion, alerts for example, can be pushed in real time if the client is switched on. 
The above explanation of a generic architecture does not necessarily correspond
exactly to implementations in real products. As described in the next section, the major
software vendors have integrated the WAP gateway into the portal server and WAP
server functions are provided by the application server. This type of platform is pre-
ferred for e-business and integrated mobile business solutions.
4.3.2 Integration in existing application platforms
For the foreseeable future, mainstream mobile business solutions will be created by
integrating mobile business into existing e-business architectures.
As shown in ﬁgure 4.5, a forward-looking mobile application platform supports both
wireline and wireless access to applications, services and resources. 
Figure 4.5 Integration in existing e-business solutions

4.3 Mobile application platforms
61
The transition from e-business to mobile business comprises four integration tasks, i.e.
mobile extensions to existing application platforms:
– Support for wireless access (arrow 1 in the diagram)
– Mobile device and mobile user portal integration (2)
– Implementation of new mobile applications (3)
– Application and service integration (4)
Support for wireless access
This dual mode platform can be described as a uniﬁed web/WAP platform because it
hosts business applications which are common to both wired (web) and wireless (WAP
and web) channels of communication. The platform also provides interfaces to enter-
prise services and resources, to external services, content, and web services regardless
of the device the interacting user is employing. For example, the web/WAP platform
might connect a user to a banking payment system regardless of whether he or she is
sitting at the computer or using a smartphone to shop on the go.
At a more detailed level, four different wireless channels are present. The mobile appli-
cation platform should support these channels:
– GSM/GPRS/UMTS via WAP gateway located at the mobile network operator’s site
– GSM/GPRS/UMTS directly, i.e. WAP gateway integrated in enterprise’s platform
– GSM/GPRS/UMTS with Internet protocol stack (laptop, PDA)
– WLAN
These channels use different communication protocols and, it is important to note, pos-
sess different QoS (Quality of Services) and security properties. The security issues are
particularly crucial for the proper implementation of mobile business solutions. 
One question relates to the way the WAP security issue is handled. The incompatibility
of WTLS and TSL/SSL means that, during conversion of the WTLS protocol into
TLS/SSL and vice versa in the WAP gateway, the data is brieﬂy unguarded, thus open-
ing up the possibility of a security breach, especially on the part of the staff who are
physically operating the WAP gateway system. Even if both the wireless network and
the Internet each possess high-performance security mechanisms, additional measures
are required to ensure end-to-end security. This is the reason why many enterprises
have decided to operate their WAP gateways themselves. This and other security details
are discussed in chapter 6.
Portal integration
Integration of the portal is frequently the most challenging integration task. Generic
front-end features such as scalability, presentation services, content transcoding, user
management, personalization, authentication, and other portal services are required for
both web and WAP users. There is a high level of overlapping functionality that
requires integration. 

4 Mobile applications and platforms
62
An XML/XSLT engine performs the content code transcoding from any content source
into XML code. Once transcoded into XML, the content can easily be transformed into
other languages using the XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translation) style-
sheets/processor (as described in chapter 3, ﬁgure 3.3). Such languages can be inter-
preted at the different types of mobile devices in the same way as HTML on a web cli-
ent, WML on a WAP client, tiny HTML on a PDA client, cHTML on an i-mode client,
VoiceXML (Voice eXtensible Markup Language) on a voice client, and others that
remain to be standardized in the future. 
The personalization services make a considerable contribution to the usefulness of
mobile devices and simple menu guidance is of particular importance since the
restricted possibilities of these devices mean that users must be guided directly to the
information that is relevant to them. 
From the user’s point of view, portal content and device-speciﬁc settings play an
important role, as do the various conﬁgurable preferences such as the selection of infor-
mation channels, the enabling and disabling of notiﬁcation services etc. 
As far as the enterprise is concerned, user proﬁles and authorizations are of great
importance in a variety of situations since they help regulate access to the applications
and services that are required for different business processes. As user groups may
include customers, partners and employees, user management and administration rep-
resent another difﬁcult aspect of the portal integration task in view of the use of multi-
ple devices via different communication channels.
Since the portal represents the central entry point for users, security services form an
essential component of enterprise portals. Authentication and single sign-on, role-
based authorizations and encrypted and/or authenticated data transmissions must be
available for both wireline and wireless clients. 
Some horizontal portal services could prove to be useful within mobile applications.
Real-life implementation, however, often depends on the business processes in ques-
tion. An enterprise might expand its search engines or use workﬂow and collaboration
services – such as collaborative forecasting, vendor-managed inventories or distribu-
tor/reseller management – that extend business processes beyond traditional organiza-
tional boundaries. 
New mobile applications 
Mobile enterprise applications include application classes as described in section 4.1.
Some of these, which are not industry-speciﬁc and/or are incorporated as basic fea-
tures by other applications, may be referred to as horizontal applications. Examples
are: mobile ofﬁce including PIM (Personal Information Management), location-based
services, push/notiﬁcation services, mobile travel services. Others, including security
features and downloaded content and applications, are required for the management of
mobile devices. Last but not least, there are industry-speciﬁc B2C (e.g. location-depen-
dent shopping services, banking services), B2B (e.g. ﬂeet management, tracking ser-
vices) and B2E applications (e.g. mobile workplace, mobile workforce, sales force
automation).

4.3 Mobile application platforms
63
At the technical level, it is advisable to implement such applications on the basis of an
existing application server, i.e. the core component of an enterprise application plat-
form. This is not only in order to avoid the need to set up an additional platform but
also, and more importantly, to make it possible to integrate and use portal services and
optimize business processes.
Application and service integration 
The integration with existing business applications and back-end integration are not
less important. Enterprises have made huge investments in building applications and
transforming their businesses into real e-business solutions.
Enterprises can achieve signiﬁcant cost reductions, optimize business processes, and
attract new customers by adapting mobile devices to existing processes. The integra-
tion of existing applications is the prerequisite for mobile interaction, whether – to
name but a few examples – this takes the form of a sales person accessing a customer’s
contract or certain product information while on the road, a ﬁeld engineer obtaining
spare part data while repairing a machine at a customer’s site, or a customer consulting
necessary information via a particular communication channel. Such integration might
comprise the adaptation of ERP, CRM, e-commerce, SCM, Business Information Man-
agement (BIM), legacy or other speciﬁc Intranet applications as well as access to cor-
porate directories and other data and content.
The integration of external services expands the potential for mobile device use to new
areas of application. For example, a traveler might want to obtain trafﬁc or ﬂight delay
information at a speciﬁed time on his or her way to the airport and would be willing to
pay for this valuable information. This new business scenario is growing in importance.
Two new, evolving services, i.e. pre-payment or micropayment services and location-
based services – which could, for example, be provided by a network operator – will
make such highly desirable, innovative solutions possible.
Another example of the valuable adaptation of external services might be a traveler
who needs to rebook a ﬂight during a business trip. The rebooking application could
run on the application platform and communicate with the Global Distribution Ser-
vices (GDS, Amadeus, Sabre, etc.) in order to select, conﬁrm and ﬁnally book the
appropriate ﬂight.
In the future, the integration of web services based on the Universal Description, Dis-
covery and Integration (UDDI) standard will make it signiﬁcantly easier to extend
mobile applications. It will be possible to design business logic components that can be
packed into ready-to-use web services which will be able to exchange control informa-
tion and application data with other applications using automatic, standardized opera-
tions.
4.3.3 Mobile device platforms 
Stationary desktops and laptops running the Windows operating system and browser
technology which enable simple and standardized access to the business logic tier still
dominate in today’s e-business solutions. In the future, the client environment will

4 Mobile applications and platforms
64
change signiﬁcantly and the use of a variety of mobile devices will increase sharply.
This means that enterprises and solution providers alike need to familiarize themselves
with a highly heterogeneous client system world as shown in ﬁgure 4.6.
It can be assumed that this multifaceted system environment will not get any simpler in
the next few years. Innovations and standardizations currently follow one another hap-
hazardly. Product cycles for mobile devices are frequently less than one year. 
Today’s habitual device classiﬁcations in terms of mobile phones (WAP), smartphones,
PDAs, webpads, laptops, tablet PCs etc. will probably not change greatly. However,
functional overlaps and the range of variants will increase and other classes of device
will probably become of interest, even in the business world (e.g. in-car navigation sys-
tems). The range of variants will result from differing display characteristics (size,
color), input/output facilities (with/without keyboard, stylus, touch screen), wireless
modules (GPRS, UMTS, WLAN, Bluetooth), combinable add-ons (MP3 player, cam-
era, video, GPS, etc.) and, not least, the choice of operating systems (Symbian, Win-
dows Mobile, Palm OS, Blackberry, Linux). 
Moreover, the trend towards intelligent mobile clients (also called smart clients) is
unmistakable. Intelligent mobile devices usually require a kind of additional software
(middleware) which may consist of browser plug-ins or device proﬁles and application
services. 
Intelligent clients offer a series of clear advantages:
– ofﬂine applications, databases, 
– the ability to load programs over the network, 
Figure 4.6 Increasing mobile device diversity

4.3 Mobile application platforms
65
– support for peer-to-peer protocols, 
– asynchronous messaging and electronic wallets,
to name but a few.
However, it should not be forgotten that the task of device administration, which
includes the distribution of the software and content, can become exceedingly complex
when multiple devices are involved. Browser solutions should therefore always be pre-
ferred if the above-mentioned properties or functions are not explicitly required. 
In the following, some comments and explanations regarding this increasingly complex
software environment are provided.
Operating systems
While Windows will remain the dominant OS for laptops, tablet PCs and webpads,
with a market share above 90%, Palm OS, Windows Mobile (Pocket PC and Smart-
phone), Symbian OS, Blackberry and Linux will continue to ﬁght to establish them-
selves successfully in the PDA and smartphone market.
Palm OS
is still the OS market leader for PDAs, but is losing market share to Pocket PC in the
online enterprise applications sector. Palm OS [4.3.2] can claim to provide the widest
ranging 3rd party software support and might be able to continue to occupy a leading
position in the ﬁeld of enterprise applications. It also plays a role in online applications
where it can provide access to enterprise resources provided that it is equipped with
additional security features. With the introduction of Palm OS Cobalt in 2004, Palm-
Source, Inc. extends its platform in areas such as multimedia and communications and
with its Security Framework it tries to expand growth opportunities in the business
markets. 
Windows Mobile/Pocket PC/Smartphone
are derivates of Windows CE.NET. Windows Mobile [4.3.3] is the collective term for the
Pocket PC and Smartphone operating systems comprising Pocket PC/Pocket PC Phone
Edition and Smartphone. Pocket PC currently has the highest growth rates in the PDA
class and will probably be the preferred choice for online enterprise applications in the
long term. In contrast, Windows Mobile Smartphone currently claims only a small
market share and the long-term outlook is difﬁcult to forecast. 
Symbian OS/Series 60 platform
Symbian is a software licensing company owned by Ericsson, Nokia, Panasonic, Psion,
Samsung Electronics, Siemens and Sony Ericsson. Symbian OS [4.3.4] can be licensed
and is an open OS for smartphones that includes wireless computing and telephony.
Based on Symbian OS, Nokia has developed the Series 60 platform [4.3.5], which is
also licensable, runs on Symbian OS and is currently the market leader worldwide in
the smartphone device class.

4 Mobile applications and platforms
66
BlackBerry
is a proprietary OS for the BlackBerry PDA developed by the Canadian company RIM
(Research in Motion), [4.3.6]. The product, which incorporates end-to-end wireless
mail and Intranet services, is mainly used in North America, but has now been
launched successfully in Europe by a number of network operators.
Linux
is the open source operating system offered by some PDA and smartphone manufactur-
ers since 2003. As open source market penetration will continue to grow, Linux can be
expected to play an increasingly important role in the mobile device market.
BREW
is a proprietary application platform which is marketed by the US company Qual-
comm. Devices running BREW are speciﬁcally designed for CDMA networks. Such
networks are primarily operated in the USA although some are also found in Asia.
BREW is therefore of no relevance for the European market.
Proprietary OS
currently mainly provided with WAP phones, these will probably disappear and only
survive in the low-cost category.
Browsers
Browsers are frequently provided as a component of the operating system or mobile
device. Depending on the device type, a number of different presentation languages are
supported:
– WAP phones: WML 
– i-mode phones: cHTML (language deﬁned by NTT DoCoMo, Japan, now also avail-
able in Europe) 
– PDAs, smartphones: HTML, web clipping (for restricted presentation possibilities).
In more recent devices, XHTML is also frequently supported. XHTML can be con-
sidered as a further development of WML and HTML and will replace the other pre-
sentation languages in the long term.
Device proﬁles
Device proﬁles constitute a uniform application architecture and platform for intelli-
gent mobile clients running applications locally. These proﬁles provide application
developers with speciﬁc deﬁnitions of the different devices. Conﬁgurations and proﬁles
are deﬁned for different applications. This platform allows applications to be trans-
ferred to a range of devices such as mobile telephones, smartphones, TV set-top boxes,
embedded devices, and PDAs. 
As in the server world, two different platform technologies are also emerging as the
leaders here. These can be expected to coexist for the time being. They are the Java 2

4.3 Mobile application platforms
67
Micro Edition (J2ME), speciﬁed by SUN and the Java community, and Microsoft’s
.NET Compact Framework, as depicted in ﬁgure 4.7.
Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME)
Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) [4.3.7], like Java J2SE (Standard Edition) and J2EE
(Enterprise Edition), is part of the Java family of platforms and is tailored to the
restricted scope of functions offered by simple devices. It comprises a series of pro-
gramming interfaces (APIs) and libraries which are familiar to Java developers from
the platform family. The Java community is hoping that Java client applications will
quickly become widespread as a result. The basic idea behind J2ME is application
portability, i.e. applications are executable on all J2ME devices. J2ME implementa-
tions are available for the different operating systems, including Microsoft’s OS, or
may even be provided as part of the OS, as is the case with Symbian OS.
J2ME comes in two different versions. The Connected Device Conﬁguration (CDC)
technology is based on the classic Java Virtual Machine with full functional scope,
whereas the Connected Limited Device Conﬁguration (CLDC) technology uses a sim-
pliﬁed Virtual Machine that is geared towards the limitations of simple devices (CPU
power, memory, display, etc.). 
The Mobile Information Device Proﬁle (MIDP) is a speciﬁc J2ME proﬁle which was
deﬁned for smartphone applications. It was the ﬁrst proﬁle to be developed in the Java
Community Process program. Several MIDP versions have since been released. These
provide functions and programming interfaces (APIs) for user interfaces, data storage,
Internet connections, security functions and application lifecycles. 
The MIDP applications based on these programming interfaces are known as MIDlets.
As long as low-level APIs are not used, MIDlets are portable applications. Another pro-
Figure 4.7 Mobile client architecture

ﬁle, the Personal Proﬁle, the successor to Personal Java, is suitable for a wide range of
more intelligent devices, including, for example, Linux-based devices and TV set-top
boxes. 
The standardization process for PDA proﬁles was halted in 2003 and attention has now
turned to the development of PDA proﬁle options. The J2ME platform will also permit
direct access to web services in the network. The new standard, JSR 172 (J2ME Web
Services Speciﬁcation), deﬁnes XML processing APIs and RPC-based access to web
services. 
J2ME is a proven Java-based software framework, provides portability over a wide
range of mobile devices with different operating systems, including Microsoft’s, and
allows the deployment of ofﬂine applications as well as a mix of client and server-side
programming. As J2ME has been in use for several years, a wide range of applications
exists today, mainly in the smartphone sector, thus giving J2ME a lead of about two
years over the .NET Compact Framework. 
Microsoft .NET Compact Framework
The Microsoft .NET Compact Framework [4.3.8] is part of the Microsoft .NET archi-
tecture and constitutes a restricted version of the .NET Framework that takes into
account the special characteristics of mobile devices. The .NET Compact Framework
enables the execution of secure downloadable applications and brings the world of
XML web services to mobile devices. With the extensions of the Visual Studio .NET
development environment, developers can reuse existing programming skills and exist-
ing code throughout the desktop, mobile device and server environments. By using
familiar programming interfaces (APIs) and libraries from the .NET Framework,
Microsoft is attempting to use the considerable potential possessed by Visual Basic
programmers for the implementation of new client applications.
The .NET Compact Framework delivers the same programming model across a range
of devices, thus simplifying the process of developing an application that can run on
multiple (.NET) devices. It is based on a virtual machine represented by the Common
Language Runtime. It is also designed to be extended with class libraries detailing fea-
tures that are unique to a family of devices, or even unique to a particular device model.
As well as supporting the common base classes, the .NET Compact Framework also
supports connectivity functions for the different wireless networks, XML, functions for
data access (ADO.NET, SQL Server CE), and security functions. The built-in security
model ensures that malicious code cannot gain access to secure system resources and
allows software updates to be delivered over the wireless network.
Through the use of client-side code, the .NET Compact Framework permits the deploy-
ment of ofﬂine applications and a mix of client-side and server-side programming. The
.NET Compact Framework also makes it possible to build and consume web services.
XML web services are a useful application model for mobile devices since these need
to communicate with a variety of other systems and applications regardless of operat-
ing system or programming language.

4.3 Mobile application platforms
69
Microsoft is known for providing excellent development tools (see next section) and
these also include tools supporting the .NET Compact Framework.
In contrast to J2ME, the .NET Compact Framework only runs on Microsoft operating
systems.
4.3.4 Examples of forward-looking mobile application platforms
In the early days of the mobile application era, a number of start-up companies offered
mobile application platforms and development tools that contained a limited range of
valuable features. However, this middleware was often based on non-standard, propri-
etary software that was not integrated in existing portal server and application server
landscapes. The result was that most of these companies were unable to survive.
Since then, all the major platform vendors have adopted tools and features for integrat-
ing mobile applications. Microsoft, IBM and SAP now enjoy a secure position in this
sector. This is due, on the one hand, to the market penetration of their middleware plat-
forms and applications, and, on the other, to the partially integrated tools and functions
that are now provided for the building of mobile applications. Nonetheless, today’s
implementations are not mature and software versions have short lifecycles. Given that
web services will become an important consideration for mobile applications, the three
platforms mentioned above are probably the ones that are best placed for the future
(For more details, see chapter 5). 
Alongside the platforms offered by the major vendors, three examples of specialized
mobile business solutions or services are also worthy of mention: Extended Systems’
Mobile Solutions Platform, the Managed Mobile Device service offered by Siemens
Business Services and Mobility Solutions from Fujitsu Siemens Computers. 
Some of the main features of these platforms are brieﬂy described below.
Microsoft Mobile .NET 
Microsoft’s vision of doing business in any place, with any device, at any time ﬁrst
emerged in 2000 and initial support for mobile devices has been provided in the form
of the Mobile Information Server and the Mobile Outlook Manager, a component of
Outlook which runs on the user’s PC. Starting from these beginnings, Microsoft’s com-
mitment to supporting mobile devices and applications has been impressively demon-
strated by the development of Windows Mobile (Pocket PC and Smartphone), the
.NET Compact Framework, Outlook Mobile Access and the integration of mobility in
.NET servers. Microsoft’s Mobile .NET architecture is presented in ﬁgure 4.8. It com-
prises mobile clients, support for wireless networks, enterprise servers and services,
web services, user experiences, solutions and tools. 
The aspects most deserving of mention are the development tools for mobile applica-
tions provided with the Visual Studio .NET Development Environment [4.3.9] and its
extension, known as Smart Device Programmability for Visual Studio.NET, that is used
in conjunction with the .Net Compact Framework. 

4 Mobile applications and platforms
70
When designing ASP.NET mobile web applications, it is beneﬁcial to separate the deﬁ-
nition of the user interface from the business logic and data storage aspects. The key
advantage of separating rendering from logic is that code written for a desktop or
mobile device application can be reused. Although it is necessary to write one set of
Web Form pages for the desktop and one set of Mobile Web Form pages for mobile
devices, they can nevertheless share the same business logic code. 
Both the .Net Framework and .NET Compact Framework comprise the concept of
Mobile Controls. ASP.NET automatically breaks up large web pages into smaller units
that are appropriate for mobile devices and different containers can be used to render
content for ASP.NET Mobile Controls. At runtime, various Mobile Controls for differ-
ent content types (e.g. textview, textbox, list, link, command, calendar, image, etc.)
generate the appropriate code as a function of the device class or even the device type.
This means the developer does not need to worry about the rendering speciﬁcs of dif-
ferent mobile devices.
Thanks to the concept of Mobile Controls and the reuse of business logic, it is possible
to offer users of ﬁxed and mobile devices a more integrated experience. Moreover,
development costs can be reduced by using common code while also slashing time-to-
market. In terms of usability and productivity, Microsoft’s development tools are the
best available today.
IBM WebSphere Everyplace family
The Everyplace family [4.3.10] consists of a set of components for network connec-
tion, enterprise access, transformation, management, development tools and also
includes enterprise mobile solutions. The most important are:
Figure 4.8 Microsoft’s Mobile .NET architecture

4.3 Mobile application platforms
71
Everyplace Connection Manager
provides secure connections from a mobile device to the enterprise Intranet using a
mobile Virtual Private Network via WLAN, GSM/GPRS and other networks. When
conﬁgured as a WAP proxy it can also provide connectivity for WAP clients. In addi-
tion, the Connection Manager supports multiple levels of authentication and encryption
and also incorporates WTLS and SSL connectivity. Most important is the dynamic
roaming feature that allows mobile users to maintain session persistence when the
mobile device changes network, e.g. from WLAN to GPRS.
Everyplace Access
provides the functionality to extend existing or new applications to the wireless world.
As shown in ﬁgure 4.9, it supports server synchronization of PIM, e-mail functions for
Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange as well as the synchronization services required
to extend enterprise databases and web applications to mobile users. 
Everyplace Access additionally provides notiﬁcation (push) services that proactively
notify users of key information or events when triggered by news, e-mail or enterprise
applications. Everyplace Access is part of the WebSphere portal and application server
infrastructure that combines to constitute a reliable and scalable mobile application
platform.
Everyplace WebSphere Studio 
provides an integrated development environment for mobile devices, content adapta-
tion and portlet development tools to extend applications to both browser-based and
Java-based (J2SE and J2ME) mobile devices.
Because portlets can be used in connected or disconnected browser-based applications,
IBM’s mobile programming model promotes portals as a mechanism for aggregating
information and accessing enterprise services regardless of the device. Consequently,
Everyplace Toolkit for WebSphere Studio also includes portal/portlet tools for creating,
testing, debugging and deploying individual mobile portlets and web content and
allowing portlet rendering on mobile devices. Templates enable developers to create
their own mobile portlets and applications more quickly and easily.
Content adaptation tools, such as markup and annotation editors, allow developers to
create new and adapt existing content for multiple markup languages supported by dif-
ferent devices. The Everyplace Toolkit for WebSphere Studio also provides samples
and templates for some of the most popular mobile applications.
SAP Mobile Infrastructure
The SAP Mobile Infrastructure (SAP MI) is embedded in the mySAP technology as
well as in NetWeaver (details in chapter 5). It consists of the Mobile Engine (SAP ME)
installed on a mobile device and Mobile Engine server components running on SAP
Web Application Server. SAP MI includes synchronization and replication features that
make it possible to connect the mobile user to the back-end resources in the enterprise

4 Mobile applications and platforms
72
IT landscape. SAP MI uses authentication, role-based authorization and Secure Sock-
ets Layer (SSL) to create a secure, end-to-end connection between the mobile device
and the back-end system. It is integrated in the SAP Enterprise Portal and may use cen-
tral services such as installation, user and application management. 
Figure 4.9 WebSphere Everyplace access model (Source: IBM)
Figure 4.10 SAP Mobile Engine  (Source: SAP)

4.3 Mobile application platforms
73
SAP ME [4.3.11] provides the mobile application platform (see ﬁgure 4.10). It is based
on J2ME/J2SE as a platform-independent runtime environment for mobile applica-
tions and is suitable to run on laptops, PDAs and smartphones. SAP ME supports net-
work connections such as WLAN, GSM/GPRS and Bluetooth. 
SAP ME includes its own web server, database and business logic, i.e. it can extend
enterprise capabilities to users whether or not they are connected to the enterprise net-
work. It enables multiple users to access the same device, thus ensuring that shift work-
ers are also supported. SAP ME possesses a series of tools which facilitate the develop-
ment of mobile applications and support the administration and use of these applica-
tions. Enterprises and partners can develop their own solutions to work alongside SAP
standard mobile application implementations.
Extended Systems Mobile Solutions Platform
The intention behind Extended Systems Mobile Solutions Platform [4.3.12], which
includes business solutions for sales and ﬁeld services, is to enable enterprises to opti-
mize their technology investments by making existing applications available to sales
representatives and workers in the ﬁeld, on the road, and in remote ofﬁce locations
within the context of the enterprise network architecture. 
The Mobile Solutions Platform provides device access, wireless network support,
deployment tools, end-to-end security, synchronization, management/administration
and customization features as well as application integration. 
The device access capabilities include Palm, Pocket PC, Smartphones, Symbian,
browser-based devices (WAP phones, laptops) while network support comprises GSM,
GPRS, CDMA, Bluetooth, WLAN, Infrared, Cable/Cradle. 
As shown in ﬁgure 4.11, the Mobile Solutions Platform provides access to various
back-end systems and applications. 
Figure 4.11 Extended Systems Mobile Solution Platform (Source: Extended Systems)

4 Mobile applications and platforms
74
The platform can provide multiple front- and back-end services and resources in one
uniﬁed view and is accessible through a single login, thus facilitating workﬂow man-
agement. Pre-built connectors to Siebel CRM, SAP ERP, Microsoft Exchange and
Lotus Notes facilitate the integration to enterprises’ standard applications. Expanded
connectors may integrate custom systems. The platform supports deployment on indus-
try-leading Java application servers on both Windows and Unix operating systems.
The Mobile Solutions Platform is characterized by its system-independence and the
wealth of the available device, network and management support.
Managed Mobile Device (MMD)
MMD is a service offered by Siemens Business Services for the management of PDAs
and Smartphones with the operating system Windows Mobile. It covers initial installa-
tion, the central management of devices, applications and content as well as secure
access to enterprise resources. 
The initial installation and conﬁguration of the mobile devices is performed by means
of a personalized SD/MMC (SD Card/Multimedia Memory Card) which contains all
the conﬁguration data, personal data and any customized modules. Once the user has
been provided with this card by postal delivery and after plugging in the card and put-
ting in the personal ID, the device will be installed automatically in just a few minutes
without any confusing conﬁguration operations and without the need for a cradle. 
The main characteristic distinguishing this service from its competitors is that users are
able to employ their customized applications productively without any further conﬁgu-
rations immediately after card insertion and automatic installation. The central man-
agement of the devices together with data and software distribution ensures that appli-
Figure 4.12 Managed Mobile Device (MMD) services

75
cations and data versions are uniform and up-to-date at only low operating costs.
Updates and changes can be performed online via mobile networks (GPRS, WLAN,
UMTS) or LAN. 
Other advantages of MMD are the high level of security thanks to encryption features,
the use of VPN and optional virus protection as well as the high device availability
through backup functions and automatic recovery functions in the case of a system
fault. With this outstanding properties the MMD is particularly suitable as the basis for
mobile business applications with access to the Intranet. The optional e-mail/PIM mod-
ule makes it possible to use the mail/contact/calendar functions of Microsoft Exchange
and Lotus Domino servers.

4.4 Example applications
The ﬁrst wave of mobile enterprise applications is over. Some of the early technology
and mobile (proprietary) platform providers have disappeared, while mobile business
projects have often failed to meet expectations or have not proved to be of real value to
companies.

4 Mobile applications and platforms
76
Studies by analysts show that the level of usability and the features provided by mobile
devices are considered to be sufﬁcient (with the exception of battery power), but that
wireless support, application integration and services still need to be improved. Secu-
rity is the only truly critical issue and may prevent the deployment and broader accep-
tance of mobile applications.
It is interesting that CEOs, business unit executives and CIOs provide a quite different
assessment of the problems encumbering mobile business solutions. While CEOs
mainly point to the high costs of introduction and operation, business executives cite
only the introduction cost combined with features that are still required in order to add
value to mobile solutions. CIOs refer to inadequate security as the main reason prevent-
ing introduction.
Nevertheless, recent years have shown that enterprises can expect mobile applications
to provide real value in the following areas:
– Sales force automation
– Field service
– Supply chain optimization
– Tracking and logistics
– Process monitoring
B2E applications such as sales force automation and ﬁeld service are discussed in the
following section. A simple look at the main characteristics of the other application
ﬁelds is taken below.
Supply chain optimization
The efﬁciency of a supply chain depends on the optimal coordination of the various
stages that are involved in the creation of a product, for example on an assembly line or
in the delivery of a service. This coordination can be optimized by a control center
which knows the location of the individual objects and can actively control the move-
ment and coordination of these objects in accordance with predeﬁned process models.
Cross-enterprise solutions are the most popular ones. 
The location of these moving objects at any given time can be achieved by deploying
wireless technologies, such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation), GSM/GPRS,
and GPS, either automatically (e.g. by means of embedded RFID chips) or by individ-
uals (e.g. an assembly line manager) who transmit the location data via GPRS or
WLAN to the control center.
Some of the beneﬁts are increased speed of production, fewer bottlenecks, efﬁcient use
of stocks and ﬂexible exception handling. 
Tracking and logistics
The human errors and uncontrolled shipment activities that may occur during logistical
and shipment operations frequently create problems for providers and result in cus-
tomer dissatisfaction. Through the deployment of wireless technologies, items for ship-

4.4 Example applications
77
ment can be traced precisely irrespectively of their location, while different activities
such as the choice of transport vehicle, route coordination, partner coordination, and
cost-related measures can be efﬁciently organized. As mentioned in connection with
supply chain solutions, different wireless technologies may be combined and deployed. 
The beneﬁts are enhanced precision, reduced response times, cost savings, customer
and partner satisfaction.
Process monitoring
Many enterprise operations can be viewed as a series of connected transactions extend-
ing throughout the value chain. Enterprise applications support various processes such
as human resource processes, customer proﬁling, order processing, shipping, billing,
inspections, quality assurance, repairs, etc. The monitoring of such processes in order
to uncover bottlenecks or errors and identify performance criteria is essential if contin-
uous improvement is to be achieved. It makes sense not to limit these monitoring tasks
to wireline networks. 
The way such processes are supported by mobile technologies depends very much on
the kind of process itself. Just to give one example: It could be much more efﬁcient to
locate spare parts for IT equipment in a set of on-the-road vehicles instead of storing
them in a conventional warehouse. The vehicles’ locations and routes can be checked
in real time, and optimally modiﬁed as a function of the reported events. This could
considerably shorten downtimes and improve service levels.
4.4.1 B2E applications
Analysts predict that B2E applications will become important components of success-
ful mobile business solutions. The example in ﬁgure 4.13 provides an illustration of
such applications.
Studies suggest that, depending on the branch of industry in question, between 20%
and 80% of an enterprise’s employees can be considered to be mobile workers or trav-
eling employees and executives, using the criterion that more than 20% of their work-
ing time is spent out of their ofﬁce or they urgently need mobile support during their
trips. On average, about 40% of such personnel are employed as sales staff, while
nearly 30%, the second largest group, work in the ﬁeld service, followed by traveling
employees at 20% and executives/managers at 10%.
PIM (Personal Information Management, i.e. e-mail, calendar, contacts, and notes),
interfaced with Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Notes, is vital to all these groups and is
therefore considered to be a top-priority, horizontal mobile application. Travel assis-
tance services (ﬂight information, reservations, booking, route ﬁnding, location ﬁnd-
ing, etc.) constitute another horizontal application which could be provided alongside
PIM either by enterprises themselves or by network operators (e.g. location-based ser-
vices) or service providers (e.g. global distribution services, such as offered by Sabre or
Amadeus).

4 Mobile applications and platforms
78
The other example applications shown in the diagram either need to be integrated in
enterprises’ speciﬁc data resources or applications (e.g. directory services, databases,
data warehouses) or belong to the category of vertical applications because they are
dedicated to speciﬁc tasks and have to be connected to enterprise applications (e.g.
CRM, ERP, SCM). For the most part, such applications will be provided by enterprises
themselves or by specialized outsourcing service providers which operate applications,
services and processes on behalf of their customers (enterprises). 
The scenarios of travel assistance services, sales force automation and an example ﬁeld
service solution are illustrated below in order to increase readers’ awareness of mobile
solutions and demonstrate the viability and beneﬁts of such approaches.
Seamless mobile travel services 
Seamless mobile travel services which support travelers before, during, and after the
trip, as depicted in ﬁgure 4.14, provide an excellent example of a valuable mobile ser-
vice:
Travelers usually use their own computer to make travel arrangements, e.g. to set up
the itinerary, book ﬂights or train tickets, rent cars, or reserve hotel rooms in accordance
with the company’s travel management rules. During this process, the traveler can
check his/her mileage account or upgrade ﬂights if desired. The travel portal offers
additional services which can be booked in advance, such as evening or weekend
events at the ﬁnal destination. 
On the way to the airport, the traveler is automatically alerted about possible trafﬁc jams
and diverted to an alternative route if necessary. Even before entering the airport, the
traveler uses push technology on the phone to check into her or his ﬂight, obtain a park-
ing space, gate and seat number and ﬁnd out the scheduled departure time.
Figure 4.13 B2E applications

4.4 Example applications
79
Before meeting the customer, the traveler might check in at the hotel and access com-
pany resources in order to obtain the latest sales ﬁgures or update a presentation. The
portal authenticates the user, who will be logging in from either a laptop or PDA, and
routes him/her through to the appropriate applications.
There is no need for a secretary to make the travel arrangements, especially when it is
necessary to change ﬂights or hotel reservations or cope with any other unforeseen
events that occur during a trip.
The personal travel assistant, implemented as a portal software component, helps the
traveler, who may be in New York, to rearrange and rebook the trip immediately while
his or her secretary is still asleep in Munich. The travel portal also knows the traveler’s
location and is informed of his or her booking preferences as well as the company’s
travel rules and regulations. Moreover, the personal assistant provides weather infor-
mation, trafﬁc information, airport and check-in data, and schedule changes. Optional
local guides, maps, and transportation support, coupled with entertainment and shop-
ping services, will help travelers make the most of their leisure time.
As the travel portal is even able to trace rebooking activities, it can generate a travel
expense report by the end of the trip. Business intelligence software integrated in the
portal can analyze the traveler’s trips and help the company obtain better booking con-
ditions and cut costs by optimizing travel expense processes and improving the produc-
tivity of traveling employees.
Mobile sales force automation
Sales professionals are by nature highly mobile individuals and can achieve signiﬁcant
improvements in productivity by using wireless technologies to communicate more
effectively. Mobile sales force automation can eliminate the information gaps that most
sales people are familiar with, such as those relating to customer purchasing behavior,
Figure 4.14 Seamless travel management 

4 Mobile applications and platforms
80
new product conﬁgurations, and order status. Moreover, mobile solutions can enable
the seamless exchange of customer data between sales and service employees who may
often be working simultaneously at different locations at a customer’s site. This kind of
coordination improves responsiveness and customer satisfaction. 
The following scenario, which is typical of a sales professional’s working day, shows
how wireless technologies can increase productivity:
Robert, a sales professional working for a company which offers IT services and prod-
ucts, starts his working day by connecting his laptop from his home via DSL and VPN to
the corporate employees’ portal, answering any mails he has received, looking up his
scheduled appointments (Outlook/Exchange), and reviewing the status of customer’s
orders (CRM) and shipment dates (ERP). Robert is identiﬁed and authenticated easily
and automatically by means of a smartcard which is inserted in his laptop slot and con-
tains his digital certiﬁcates and passwords.
To visit the ﬁrst customer of the day, Robert uses his Pocket PC with GPRS and GPS
capability and the Tom Tom Navigator application to ﬁnd the best route to the customer’s
location. On his way there, he remembers that a technical question asked by the cus-
tomer has not yet been answered. Using his GPRS mobile phone, he accesses a WAP
application to obtain the telephone number of a technical expert from the corporate
directory. He calls the expert and clariﬁes the question.
At the car park at the customer’s site, Robert connects his Pocket PC via GPRS and
VPN to the corporate network to access the CRM application that allows him to check
the latest ﬁeld service reports concerning his customer. He notices that a serious prob-
lem has occurred with an update installation of a mySAP application earlier in the morn-
ing. With a few stylus taps on his Pocket PC, he asks to be notiﬁed automatically by the
CRM application when this failure has been eliminated.
Robert then presents a new service level concept at the customer’s ofﬁce using an
ofﬂine application running on his laptop and explains the technical details of the open
question. The customer asks to be informed of some critical shipment dates for ordered
products. Robert again uses his always-on PDA and connects to the ERP application to
get the required information. He is relieved to learn that the products have already been
shipped the day before and will easily arrive before the deadline. During his ﬁnal discus-
sion with the customer, his PDA beeps and Robert is notiﬁed that the service team has
solved the update problem and normal operation has resumed. The customer
expresses his satisfaction and signs a new service level agreement.
Robert’s next visit is to a coffee shop. After presenting a voucher and obtaining a new
PIN, Robert is able to use the shop’s WLAN hotspot to connect his laptop via the VPN
to the corporate network. He transmits the data of the new service level agreement to
the CRM system in order to provide the latest information for the monthly report which
has to be ﬁnished the same evening. At the same time, following the success of the
recent customer meeting, Robert requests the CRM system to send out offers and pro-
posals to present the new service level concept to ﬁve more customers. The CRM sys-
tem provides multichannel services and, because it is informed of the customers’ com-
munication capabilities and preferences, it knows whether it is best to send them faxes
or mails or to contact them by phone. In real time, Robert is informed by the CRM sys-
tem that one of the selected customers should be contacted by phone. Robert looks up
the customer’s activities history in the CRM system and phones immediately to set up a
meeting.

4.4 Example applications
81
Robert stays in the coffee shop while the corporate central administration system
actively updates corporate data based on Robert’s working proﬁle and downloads it to
his always-on PDA. Robert is notiﬁed that some new product conﬁgurations have been
released and the prices are added to the downloaded Excel price tables. Because this
is relevant to his next customer visit, he downloads the new data sheets to his laptop,
connects the laptop and PDA via Bluetooth and adds the data sheets and price tables
as appendices to the draft contract which he is to discuss during his following meeting. 
At the next customer’s site, he ﬁnds a printer and prints out the updated contract and
appendices via a wireless Bluetooth connection. This means that he is able to discuss
the contract with the printed document on the table as most customers prefer.
Before Robert leaves the customer’s car park on his way to the airport in the late after-
noon, he accesses a WAP application from his mobile phone and orders a bouquet of
ﬂowers to be delivered to his wife as a birthday surprise the following day. Then he
requests a parking slot in the airport’s parking area by sending an SMS, specifying the
required time to the parking service operator. A few seconds later, he receives the
response SMS containing the slot identiﬁcation and sends another SMS to conﬁrm the
booking. Both the ﬂowers and the car park fee will be paid for via the network operator’s
phone bill. 
Once at the airport, Robert has an hour to wait and is again able to connect his laptop to
the corporate network via the airport WLAN hotspot. He goes through the list of e-mails
and downloads a PowerPoint ﬁle, updated by a colleague, which he needs for the next
day’s presentation. Next he starts the enterprise’s e-learning program in order to com-
plete his knowledge about US GAAP balance sheet methods. The central e-learning
web application has monitored the state of Robert’s knowledge and registered which
modules have been stored locally on his laptop. Robert completes the test for the last
lesson and downloads the modules that make up the next lesson in order to be able to
continue learning ofﬂine. 
In the evening, at the hotel where he will be staying, Robert uses his mobile equipment
for his leisure activities such as sending MMS, listening to MP3 music and ﬁnding a res-
taurant.
Mobile ﬁeld service 
The following example, m-butler, is a mobile application offered by Siemens Business
Services that can be customized to ﬁt in with various ﬁeld service scenarios. The over-
view in ﬁgure 4.15 shows the ﬁeld service provider, a mobile ﬁeld engineer and the
customer location.
The ﬁeld service provider offers maintenance and repair services for complex medical
systems, such as computer tomography, angiography, x-ray systems, etc. The service
provider operates a call center, with the CRM and ERP components being provided by
the SAP/R3 system, in order to provide customer care, respond to requests and support
maintenance and repair operations. Furthermore, a communication center interfaces
with the R3 system and controls the workforce operations of some one hundred ﬁeld
engineers. This also includes a dispatching service that manages communications by
sending e-mails, SMS and faxes and receiving messages. 
The mobile ﬁeld engineers are usually on the road and communicate with their control
center via PDA and GSM/GPRS networks. 

4 Mobile applications and platforms
82
A typical customer request process concerning a defective machine begins with a cus-
tomer call to the Call Center. If the Call Center agent cannot help to rectify the described
fault, the fault process is initiated in the ERP system and assigned to an appropriate
service engineer depending on availability, qualiﬁcations and distance from the cus-
tomer site. These ﬁeld engineer parameters are constantly monitored and the repair
order is automatically assigned to the selected ﬁeld engineer. 
The CRM system knows the customer’s history and machine conﬁgurations and the
Call Center agent can type in some characteristic fault symptoms in an appropriate fault
category mask. By comparing these against a fault history database, the ERP system
can retrieve repair instructions and, if necessary, can check the spare parts inventory
and order the delivery of spare parts in advance to the customer’s or ﬁeld engineer’s
location.
The service engineer communicates online with the Communication Center and the R3
system using his PDA to exchange the relevant information, such as the customer’s
location and history, machine conﬁguration, fault speciﬁcs, repair instructions, spare
parts delivery, etc. He conﬁrms the order and speciﬁes the expected time of arrival. The
service engineer is then guided to the customer’s location by his PDA navigation sys-
tem.
The service engineer collects the material delivered in advance from a drop-off point
and scans in the part IDs using his PDA’s scanning application.
When the service engineer arrives at the customer’s premises, he sends an on-site
repair message. Once the work has been successfully completed, the service report is
prepared in an R3 mask, presented on the PDA and submitted to the R3 system. The
report consists of information about working hours, customer data, material consump-
tion, expense data, fault-related and quality assurance statements, as well as spare part
returns in cases where expensive parts need to be returned to a repair center. The cen-
Figure 4.15 Mobile ﬁeld service: m-butler

4.4 Example applications
83
tral R3 system processes the report data automatically and carries out the appropriate
follow-up processes such as billing, updating the customer history and the fault data-
bases, and spare parts tracking. 
This example application again shows how enterprises that offer this kind of ﬁeld ser-
vice can optimize processes in a way that brings beneﬁts to both their customers and
themselves. The beneﬁts to the customer – fast, competent, convenient repair pro-
cesses, reduced machine downtimes and loss of revenue – result in customer satisfac-
tion and retention. The beneﬁts to the enterprise help improve its competitiveness.
These result in signiﬁcant cost savings and enhance many areas of enterprise operation
such as the deployment and motivation of ﬁeld engineers, cost transparency, simpliﬁed
administration of customer service calls and control of ﬁeld engineers, improved mate-
rial and quality assurance processes, etc.
4.4.2 Other mobile applications
Mobile applications will inﬂuence virtually every human activity. Therefore not only
network operators, but many other service providers such as ﬁnancial institutions,
insurance companies, the trading, retail and wholesale sectors, agencies, content pro-
viders, governments and others will participate in the mobile business world. 
Mobile payment and mobile ticketing are interesting, lucrative areas of development
and dozens of different mobile solutions are already available today. The next step that
needs to be taken in these areas is to consolidate and standardize the solutions in order
to generate greater momentum.
Mobile advertising, shopping, auction and trading portals and solutions also constitute
current examples illustrating the scope of mobile applications. Even government agen-
Figure 4.16 Mobile Healthcare Life Portal

84
cies now use wireless technologies, for example for monitoring crime-related events
and criminals. 
Although it is not the ambition of this book to describe all these inspiring applications,
the example of the mobile Healthcare Life Portal in ﬁgure 4.16 may help demonstrate
how most individuals’ lifestyles will be affected by new mobile solutions in the future. 
This portal provides consolidated healthcare information to its subscribers and com-
prises lifestyle services, medical services and location services that can be accessed via
a variety of mobile devices. It could be offered by a private healthcare insurance com-
pany whose core business is the insurance of special medical services. By offering
additional services, the company is able to differentiate itself from its competitors.
The range of personalized, consolidated healthcare information such as patient records,
coupled with monitoring services (e.g. diabetes) and medical consulting, not to men-
tion the coverage of health-related leisure activities (lifestyle services) such as sports,
gymnastics, wellness, healthy eating, shopping and travel information, etc. and addi-
tional location services (where is the nearest pharmacy?) could prove to be very attrac-
tive to most of the portal’s users.
For an example of a real portal of this type, see [4.4.1].
4.4.3 Prospects involving UMTS
Despite the arrival of UMTS in Europe in 2003/2004, GSM/GPRS networks and appli-
cations will remain in use at least through 2010. It is therefore important to stress that
mobile business is already offering the types of valuable applications that have been
described above. Nonetheless, the new features and services offered by UMTS will
enhance existing applications, while new business opportunities will open up new mar-
ket segments.
Quality of service (QoS) levels will be a key success factor, while the bandwidth capa-
bility of UMTS will be crucial for the provision of improved services and the creation
of new business opportunities.
Figure 4.17 UMTS – service quality

4.4 Example applications
85
As shown in ﬁgure 4.17, typical download times will be reduced signiﬁcantly in UMTS
networks. Application classes such as videophone, streaming video or multimedia mes-
saging require the greater bandwidth capability provided by UMTS networks in order
to offer improved quality. Today’s GSM networks already meet other QoS require-
ments, such as low delay time. For example, browsing the web does not make sense
with a GSM mobile device. While a GPRS device might be an acceptable way of per-
forming this task, a UMTS device offers users a completely new experience. Common
experiences of ﬁxed-line networks provide a good analogy with performance varying
from low-speed modem to ISDN and on up to DSL.
The UMTS Forum has deﬁned six basic 3G/UMTS service classes which might drive
the 3G market:
– mobile Intranet/Extranet access (business)
– location-based services (consumer and business)
– rich voice (consumer and business) 
– multimedia messaging services (consumer)
– mobile Internet access (consumer) 
– customized infotainment (consumer).
Given the focus on enterprise applications, the ﬁrst three of these service classes are the
most signiﬁcant and will be examined in more detail below.
Mobile Intranet/Extranet access is already a widespread phenomenon today. However,
UMTS will represent a new departure in terms of user experience and bandwidth which
will make new practical applications possible. Browsing with transmission rates of 144
kbit/s or more is a quite inspiring experience that makes it a simple task to download
PowerPoint ﬁles or other bulk data. The ability to transfer usable quality video clips
will clear the way for new applications, such as downloading instruction videos to
assist maintenance engineers in the repair of complex machines.
Location-based services are also offered by most network operators today. With the
exception of the improved location sensing methods, there is no essential difference
between the service quality of UMTS and GPRS-based applications. In order to ensure
that these services are available worldwide, it is important that network operators are
able to expand their roaming agreements. Furthermore, the success of location-based
services primarily depends on it being a proﬁtable proposition for a variety of different
partners to participate in the total value chain. These partners may be network operators
(owners of the location’s geo-coordinates, billing), content providers and content aggre-
gators, as well as solution providers, service providers, enterprises and consumers.
The 3G rich voice service is a real-time, two-way service for businesses and consumers
that provides advanced-voice capabilities such as concurrent voice and data services
using VoIP, voice-activated net access and web-initiated voice calls, while still offering
traditional mobile voice features. Voice is an essential component in many data-ori-
ented services and will quickly evolve into a packet-based, IP-oriented service to
enable new applications such as speech recognition and voice-activated Intranet access. 

4 Mobile applications and platforms
86
Mobile videophony is a natural evolution of today’s voice services and rich multimedia
services may very well become valuable applications for enterprises in the long term. 
4.5 Summary and recommendations 
Business outlook
The outlook for mobile business solutions seems very promising. According to a study
by the Boston Consulting Group, the expected gain in productivity to enterprises in
2006 due to mobile business solutions is expected to amount to $520 billion world-
wide. An average increase in productivity of 6% is predicted. Enterprises will spend
$340 billion on establishing and operating mobile business solutions. This means that
$180 billion of added value will be created. The main factors for successful deploy-
ment will be cost efﬁciency, improved processes and asset management, increased
employee effectiveness, customer retention and new business opportunities. 
According to Gartner, the global IT economy will have rebounded strongly by 2006.
Most enterprises will soon change their strategic focus from cutting costs and protect-
ing proﬁts to driving growth aggressively.
One of the driving factors that will be particularly inﬂuential in the ﬁeld of mobile busi-
ness will be the changing signiﬁcance of work and leisure. With the introduction of
ﬂexible working hours, traditional ﬁxed time work is evolving into anytime work. The
emergence of distributed teams means that traditional ﬁxed place work is changing into
anywhere work. Finally, in a connected society, work will ultimately be performed in
virtual collaborative environments created and mediated by IT systems. Gartner
believes the always-on or connected society will rapidly emerge during the next
decade. In Gartner’s view, by 2007, over 75% of EU and US citizens will have the
option of immediate access to e-services for over 80% of their nonworking time.
Architecture 
Mobile solutions should be based on proven, standards-oriented infrastructures and
easily integrable, modular building blocks and multitier architectures which enable
step-by-step implementations that cater for the requirements of users while also
responding to the needs and capabilities of both business units and IT organizations. 
Reusable web services integrated in enterprises’ portal architectures are recommended
as the best way to meet economic targets while also achieving the agility and ﬂexibility
which are needed to stay competitive.
While the portal architecture will dominate enterprise business architectures, direct
access from the client to web services in the network (e.g. for travel reservations)
together with the ofﬂine processing of the results (e.g. entry of relevant data in the busi-
ness traveler’s appointments diary and itinerary) will signiﬁcantly expand the spectrum
of possible applications in the medium term. However, this does not mean that intelli-

4.5 Summary and recommendations 
87
gent clients are compulsory for modern mobile business solutions. Centralized applica-
tions with browser clients are much easier to manage and often the most promising
solution.
Strategy
Enterprises need to build mobile support into their application architecture. Although
this should not prevent the necessary experimentation, these initial projects should be
seen as part of a larger strategic plan and provide short-term return on investment.
Therefore ‘low-hanging fruits’ and ‘quick wins’ should be the ﬁrst application areas.
The recommendation is to keep ﬁrst implementations simple, but to consider the long-
term infrastructural, architectural and strategic implications carefully from the very
outset. 
In particular, mobile applications and solutions must be framed within a comprehen-
sive enterprise security and web services infrastructure strategy. Moreover, service-ori-
ented architectures, business process management and cross-enterprise processes must
be taken into consideration when designing mobile solutions (For more details, see
chapter 5). Enterprises that ignore the impact of mobility on their infrastructures and
architectures are not only neglecting an increasingly important part of their business
but will inevitably see their software maintenance costs soar.
Smart enterprises should be looking critically, but also imaginatively, at the potential
offered by mobile solutions and gauging that potential against the technological, orga-
nizational and process implications of wireless implementations. In most cases, they
will discover compelling business cases for moving forward with mobile solutions
sooner rather than later.

5 Web services
As mentioned in chapter 3, the pressures on IT executives have strongly increased dur-
ing the past years. They have to cut costs while at the same time to innovate IT-infra-
structure. Moreover they need to improve customer services, to be more competitive
and to respond quickly to the business’s strategic priorities.
Two fundamental reasons are behind all of this hassle: The heterogeneous system and
application landscape and the rapidly changing market requirements.
Most enterprises cannot take a single-vendor approach to IT, because available applica-
tion suites are not sufﬁcient and ﬂexible enough, which potentially leads to higher
costs. Embracing heterogeneity therefore often is the better practice, because a best-of-
breed approach can be more affordable and efﬁcient. Interoperability obviously is the
only way to overcome these inconsistencies and may even drive new IT investment. 
Increasing market changes are the second issue. Business must adapt rapidly in today’s
dynamic competitive environment, and the IT infrastructure must follow. Change is an
ever-present issue in the IT world for several reasons:
Broad economic forces including globalization and e-business are accelerating the
pace of change. Global competition leads to shortening product cycles, as companies
try to gain advantage over their competition. Customer needs and requirements change
more quickly in response to this cycle of competitive improvements in products and
services. Finally improvements in technology continue to accelerate, feeding the
increased pace of changing customer requirements.
Executives need to ﬁnd ways to solve today’s problems, such as:
– Challenge to address the changing needs of customers in a cost-effective way
– Costly, inﬂexible integration technologies that cause unacceptable risks to the enter-
prise
– Increasing complexity of IT environment
– Monolithic business applications that require expensive customization and mainte-
nance
– Getting locked into vendors’ products
– Complex automation of business processes that involve partners and customers with
inadequate security
– Lack of visibility and control into automated business processes for line-of-business
management

5.1 Web services paradigm – SOA
89
– Limited ability to participate in value networks because of complexity and insufﬁ-
cient security
Business is calling upon IT more than ever to respond quickly and efﬁciently to these
multiple and serious challenges.
In this tough environment enterprises highly welcome an evolutionary, standards-based
architectural approach, which addresses all of the issues mentioned above.
This approach is a web services based architecture known as Service-Oriented Archi-
tecture (SOA).
5.1 Web services paradigm – SOA
The Web Services Paradigm refers to the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), an
architecture that constitutes a distributed computing environment in which applications
call functionality from other applications either locally or remotely over an internal
network or an IP-network in a loosely-coupled way. 
Web services are self-contained, self-describing modular and autonomous applications.
They may be deployed intra-enterprise as an easier way of distributed computing or
published, located and invoked across the Internet. Web services published on the web
(software as a service) can be used by any application at any time. The web services
components will remain consistently regardless of various deployments.
The goal of web services is to enable application-to-application communication. This
is achieved by a document-oriented way of distributed computing.
The following aspects describe what makes up web services:
– The service is represented by software that is ﬁrst of all capable to process an XML
document it has received from an invoking application via any internal interface or
IP-network. The internal structure of this software as well as the realization of the
requested functionality does not play any role. Whether it is based on object-oriented
techniques or it operates as a stand-alone process or is a thin layered front-end of an
existing enterprise application, is not of any importance. This software only needs to
be capable of processing well-deﬁned XML documents and performing the func-
tionality requested in these documents.
– The XML document is the keystone of a web service, as it contains all the applica-
tion-speciﬁc information. This document is described using an XML scheme, and
the two applications that are engaged in the conversation need to have knowledge of
the same description in order to interprete and validate the document correctly. For
these descriptions the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is used. 
– The Address deﬁnes where the service can be found, i.e. a transport protocol (e.g.
TCP, HTTP, etc.) combined with a network address. 
– The Envelope encapsulates the XML document and some system information the
two communicating applications may want to exchange in the message. This system

information allows, for example, routing and security information to be added to the
message without the need to modify the XML document. The message protocol that
is used for almost all web services is SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). The
SOAP message consists of two possible elements: a soap-header, in which all the
system information is kept, and a soap-body, which contains the XML document that
is to be processed by the web service.
Service-oriented architectures
SOA describes a distributed application construction that has been in principle in use
for many years. CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture), in use since
the late eighties, promoted by the Object Management Group and mainly deployed in
telecommunication applications is one example. The DCOM (Distributed Component
Object Model) of Microsoft is another. Both concepts provide interface deﬁnition lan-
guages (IDL, MIDL) and tightly coupled distribution mechanisms that allow local or
remote invocations.
In principle, SOA allows designing applications that provide services to other applica-
tions through published and discoverable interfaces. In this sense SOA might be
deﬁned as an application architecture in which all functions are implemented as inde-
pendent services with well-deﬁned invokable interfaces, which can be called in
sequences to form business processes. 
However in contrast to CORBA and DCOM, SOA based on web services constitutes a
loosely coupled model, as depicted in ﬁgure 5.1, provides platform independency
(regarding the two camps, Java and Microsoft), as well as language, transport and mes-
sage format independency.
Figure 5.1 Independency of platforms

5.1 Web services paradigm – SOA
91
Moreover the passing through ﬁrewalls using HTTP is enabled, WSDL (Web Services
Description Language) is bound to the service it describes and the service is accessed
electronically at a location, which may not be known to the requester but can automat-
ically be discovered.
The SOA based on web services is characterized by the ability of publishing a service
on an IP-network in a registry. The network is either public (Internet) or private (enter-
prise). The registry is standardized, called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery
and Integration) and may be either public or private, too.
UDDI consists of an XML schema that deﬁnes four data structures: business deﬁnition,
service deﬁnition, binding speciﬁcation and programmatic interface as well as a set of
APIs that operate on those structures. 
The web services are described by the standardized WSDL. The WSDL listing is com-
prised of three elements: the white pages, which contain basic information about the
providing company and its services, the yellow pages, which organize services by
industry, service type and geography, ﬁnally the green pages, which include the techni-
cal mechanisms, i.e. how to ﬁnd (e.g. URL) and execute a web service.
The SOA provides in addition to the publishing two other signiﬁcant capabilities, that
are taken advantage of at runtime of an application that invoke a web service: the dis-
covery, the ability to ﬁnd a required functionality (service) and the binding, the ability
to connect automatically to this functionality.
Figure 5.2 shows the three corresponding roles: the web service provider, the web ser-
vice requester and the web service broker (UDDI).
After a web service is built by a web service provider and posted to a company’s or a
broker’s UDDI registry (P in the diagram) any invocation via the network can occur. 
Figure 5.2 Web services based service-oriented architecture 

5 Web services
92
A typical transaction ﬂow comprises 3 steps. The web service requester searches the
UDDI registry and ﬁnds a description of the desired service (1). The web service
requester then connects to the web service provider via the SOAP (Simple Object
Access Protocol) to obtain and activate the web service (2). After executing the web
service the deliverables are sent back again via SOAP to the web service requester (3),
where they are processed in the requester’s application.
Beneﬁts and limitations of SOA
Beniﬁcial aspects
The most important new aspect about web services and SOA is its ubiquitous support
by all major vendors. Most likely this is not at least due to some convincing advantages
such as:
– Flexibility in new software design
– Reuse of business components in networks
– Interoperability and integration capability
– Ease of assembling new business processes
Several recent developments in the software industry have helped to bring SOA for-
ward. With personalized, web-based, portal-style user interfaces over multiple channels
an increasing number of solutions require the reuse of application components. Differ-
ent users such as customers, employees, managers using many devices (laptops, PDAs,
smartphones) in different situations (home, ofﬁce, and hotel) all may request access to
the same set of business applications. The loosely coupled SOA provides the natural
basis for reuse of applications to multiple categories of clients. Thus, the transition to
multi-client and multi-channel applications pushes forward the web services based
software design.
No doubt, SOA will imply more competition and innovation of application develop-
ment. Best-of-breed business components can be encapsulated as autonomous web ser-
vices and be published to UDDI registries as reusable services with the accessibility of
the whole world. This will not only become an excellent business opportunity for smart
software start-ups, but also established vendors will tend to modularize their applica-
tion packages and offer components as web services via the Internet to more customers. 
Another fundamental need is the better interoperabilty of application platforms of dif-
ferent vendors such as IBM, Microsoft and SAP as well as the integration of enterprise
applications from different vendors or with home-grown applications. Many projects
have created programmatic interfaces to wrap legacy and other existing external func-
tionality for assembly into heterogeneous composite transactions. Composition and
integration of existing and new real-time transaction patterns are a natural ﬁt of SOA. 
SOA evolution of IT applications 
Probably the most desired value of SOA on the foundation of web services is its capa-
bility to assemble easily ad hoc processes and its representation of an enabling technol-

5.1 Web services paradigm – SOA
93
ogy for process integration. As shown in ﬁgure 5.3 this will lead to another architec-
tural split of business application layers.
The old monolithic application paradigm, characterized by unstructured and inﬂexible
applications, designed with 3rd and 4th generation program languages, running on
mainframe systems, supporting thumb, text oriented terminals has been replaced by a
2-tier client/server application paradigm in the late eighties.
As mentioned in chapter 2, ten years later another paradigm has emerged as the result
of signiﬁcant technology developments and business-related requirements: The web-
based e-business. The evolution of the Internet technology surely has become the main
driver to shift the IT architectures to today’s state-of-the-art multi-tier architectures.
This architecture comprises the presentation tier, providing mainly browser clients, the
business logic tier, which represents the centralized, functional and procedural applica-
tion and the resource tier containing databases, web content, legacy systems and other
corporate services like directory services. 
The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) on the foundation of web services now
enables a new paradigm for the design and operation of business applications: The sep-
aration into functions and processes. 
In this paradigm, business processes and activities can be supported efﬁciently by the
composition of coordinated web services, which may represent distinguished business
functionalities. The loosely coupled mechanisms of SOA in combination with a new
business process execution language (BPEL, details later) and workﬂow engines,
which control the deﬁned process ﬂows provide the ability to set up rapidly ad hoc pro-
cesses by leveraging components of existing applications and integrate them with new
web services.
However this paradigm, which can be described as a two level programming model
(function distinguished from process), will have signiﬁcant impacts on the design as
Figure 5.3 Evolution of IT application architectures

5 Web services
94
well as on the operation of applications. In the design phase the composition of web
services means new challenges concerning the solution architecture, the coordination
of services, and the handling and coordination of multi-services transactions. The oper-
ation of web services-based applications and processes also imply challenging issues,
such as quality of services, service level agreements, as well as web services and pro-
cess management.
Limits and open issues
SOA is neither a universal remedy for the multiple existing shortcomings in today’s
mix and match IT-architectures nor is it the solution for all upcoming challenges. 
Though SOA relays to a loosely coupled model it is probably not the best practice in
the case of long-running asynchronous processes. SOA’s natural strenghts rather lay in
real-time request-response exchanges (synchronous and asynchronous) than in more
event-driven processes. 
SOA requires an environmental framework, i.e. a state-of-the-art application platform,
such as Microsoft .NET, SAP NetWeaver, IBM WebSphere or BEA WebLogic. Unfor-
tunately a full platform independency has not yet been achieved.
Applications, whose business logic components are used in a closed application
domain or will be neither reused nor changed do not beneﬁt from SOA because of the
additional design and development effort. 
The most critical aspects of SOA and web services are still some pending security
issues. A more or less extensive framework of security-standards has been worked out,
not yet ﬁnished, and applicable products are available on the market now. But for mis-
sion critical processes embedding external web services via the Internet the existing
security measures are not sufﬁcient for the most cases. More details are covered in
chapter 6. 
Furthermore SOA and web services deployment are still critical where an application
requires the transactional handling of sequential request-response exchanges. In many
cases existing applications cannot be wrapped as web services that match the high level
of ACID (Atomicy, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactional processing.
Extended transactions therefore will become very important in the design phase. They
deﬁne how non-ACID transactions should be managed acceptably, if any events cause
that a transaction cannot be ﬁnished successfully. As an example, long-running activi-
ties can be structured as many independent, short-duration transactions to form a logi-
cal long-running transaction. 
Another critical aspect to be considered if deploying web services is the coordinated
collaboration of web services with old applications as well as the provisioning of com-
plex functionality achieved by the aggregation of various web services. Business pro-
cesses usually comprise various coordinated activities, where contexts, dependencies
and events have to be regarded. This requires a coordination framework with appropri-
ate coordination protocols to address those issues. Today there is little experience how
these challenges can be responded successfully.

5.2 Web services standardization
95
Finally there are some issues concerning the deployment of published web services in
mission critical enterprise application, such as trust, guaranteed availability and quality
levels, and the ability to negotiate contracts with sufﬁcient ﬂexibility.
Summary
In the long term the values of SOA are evidently. 
SOA
– leverages open standards to represent virtually all software assets as services includ-
ing legacy applications, packaged applications, J2EE components and web services
– effects that individual software assets become building blocks that can be reused in
developing other applications
– provides developers with a standard way of representing and interacting with soft-
ware assets without having to spend time working with unique interfaces and low-
level APIs
– helps reducing the complexity, cost, and risk of integration by providing a single,
simple architectural framework based on web services in which to build, deploy, and
manage application functionality.
SOA is useful in many aspects and should be part of the most forward-looking software
projects. Over time, the lack of SOA experience will become a competitive disadvan-
tage for many enterprises. They must understand the essence of SOA and web services
as well as their strenghts and limitations in order to be able to identify their roles in
modern application architectures and business solutions. 
5.2 Web services standardization
The web services standards and standard proposals can be structured as illustrated in
ﬁgure 5.4. The standards and protocols may be distinguished in three blocks: the
description/discovery block, the infrastructure and deployment block that contains
standards and protocols for deploying web services, and the web services implementa-
tion framework. For better understanding the various standard purposes, the infrastruc-
ture and deployment block is separated in the transport, messaging, quality of services
and processes/composition layer. 
Standards that serve as a basis for creating and using web services have been deployed
since several years. These include SOAP, the extensible XML-based protocol for
exchanging information in distributed, heterogeneous system environments, WSDL for
describing call interfaces and UDDI for registering and locating web services as well as
the underlying transport protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, and others. 
A series of extended standards is necessary in order to realize the vision of a business
web, where web services can be used as application components and combined dynam-
ically in order to represent new business processes. What is needed are enabling ser-

5 Web services
96
vices, protocols and languages, which guarantee quality levels for reliable message
transport, for security and transaction processing, for monitoring and accounting, for
collaboration and orchestration. These extended services are essential for ensuring the
secure, permanent, reliable and coordinated use of web services.
Extended services are primarily deﬁned, speciﬁed and prototyped by well known ven-
dors such as IBM, Microsoft, SAP, BEA, and Sun. Bodies like OASIS (Organization
for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) and the standardization
organization W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) are continuing to drive these technol-
ogies until a standard is concluded.
Global XML Web Services Architecture
An important step of the web services standardization development was Microsoft’s
publication of a speciﬁcation called Global XML Web Services Architecture (GXA) at
the end of 2001 [5.2.1]. This speciﬁcation was then extended with the assistance of
other vendors during the course of the last years with concrete standards and protocols
being added.
According to Microsoft, GXA is based on four design principles: 
– Modular 
GXA uses the extensibility of the SOAP speciﬁcation to deliver a set of composable
modules that can be combined as needed to deliver end-to-end capabilities. As new
capabilities are required, new modular elements can be created. 
Figure 5.4 Web services standards and standard proposals

5.2 Web services standardization
97
– General Purpose
GXA is designed for a wide range of XML web services scenarios, ranging from
B2B and EAI solutions to peer-to-peer applications and B2C services. 
– Federated
GXA is fully distributed and designed to support XML web services that cross orga-
nizational and trust boundaries and do not require centralized servers or administra-
tive functions. 
– Standards-based
As with previous XML web services speciﬁcations, GXA protocols will be submit-
ted to appropriate standard bodies and Microsoft will work with interested parties to
complete their standardization.
Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I)
IBM and Microsoft formed the web services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) in
2002 in a bid to ensure the interoperability of web services implementations from dif-
ferent vendors. The aim of the WS-I organization [5.2.2] is to link various web services
approaches with each other. WS-I provides guidelines, best-practice examples, tools
and test environments for ensuring that web services can communicate with each other
across platform and vendor boundaries. Furthermore, WS-I provides a so-called basic
proﬁle, which contains implementation guidelines and recommendations as to how
interoperable web services can be created on the basis of the core technologies and pro-
tocols (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, XML and XML Scheme Deﬁnition, XSD).
Currently deﬁned standards and discussed proposals
The web services standardization is an ongoing process. Actual information about web
services standards is available on the web [5.2.3].
Some of the important web services standards and proposed speciﬁcations, which are
shown in ﬁgure 5.4 are described brieﬂy as follows:
WS-Inspection
The WS-Inspection speciﬁcation provides an XML format for assisting in the inspec-
tion of a site for available services and a collection of rules for how inspection related
information should be made available for consumption. A WS-Inspection document
provides a means for aggregating references to pre-existing service description docu-
ments which have been authored in any number of formats. These inspection docu-
ments are then made available at the point-of-offering of the service as well as through
references which may be placed within a content medium such as HTML.
WS-PolicyFramework 
The WS-PolicyFramework deﬁnes a general purpose model and corresponding syntax
to describe and communicate web services policies so that service consumers can dis-
cover the necessary information to get access to services from a service provider.

5 Web services
98
WS-Attachments
This speciﬁcation deﬁnes an abstract model for SOAP attachments and based on this
model deﬁnes a mechanism for encapsulating a SOAP message and attachments in a
DIME message (Direct Internet Message Encapsulation). It makes no sense in some
application scenarios to transfer pure XML-coded data to a web service: For example,
if a picture or a graphic is to be included as an attachment, or in the case of nested
SOAP messages. DIME speciﬁes how such attachments can be packaged and WS-
Attachments deﬁne how DIME-coded attachments should be handled in the SOAP pro-
tocol.
WS-Addressing
WS-Adressing provides transport-neutral mechanisms to address web services and
messages. Particularly, this speciﬁcation deﬁnes XML elements to identify web service
endpoints and to secure end-to-end endpoint identiﬁcation in messages. This speciﬁca-
tion enables messaging systems to support message transmission through networks that
include processing nodes such as endpoint managers, ﬁrewalls, and gateways in a
transport-neutral manner. 
WS-Routing
WS-Routing is required for transporting messages via a dynamically conﬁgured net-
work path. An alternative return path and any intermediate stations can be speciﬁed for
the messages along the network path. The model for intermediaries may support direct
identiﬁcation or a description of the type of service that a selected intermediary can
perform.
WS-Referral
WS-Referral extends the WS-Routing concept. WS-Referral is required for the routing
and administration of routing directories stored on the intermediate nodes. The reason
for this is that web services communication (exchange of requests and responses) only
takes place directly between two neighboring computer nodes in exceptional cases. In
most cases the communication path will extend over a number of intermediate nodes,
depending on the network topology and the deﬁned fallback routes.
WS-Security
WS-Security describes SOAP extensions for guaranteeing the integrity, conﬁdentiality
and authentication of SOAP messages. Furthermore, the handling of security tokens is
also deﬁned. More detail about WS-Security and other security standards in this con-
text are explained in chapter 6.
WS-ReliableMessaging
This speciﬁcation describes a protocol that allows messages to be delivered reliably
between distributed applications in the presence of software component, system, or

5.2 Web services standardization
99
network failures. The protocol is described in this speciﬁcation in an independent man-
ner allowing it to be implemented using different network transport technologies. To
support interoperable web services, a SOAP binding is deﬁned within this speciﬁca-
tion.
WS-Coordination
This speciﬁcation describes a framework for providing protocols that coordinate the
actions of distributed applications. Such coordination protocols are used to support a
number of applications, including those that need to reach consistent agreement on the
outcome of distributed transactions. The framework enables an application service to
create a context needed to propagate an activity to other services and to register for
coordination protocols. The framework enables existing transaction processing, work-
ﬂow, and other systems for coordination to hide their proprietary protocols and to oper-
ate in a heterogeneous environment. Additionally, this speciﬁcation describes a deﬁni-
tion of the structure of context and the requirements for propagating context between
cooperating services.
WS-Transaction
WS-Transaction was deﬁned in conjunction with WS-Coordination. WS-Transaction
guarantees a consistent status across all participating processes and data at any point in
time. WS-Transaction distinguishes between two different coordination instances:
Atomic Transaction and Business Activity. An ‘Atomic Transaction’ involves commu-
nication by processes with very short runtimes within a closed application domain. A
‘Business Activity’ involves cross-company business process procedures that are pro-
cessed asynchronously over a longer period (long-living transactions).
Business Processes
The tough struggle for vendors in accomplishing their web services technologies is
demonstrated using the example of speciﬁcations for cross-company business process
communication. There are a number of contending proposals in relation to this topic,
each with a somewhat different focus and speciﬁcation depth. 
The Business Process Modeling Language (BPML) was published 2002 by the Busi-
ness Process Management Initiative. This initiative covered more than a dozen well-
known vendors, such as BEA, CSC, HP, IBM, SAP, and Sun. BPML allows a com-
pany’s business processes to be modeled across all levels. Every individual action of a
process can be deﬁned, even in the case of complex, cross-company business pro-
cesses. Business processes are depicted as graphical objects that can be changed via a
simple user interface.
BEA, SAP, and Sun developed an XML-based speciﬁcation, the Web Services Chore-
ography Interface (WSCI), which describes dynamic interfaces for web services, via
which data can be exchanged using static business rules.

5 Web services
100
Microsoft developed its proprietory business process language XLANG used with its
BizTalk integration and orchestration server and IBM developed the web services Flow
Language (WSFL). 
Finally IBM and Microsoft have used their developments (WSFL and XLANG) as a
basis for developing three complementary speciﬁcations together with BEA, i.e. WS-
Coordination, WS-Transaction and the Business Process Execution Language for Web
services (BPEL4WS or short BPEL) in order to regulate the workﬂow between service-
based business processes. Cascadable web services may be created, which for example
allow ﬂights, rental cars and hotel rooms to be booked within one consistent process. If
the ﬂight is cancelled, the hotel reservation and the rental car are cancelled automati-
cally with the assistance of a compensation transaction and the user will be informed
accordingly. 
In the meantime more or less all major software vendors will support BPEL and
Microsoft has announced a migration path from XLANG to BPEL. Therefore BPEL
probably has the best chance to become the cross-enterprise business process language
standard. 
WS-CAF
The purpose of this recently initiated OASIS WS-CAF (Web services Composite Appli-
cation Framework) Technical Committee [5.2.4] is to deﬁne a royalty-free, generic and
open framework for supporting applications that contain multiple web services used in
combination (composite applications).
Framework for web services implementation
OASIS members have formed a new Framework for Web Services Implementation
(FWSI) Technical Committee [5.2.5] to produce guidelines that assist system integra-
tors and software vendors in implementing web services solutions. The purpose is to
facilitate implementation of robust web services by deﬁning a practical and extensible
methodology. It will comprise implementation processes and common functional ele-
ments that enterprises can adopt to create high quality web services systems without re-
inventing them for each implementation. It attempts to solve the problem of the slow
adoption of web services due to lack of methodologies to implement web services, and
lack of understanding of whether solutions proposed by vendors have the necessary
components to implement reliably an application based on web services.
Standardization outlook 
The major software vendors and standardization organizations have shown a strong
interest to cooperate in developing web services standards because they all recognized
that web services can only gain broad acceptance with adequate mechanisms to guar-
antee interoperability.
However the standardization is an ongoing process with frequently extended versions
and additional discovered new ﬁelds where standardization is needed. Examples are

5.3 Web services impacts
101
web services security, policy, provisioning, long-running transaction, federation, com-
position, orchestration and management.
Some of the mentioned standard proposals are vendor proposals but not yet taken up by
standardization organizations (e.g. federation). Unfortunately involved players have
different business interests that cause overlapping or disagreement of standard propos-
als preventing uniﬁed deployment and interoperability.
5.3 Web services impacts
Web services have the potential to drive the next evolutionary step in the development
of the Internet, the business web. They will offer the greatest beneﬁts for communica-
tion between enterprises (B2B) for enabling the implementation of complex, dynamic,
cross-enterprise business process operations. They will help to automate the processing
of order, delivery and payment transactions. Thanks to simple implementation and the
use of widely known standards, web services should also allow small and medium-
sized companies to participate in e-business. Unless security, web services do not
require a sophisticated new IT-infrastructure and networking, they rather may be
embedded in existing environments as shown in ﬁgure 5.5.
Two partner enterprises A and B are shown that access different external web services
(payment processing, dispatch logistics). These may be chargeable services offered by
a web service provider. In addition both enterprises access an external authentication
web service in order to be able to authenticate to the web service provider and to each
Figure 5.5 Web services embedded in existing IT infrastructure

102
other. Moreover, enterprise A provides a web service that allows enterprise B to query
the current inventory from the purchasing application. Both enterprises use appropriate
application servers with a component application model. These application servers are
capable based on web services standards to invoke and run web services in combina-
tion with component applications, such as purchasing, accounting, security, etc.
Though web services may be embedded in existing IT-infrastructure there will be sig-
niﬁcant impacts on the one hand on the shaping of middleware as well as on the total
architecture of business applications on the other hand. This is mainly due to the facts
that web services technology will create more competition, more standardized autono-
mous business functions as well as enable more ﬂexibility to react to changing market
requirements.
The Internet, SOA and web services will become the foundation for B2B, B2C and
B2E e-business.
As depicted in ﬁgures 5.6 and 5.7 ﬁve trends are of signiﬁcant importance and will
change the architecture of e-business solutions:
Increasing middleware on application platforms (trend 1)
Today’s appropriate application server support the basic web services standards, i.e.
provide web services container that are able to run web services and offer tools to
develop web services or to wrap existing applications to be deployed as web services. 
Standard applications such as SCM, ERP, CRM are farreaching isolated from each
other but do perform some common horizontal functions, e.g. security, personalization,
user management, identity management and others. Some of these functions may be
soon provided by application platforms in the form of web services, which can be
Figure 5.6 Web services impacts (1)

5.3 Web services impacts
103
invoked by the standard applications whenever they need to perform these functions.
Obviously this will help to increase productivity of enterprises and will free develop-
ment resources of standard software vendors so that they are able to focus more on
innovative functions to improve their software packages. 
Platform interoperability (trend 2)
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, IT executives are under pressure to
improve the interoperability of different vendors’ platforms and applications. Interop-
erability should be achieved on all three server levels, the portal, the application and the
integration server. 
An enterprise may provide access for multiple user groups via different portals but the
groups may use equally applications, services or enterprise resources. Web services
constitute an adequate technology to achieve this interoperability in future sytems.
With the WSRP (Web Services for Remote Portals) standard, content from other sources
or applications running on other platforms can be integrated as remote portlets. As
WSRP include presentation, service providers determine how their content and appli-
cations are visualized for end-users. Therefore the integration is easily done and portal
designers are not required to make any manual content- or application-speciﬁc adapta-
tion.
Common portal services such as authentication, location based services and billing ser-
vices will be implemented as web services, platform independently and therefore
deployable from different enterprise portals. Enterprise resources, e.g. web content or
database information will be made available to the multiple user groups by standard-
ized web services that response to the user’s queries.
State-of-the-art application server support the basic web services standards and provide
tools to develop web services as well as they are equipped with containers to run web
services. Interoperability between platforms of different vendors by deploying com-
mon web services and by web services based interaction between applications will
become mainstream. Another standard will improve the interoperability among J2EE
platforms. The web service for J2EE (JSR109) architecture is a service architecture
which leverages the J2EE component architecture to provide a decoupled client server
programming model which is portable across J2EE application servers.
Emerging web services (trend 3)
The web services paradigm will push the e-business by implying more competition and
innovation of application development. Best-of-breed business components can be
encapsulated as autonomous web services and published to UDDI registries as reusable
services with the accessibility of the whole world. As shown in ﬁgure 5.7 this means an
enrichment of automated business functions as well as the capability to integrate those
functions in well deﬁned business processes. 
Publishing web services will become a new chance for smart software start-ups to offer
best-of-breed business functions. Even more important, the established business stand-

5 Web services
104
ard application vendors, such as SAP, Peoplesoft or Siebel will modularize their appli-
cation packages and offer components as web services via the Internet.
Moreover proprietary industry speciﬁc applications will be supplemented or replaced
by vertical web services, which may be offered by software vendors or by companies
of the manufacturing, chemical, transportation, or any other industry that are interested
to publish such an industry speciﬁc web service, e.g. for better collaboration with their
business partners.
Business process integration – the real-time enterprise (trend 4) 
To be successful in today’s rapidly changing market, enterprises require solutions that
allow integrating business processes across different vertical markets and various
application platforms. Effective business integration enables disparate business
resources to work together, both inside and outside an enterprise, to support a com-
pany’s business strategy.
To meet these crucial challenges enterprises must be able to optimize processes by
combining and correlating functions from today’s distinguished applications such as
ERP, SCM, e-commerce and vertical applications. The integration and exploitation of
isolated applications enable cross-functional processes to obtain real-time results.
Business process integration in this sense is the way to become a real-time enterprise. 
Ad hoc business processes (trend 5)
Enterprises face a number of challenges in order to address the continual changes tak-
ing place in the market today. They need to adapt new business rules, ﬁnancial models
and industry position to ﬁnd new ways to acquire and keep customers. They should
Figure 5.7 Web services impacts (2)

5.3 Web services impacts
105
develop new business, enter new markets, create new sales models and build new and
efﬁcient electronic purchasing channels while integrating existing ones.
The dynamics of e-business today demand business agility to adapt rapidly to new mar-
ket forces and opportunities. Enterprises must be able to seize market opportunities and
provide appropriate service level management to exceed customer expectations. They
have to offer continually value-added differential to their customers, on price, service
or any other value that meets customers’ needs. 
This means companies must be able to set up ad hoc processes very quickly in order to
adapt to new market requirements, e.g., the exploitation of existing CRM functionality
and industry-speciﬁc applications in combination with web services orchestrated in a
shortly arranged workﬂow may increase the level of agility substantially.
Business integration with web services
According to the trends depicted, enterprises will be forced to focus increasingly on
business integration and business process management deploying web services tech-
nology.
As shown in ﬁgure 5.8, business integration comprises four integration levels:
– User integration (including customers, business partners and employees)
– Integration of internal and external applications
– Integration of information, including content- and knowledge-management
– Process integration: integration of internal and external processes
Figure 5.8 Business integration with web services

5 Web services
106
User integration increasingly takes account of personal requirements as well as of the
context of each user and the enhanced needs in terms of mobility and security. At the
same time, it permits more efﬁcient collaboration, with the result that time-critical pro-
cesses can be signiﬁcantly improved. Integration is achieved by portlets which simply
can be adapted to portal frameworks and by the emerging WSRP standard. Services
such as user management, roles, personalization may be increasingly provided as por-
tal related web services.
In the case of application integration, the time-consuming concept of point-to-point
integration is replaced by high-performance integration servers with a wide range of
connectors, component and message brokers and, in the long term, by web services.
The integration of information may be achieved on the metadata level by standards that
include the Java Metadata Interface (JMI) and XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) and
in addition by support of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), which allows generic
access to a wide variety of applications as well as XML for analysis (XMLA), which
deﬁnes a similar API based on SOAP and XML. Beyond pure messaging functionality
a centralized integration knowledge- and content-management is useful. Beside a more
efﬁcient management the beneﬁt of centralizing is the ability to deliver built-in content,
such as business scenarios, business process deﬁnitions, and mappings. 
The integration of internal and external business processes, as well as the realization of
ad hoc processes, which have to be implemented quickly (in a few days) in response to
changing requirements, will play an important role in the future. In this ﬁeld, web ser-
vices will establish themselves as the underlying technology, provided that the security
mechanisms for cross-enterprise communications, some of which are currently only
partially implemented, can be extended sufﬁciently to ﬁnd widespread acceptance. 
In the past, individual business processes were supported by separate applications. This
has frequently resulted in the creation of isolated solutions which, although internally
optimized, contribute insufﬁciently to overall requirements. The integration technolo-
gies that are now available permit a more efﬁcient and simultaneously more ﬂexible
integration of the entire existing and future application landscape both within and
between companies.
Business process management
Business Process Management (BPM) is a methodology, as well as a collection of tools
that enable enterprises to specify step-by-step business processes. Proper analysis and
design of BPM ﬂows require a strong understanding of the single business steps that
must be performed to complete a business process. As BPM executes a business pro-
cess, these steps will often correspond to well-known business activities, such as
checking credit ratings, updating customer accounts and checking inventory status.
Effectively, the BPM process ﬂow is often just a sequence of well-known services, exe-
cuted in a coordinated way.
An efﬁcient method to design business solutions more ﬂexibly is to separate business
process ﬂows from business logic implementation by deploying the SOA (loosely cou-
pled web services) in combination with a process execution language, e.g. BPEL.

5.3 Web services impacts
107
BPEL exclusively uses web service interfaces when exporting and importing messages.
Separating business process ﬂows from business application logic provides process
independence. It deﬁnes what needs to be done, when and how, by whom or by which
application. This separation-concept enables the integration of business processes, by
combining functions from distinguished applications, e.g. representing an optimized
workﬂow of order processing. This separation-concept enables the ﬂexibility to create
ad hoc new processes which may increase enterprise’s agility farreaching indepen-
dently from underlying organizational and IT resources that support these processes.
The predecessor of BPM, the classic document workﬂow, focused on humans perform-
ing the services. Enabled by the advanced integration of applications, BPM can com-
bine both human and automated agents doing the work to deliver the services but now
focussing on the automation part. SOA is an architectural approach that thrives on turn-
ing enterprise computing assets into well-deﬁned services. It is a natural ﬁt with BPM
because of this reliance on services. SOA exposes services, and BPM, which demands
process ﬂow completion, consumes services. If done properly, SOA opens a vast inven-
tory of services for BPM to glue together into a comprehensive ﬂow.
Agility is obvious, ﬂow and service exist independently, and each brings its own ﬂexi-
bility. A ﬂow can be changed and can incorporate new services. New services can be
created and then composed via BPM into new composite applications.
Effective BPM solutions return control of business processes back to business people
from information technology people. This means that line-of-business managers can
change business processes and quickly adapt them to changing market conditions.
BPM also provides decision makers with up-to-date business information, allowing
them to make better business decisions immediately.
As depicted in chapter 3, forward-looking integration servers offer such BPM model-
ing and simulation tools as well as workﬂow engines, which are able to execute busi-
ness processes.
Web services management
The business oriented management of web services is aimed at supporting critical
applications that require enterprises or IT service providers to manage the service plat-
form, the deployment of services, applications, and processes. Web services manage-
ment products must provide the critical infrastructure necessary for companies to take
their ﬁne-grained, atomic web services and other data sources and compose them into
coarse-grained business services that make up a service-oriented architecture. 
Once web services technology consolidates and an increasing number of web services
becomes available the attention of the management issues will be obvious. Enterprises
will soon require tools that support and automate their web services management
efforts. So far neither the scope nor the standardization in this area has been well
deﬁned and developed. However the interest in this area is demonstrated by recent
standardization proposals. OASIS therefore has formed the Technical Committee Web
services Distributed Management (WSDM) [5.3.1] to bring forward the management
issue. 

5 Web services
108
Web services management is essential for enterprises, which operate their applications
and processes by themselves. But it is even more important for IT and BPO service
providers and there are functional extensions needed.
The scope of web services management may comprise:
– Infrastructure and application management
– Monitoring and metrics
– Security and certiﬁcation services
– Service level agreements, billing and ﬁnancial services, contract management.
Infrastructure and application-level management are extensions to traditional manage-
ment functions due to the fact that web services constitute an additional layer on top of
state-of-the-art middleware.
Monitoring service execution means monitoring business interactions with partners
and customers. Enterprises are under increasing pressure to measure the value of their
IT investments and from a business perspective need to gain visibility into IT opera-
tions. The holistic view of service interactions is of particular beneﬁt and metrics will
help to evaluate and improve web services based business processes. 
With an increasing number of published web services from sources that are more or
less unknown, security, availability, and trust will become top issues for enterprises.
The certiﬁcation of those services as well as guaranteeing the quality of services may
become interesting management subjects for IT and outsourcing service providers.
Moreover appropriate service level agreements, billing and ﬁnancial services, and the
management of contracts concerning web services based solutions are challenging new
business opportunities for such service providers.
5.4 Forward-looking SOA based application platforms
The major application platform vendors already have adopted the web services tech-
nology and currently evolve their platforms to SOA. Examples are shown in the follow-
ing section.
5.4.1 SAP NetWeaver
SAP’s NetWeaver platform [5.4.1] is an example of a forward-looking application plat-
form demonstrating the coexistence of both the traditional application world (SAP R/3,
mySAP) and the new SOA/web services paradigm.
In the 1990s, SAP captured the leading position in the world market for business soft-
ware, primarily with its ERP software SAP R/3. By the end of the 90s, this position was
threatened by a number of quickly growing software providers with internet-based,
enterprise-wide solutions which were initially received very positively by the market
(e.g. Ariba, Commerce One, i2, Siebel). SAP responded to this by developing its
mySAP technology and then successively extended its offering with CRM, SCM and

5.4 Forward-looking SOA based application platforms
109
further components. Today, SAP is recognized as a market leader in these ﬁelds of
application, too.
The latest challenge now is to implement a service-oriented architecture (SOA) in the
future solutions landscape, using web services as the basic technology. SAP has
responded to this development ﬁrstly by supporting web services in mySAP compo-
nents and, in autumn 2002, with the announcement of its xApps technology. xApps
enables cross-functional processes to be generated, based on existing and also on non-
SAP systems, which link information and functions of different applications with each
other so as to obtain efﬁciently the required results and workﬂows.
Enterprise Services Architecture (ESA) and the NetWeaver platform
Following the announcement of its technology platform NetWeaver in 2003, SAP now
has enforced end-to-end SOA support and at the same time has undergone a signiﬁcant
shift in its business strategy. On the one hand, SAP has moved into the world of tech-
nology and platform providers to be at least partly in direct competition with
Microsoft, IBM, BEA, and Sun. On the other hand, SAP is abandoning its old approach
of exclusively backing an end-to-end SAP solution world for its customers. SAP is
shifting its emphasis much more toward standards (Java, XML, web services) while
focusing on the interoperability and integration of NetWeaver platforms and applica-
tions with middleware products from strategically important partners, such as
Microsoft and IBM.
NetWeaver provides the IT basis for a service-oriented architecture. This is designated
by SAP as an Enterprise Services Architecture (ESA). ESA is intended to provide the
basis for ﬂexible and extensible business solutions in heterogeneous IT landscapes, but
can also be taken as a basic concept for complete business integration. SAP envisages
that ESA will extend the web services paradigm to enterprise-class business architec-
ture. In this sense ESA is a blueprint for comprehensive, service-based business appli-
cations.
SAP deﬁnes ESA as follows:
– ESA empowers all people participating in a business process, both inside and outside
the enterprise,
– ESA encompasses all information relevant to the process,
– ESA integrates all systems important to the process – independent of being internal
or external, SAP or non-SAP.
ESA enables the design of a complete solution for a process. It provides the architec-
tural framework for process modeling and for the application of web services by inte-
grating them into existing solution landscapes. This should put businesses in a position
in which they can adapt business processes quickly and efﬁciently to change and react
ﬂexibly to new market requirements.
In future, all SAP solutions such as SAP R/3 enterprise, all mySAP solutions and all
xApps will be developed in line with the ESA concept.

5 Web services
110
NetWeaver provides SAP with the technological basis it needs to implement the ESA
vision. Two aspects of the NetWeaver/ESA concept must be differentiated, in order to
understand it as a whole. These aspects are reﬂected in the combined functionalities of
the NetWeaver platform, that is to say, in their variants
– as a runtime and integration platform for existing and new SAP applications,
– as an open interoperability and integration platform with a special focus on interop-
erability with IBM’s WebSphere and Microsoft’s .NET technologies.
Runtime and integration platform for SAP solutions
As a platform for all current and future SAP solutions, NetWeaver offers a number of
new functions and integration functions that are used in full or in part by the various
SAP solutions. This impacts both the further development of SAP R/3 Enterprise ver-
sions as well as the mySAP and xApps solutions as shown in ﬁgure 5.9.
The SAP R/3 enterprise solution will use the new NetWeaver functions (e.g. the portal)
via so-called extensions. Solutions based on mySAP technology, which are available as
isolated solutions (e.g. mySAP ERP) or as bundled solutions (e.g. mySAP Business
Suite, mySAP Smart Business Solutions), will also gradually be able to use the
NetWeaver functionality. SAP is expected to deﬁne and implement the migration of its
solutions to the NetWeaver platform in separate stages in its product and release strat-
egy.
Some of NetWeaver’s key functions are also offered as individual components. These
key functions include, in addition to the Web Application Server (WAS), the Enterprise
Portal Server and the Exchange Infrastructure (XI), additional components used by
many SAP applications.
Figure 5.9 SAP NetWeaver

5.4 Forward-looking SOA based application platforms
111
Here is a short description of these key elements:
– Portal infrastructure
is available as the component mySAP Enterprise Portal and enables a uniﬁed, per-
sonalized and role-based access of users, partners as well as employees to the con-
nected heterogeneous IT-environment.
– Collaboration
provides the dynamic real-time communication among teams or ﬂexibly established
communities. It comprises features such as common access to e-mails, calendar,
chat-rooms and storage of commonly used documents.
– Multichannel access
is part of the component mySAP Mobile Business and comprises the connection to
the enterprise applications and resources via ﬁxed or wireless networks. It includes
voice and data services.
– Knowledge management
provides user-oriented services, which enable access to the content management sys-
tem of SAP or third parties. Integrated tools support search, taxonomy, classiﬁcation
and information publishing as well as correlated workﬂows.
– Business intelligence
The mySAP Business Intelligence component allows the analysis, distribution and
integration of relevant information in real-time. It offers a tool set, which relieves the
design of interactice, individual reports and applications.
– Master data management
enables the integrity of data comprising the whole heteregeneous IT infrastructure of
an enterprise. It allows the harmonization of the core data over the heterogenous sys-
tem landscape.
– Exchange infrastructure
The component SAP Exchange-Infrastruktur comprises the Integration Server and
the Business Process Management and provides the necessary integration methods
and tools for the integration of SAP applications as well as 3rd party applications.
(More details later in this section)
– Application platform
The component SAP Web Application Server is the runtime environment of all SAP
applications. It supports SAP’s key technologies ABAP (SAP’s object-oriented pro-
gramming language) and J2EE. This enables to protect effected investments and in
addition provides the openness for future applications based on open standards. An
integrated web services framework supports platform-independent web services.
The security framework provides features such as single sign-on, role-based authori-
zation, centralized user management, secure and encrypted data exchange and
ﬁnally support of digital signatures and public key infrastructures. 
– Lifecycle management
This component supports the software-cycles, including design, implementation,
test, versioning, maintenance. SAP has decided to take the open-source-framework
Eclipse as the basis for their Java development environment. 

5 Web services
112
Open interoperability and integration platform
Medium-sized companies and in particular large companies are increasingly opting to
use SAP, IBM and Microsoft as their main providers for their technological infrastruc-
ture and business solutions. A crucial factor in determining the overall costs is how well
middleware and applications of the various manufacturers work together. This is why
there has been increased pressure on these three software manufacturers to improve
interoperability.
SAP has come up with an effective response to this challenge with its open interopera-
bility and integration platform, NetWeaver. NetWeaver supports important standards
promoted by international organizations, such as W3C, the Web Services Interoperabil-
ity Organization (WS-I), the Java Community Process (JCP) and OASIS.
Furthermore, SAP has negotiated agreements for close cooperation with IBM and
Microsoft, to improve the interoperability of their middleware products and technolo-
gies. As a result, interoperability components, interfaces, and to a certain extent inte-
gration projects will continue to be produced and extended.
As depicted in ﬁgure 5.10 the interoperability efforts with IBM WebSphere and
Microsoft .NET encompass joint support of important interoperability standards as well
as interoperability on different levels:
– Application and development platform
Like the corresponding platforms available from IBM and Microsoft, SAP Web
Application Server (WAS) supports a series of open standards (XML, SOAP,
WSDL, UDDI etc.). Bidirectional communication to J2EE applications is supported
by means of the SAP Java Connector (JCo) and to .NET via the SAP .NET connec-
Figure 5.10 NetWeaver – Interoperability with IBM WebSphere and Microsoft .NET

5.4 Forward-looking SOA based application platforms
113
tor. Customers who use WebSphere or .NET can therefore access existing business
objects and integrate these in SAP applications. In their Java development environ-
ments, SAP and IBM both base their solutions on the Eclipse Open Source frame-
work, thus resulting in greater interoperability with WebSphere Studio Application
Developer. The SAP .NET connector also provides support for the Visual Basic
development environment.
– Portal level
SAP will support the recently introduced WSRP (Web Services for Remote Portlets)
standard and ensure compatibility with the Java Portlet Standard JSR 168. In this
way, the portal can accept transparent portlets created in other development environ-
ments. SAP is developing Portal Developer Kits for IBM WebSphere and Microsoft
.NET. This will enable developers to develop portal services in a WebSphere or
.NET environment and embed these in the SAP portal. At the same time, SAP has
made available XML schemes for some hundreds of BAPIs (proprietary SAP inter-
faces). This means that the corresponding SAP applications can be easily embedded
in WebSphere or .NET environments using Web services. 
– Collaboration
IBM and SAP cooperate on integrating Lotus Sametime (instant messaging, web
conferences, and virtual teamrooms). Interaction with data from Microsoft
Exchange and Ofﬁce as well as with Lotus Domino is available already.
– Data, analysis and information tiers
Microsoft’s SQL Server Analysis Services can be used as multidimensional data-
stores in SAP Business Warehouse (BW). Corresponding management tools are inte-
grated in the two systems. At the metadata level, SAP provides data integration
based on JMI (Java Messaging Interface) and XMI (XML Metadata Interchange).
OLE-DB for OLAP and XMLA (XML for analysis) for analytical purposes are also
supported.
SAP KM (Knowledge Management) supports standards for accessing, interacting
and preparing unstructured information and provides open APIs that permit connec-
tions with other repositories. Integration scenarios involving the SAP KM repository
framework and IBM’s and Microsoft’s content management systems currently are
examined.
Exchange Infrastructure
Nevertheless SAP’s Exchange Infrastructure constitutes the centerpiece of the
NetWeaver interoperability features and particularly comprises the business process
management.
The Exchange Infrastructure (XI) is SAP’s integration server. It forms part of most
SAP solutions but can also be obtained as a separate unit in the form of the SAP
Exchange Infrastructure.
The Exchange Infrastructure provides a number of adapters for interoperability pur-
poses. These include a JMS adapter for interoperability with WebSphere Business Inte-
gration (MQSeries), or partner adapters to Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) and
BizTalk. As of 2004 it provides an adapter framework based on the Java Connector

5 Web services
114
Architecture (JCA). It will be possible to integrate third-party JCA adapters into this
framework, for example those supplied by IBM which already offers a number of them.
However, SAP does not intend to develop these adapters.
As shown in ﬁgure 5.11 the Exchange Infrastructure consists of the integration server
runtime system and the associated integration knowledge that is stored in the Integra-
tion Directory and Integration Repository. The integration server conducts
XML/SOAP-based communication between application components from various
SAP sources or sources from other suppliers.
The integration directory contains information that is required at runtime, for example
interfaces such as BAPIs, IDocs, (i.e. SAP proprietary interfaces), RFCs (Remote
Function Calls), mappings, routing rules, addresses and workﬂows. Integration sce-
narios and business processes are stored in the integration repository during develop-
ment. The repository already contains a range of scenarios and processes for the inte-
gration of SAP applications. Partners and customers may add others as required,
including third-party applications. 
The Exchange Infrastructure runs only on SAP’s Web Application Server but is
increasingly being positioned as an open integration platform, e.g. through support for
the industry standard RosettaNet, Chemical Industry Data Exchange (CIDX) or Petro-
leum Industry Data Exchange (PIDX). Moreover it supports an open adapter frame-
work based on JCA, and may include partner proﬁles in the integration directory and
offers a connection tool for SMBs (Small and Medium Business). 
Figure 5.11 SAP Exchange Infrastructure – Business process management

5.4 Forward-looking SOA based application platforms
115
The major functional extension of the latest release consists of the advanced business
process management. It now permits the combination of applications to form so-called
adaptive processes which can comprise an entire value-added chain.
The BPM consists of the following components: Integration Builder, Integration
Repository, Integration Directory, and Business Process Engine.
The Integration Builder is SAP’s process modeling tool, supports BPEL, permits the
import and export of process deﬁnitions and enables the integration of business sce-
narios and business processes. As already mentioned scenarios and processes are stored
in the Integration Repository. The Business Process Engine forms part of the XI Inte-
gration Server and controls the process steps in accordance with the ﬂows deﬁned in
the Integration Directory.
An open issue is how secure cross-enterprise processes can be implemented.
xAPPS
xApps are a new breed of applications, embedded in the NetWeaver platform, that are
designed to enable both business improvement and innovation. With abilities to com-
bine existing heterogeneous systems into cross-functional, end-to-end processes,
xApps may align people, information, and business processes for increased competi-
tive agility. It means greater agility for adapting to changing business realities spanning
corporate units and business partners. It also means to get the most out of what already
exists: employees, knowledge, products, business relationships, IT solutions and other
assets.
Developed by SAP but also by selected partners, xApps will target cross-functional
business processes. xApps families will include e.g. enterprise change management,
product portfolio management, employee relationship management, and employee ser-
vices automation, to name only a few, and the families are expected to grow rapidly.
Furthermore xApps are becoming a promising way to implement best-of-breed appli-
cations.
The design targets of the xApps paradigm have been
– to snap in existing infrastructure with different back-end systems
– to take full advantage of the evolving NetWeaver platform
– to guarantee consistency across user experience as well as across objects and ser-
vices that are stored underneath
– to support semi-structured or ad hoc processes.
The architectural approach of xApps comprises
– a model-driven approach. Everything is modeled in one single repository and then
the code is generated out: the UI, the integration proxies, the content of all other
repositories that are able to be integrated. In that way new platform features can eas-
ily be adopted. 

5 Web services
116
– the service-oriented architecture, which enables xApps to use existing business
objects, application logic, persistence services, processes, workﬂows and user inter-
faces.
– a pattern based approach for interface design. Familiar patterns increase consistency,
improve the user experience and ease the application design.
– a standardized object access including lifecycle services and services like search,
classify, etc. From a programming point of view this provides a high level of produc-
tivity.
As a summary, at design time xApps developers can use the existing NetWeaver tools,
such as UI modeler, process and workﬂow modeler, business object modeler, service
modeler, while at run time they can take advantage of the NetWeaver features and
services such as knowledge management or business process management. 
Assessment
With its NetWeaver platform, SAP has chosen a course of action that will take the open
nature of SOA into account while ensuring the long-term uniform implementation of
this architecture in all SAP applications. 
SAP is on its way to become completely independent of middleware from other manu-
facturers (e.g. BEA WebLogic, IBM WebSphere), with its NetWeaver technology plat-
form. This independence on the one hand ties up development resources, since SAP
will have to develop competitive middleware components itself. On the other hand, all
SAP solutions will only be based on one platform in the future, no matter whether it
will be J2EE or ABAP; this will save development and test resources and be strategi-
cally of importance. 
In an upcoming modularized application world based on SOA and web services SAP
can even be expected to market its NetWeaver technology platform as an open platform
independently of SAP applications. Deploying NetWeaver’s platform services, such as
the application, portal and XI server, enables enterprises to integrate whatever offered
web services to support their business processes as ﬂexibly as possible.
SOA undoubtedly will set in motion the market for innovative solutions and services
and offer new opportunities to niche players with very specialized or innovative ser-
vices. This means increasing competition for SAP in terms of solutions, but on the
other hand gives SAP the opportunity to offer its own web services as standard network
services that can be used regardless of the platform deployed. SAP should be in a good
position to do this, considering its existing application and process expertises.
5.4.2 Other vendor’s platforms
Technologies and architectures such as XML, web services, SOA and BPM have
changed signiﬁcantly application platforms of all major software vendors in the past
years. Besides SAP particularly Microsoft and IBM offer comprehensive middleware
platforms suitable for forward-looking e-business solutions with properties and fea-
tures described in this chapter.

5.4 Forward-looking SOA based application platforms
117
In the following just a few highlights are mentioned.
Microsoft
As depicted previously Microsoft [5.4.2] has been one of the two outstanding promot-
ers (IBM is the other) of web services technology and standards from the beginning.
Therefore the .NET framework has incorporated XML and web services technology
from the design. Furthermore Microsoft has deﬁned service-oriented application archi-
tecture for .NET, which comprises:
– UI components
UI (User Interface) components form the interface to the end user. This can be a web
application or a Windows application. User interfaces are created using ASP.NET
WinForms and/or WebForms, with functions for server-side controls, plausibility
checks, rendering and data formatting.
– UI process components
In many cases, user interaction with the system follows a deﬁned process sequence.
As an example users ﬁrst enter their order information (product selection, quantity)
then deﬁne the payment method (bank details, account number) and ﬁnally provide
delivery information (required delivery date, shipping address). UI Process Compo-
nents can be used to synchronize and orchestrate these logically harmonized sub-
steps. Process ﬂow and state management are then no longer hardwired into the user
interface.
– Service interfaces
To make business logic available in the form of a service, a service interface is pro-
vided. The service interface describes issues such as format, protocol, security and
exception handling and can be used by a number of other service users. 
– Business workﬂows
Many business processes comprise a number of steps which have to be carried out in
the correct sequence. Business workﬂows deﬁne and coordinate long-running, multi-
step business processes and can be implemented using business process management
tools such as BizTalk Server Orchestration.
– Business components
Business components can be used to map business rules or to carry out speciﬁc busi-
ness-related tasks. Business components implement and represent the business logic
of the application.
– Business entities
In many applications, data must be transported from one layer to another. The data
represent real-world business entities, such as products or orders. The business enti-
ties used internally in the application generally employ data structures such as
ADO.NET DataSets, DataReaders or XML Streams.
– Data access components
In most applications, data sources (databases) must be accessed. For reasons of
improved scalability, conﬁgurability and ease of maintenance, data access functions
should always be implemented in a separate layer.

5 Web services
118
– Service agents
If a business component requires information from an external service, the commu-
nication interface must be supplied with data correctly. Service agents hide the often
rather complicated communication interface in an external service and can take over
data format mapping if the user’s application is using other data formats than the
external service.
Microsoft has consolidated its .NET Enterprise Servers under the brand name Windows
Server System 2003. The Application Infrastructure contains SQL Server, Content
Management Server, Commerce Server, BizTalk Server and Host Integration Server.
The Information Worker Infrastructure comprises Project Server, Exchange Server and
SharePoint Portal Server. The IT Infrastructure contains: Internet Security & Accelera-
tion Server, Systems Management Server, Application Center and Operations Manager.
An example of the seamless integration of systems and services, being disjointed until
now, is the access to Amazon.com from Microsoft Ofﬁce System. While working with
Ofﬁce, users can get access to Amazon’s products directly without opening a web
browser. The integration is achieved through Amazon’s web services so that users can
access Amazon from the Research Task Pane, available in the Microsoft Ofﬁce 2003
Edition. Users will be able to access information at Amazon and buy items without
launching a browser or closing the Ofﬁce document, e-mail message or presentation
application they are using at the same time. The applications will also allow users to
add footnotes, bibliography entries or book cover art from Amazon into Microsoft doc-
uments without having to do so manually.
The Research Task Pane uses XML to allow retrieval and navigation of web-based
information from within Ofﬁce programs. It is a feature of the desktop applications
Word and Excel; Outlook messaging and collaboration software; PowerPoint; Access;
OneNote, which enables note taking; and Publisher and Visio drawing and diagram-
ming software.
IBM
IBM is today the market leader for J2EE application server with its WebSphere product
family. As a pure middleware vendor IBM focuses on mission-critical middleware such
as portal server, application server, integration server including BPM, on interoperabil-
ity with other platforms based on standards, as well as on cross-company business
transactions including security aspects and cross-company business processes. IBM’s
focus on technology and standardization has been web services and business integra-
tion for the recent years.
The WebSphere application server provides the J2EE technology-based platform inte-
grated with tools that support web services standards, such as SOAP, UDDI, and
WSDL [5.4.3]. The incorporation of web services enables to build WebSphere software
applications that dynamically interact with web services using SOAP, UDDI, WSDL,
and XML. Web services made available by other vendors can also be incorporated. Fur-
thermore the WebSphere Application Server administrator manages the security and

5.5 Summary and recommendations
119
lifecycle attributes of these services. WebSphere as well enables the transformation of
existing applications into web services.
 As the WebSphere family comprises portal, application and integration server it consti-
tutes a rich application platform based on SOA and web services technology, including
BPM. IBM WebSphere Application Server is a high-performance and scalable transac-
tion engine for dynamic e-business applications. The Open Services Infrastructure
allows companies to deploy a core operating environment that works as a reliable foun-
dation capable of handling high volumes of secure transactions and web services. 
5.5 Summary and recommendations
For the ﬁrst time in IT history, a new architecture (SOA) is being jointly promoted by
different technology proponents (Microsoft on the one hand, Sun/IBM on the other) as
well as by application vendors (SAP, Siebel, etc.). It is worth noting that the market
leaders (IBM, Microsoft, and SAP) are obviously closing ranks very tightly. IBM,
Microsoft and SAP are expected to deliver the interoperability services they have
announced, both in their own interests and in the context of their customer require-
ments. This will strengthen the positions of the three market leaders and create a new
triumvirate of power that will place other competitors in a difﬁcult situation.
However enterprises’ focus will shift from the platform and middleware to business
process integration and to industry-speciﬁc applications. In these areas more competi-
tion in general and particularly between SAP, IBM and Microsoft can be expected for
the next years.
Web services will become mainstream for application deployment and particularly for
business process integration. Therefore it is important that enterprises move to under-
stand this technology. Application integration today often managed by point-to-point
‘spaghetti’ connections will successively be replaced by integration technologies
deploying web services.
Enterprises should immediately begin strategic planning for future service-oriented
architectures on the foundation of web services including every area of the enterprise
infrastructure. Strategic planning will enable them to determine web services classes
that are most appropriate for their needs. It is important to point out, that enterprises
must make security an integral part of the web services strategy and planning efforts. 
In addition enterprises should increase education and development efforts to get famil-
iar with web services standards and technologies and improve their expertise.
For ﬁrst implementations ‘keep it simple’ will be the best strategy. Companies are rec-
ommended to approach this new technology conservatively by maintaining indepen-
dence from mission-critical applications. 
According to recently published analysis of Meta Group three deployment phases of
web services in business solutions are ongoing and expected:

5 Web services
120
Phase 1 (2003/2004)
Enterprises evaluate the advantages/disadvantages of web services and SOA and
assess their existing EAI products and infrastructure. They deploy web services in
internal integration projects and implement some non-critical applications based on
web services. They start to develop roadmaps and projects to transform existing archi-
tecture into SOA.
Phase 2 (2005/2006)
IT budgets will grow again. The majority of enterprises will deploy web services. Web
services will not only be applied to basic and static services but will increasingly create
a dynamic environment. External partners will be involved and cross-enterprise pro-
cesses will be supported by web services technology.
Phase 3 (2007/2008)
The paradigm software as services will become reality. Web services are capable of
composing dynamically adjusted, running applications used by business partners and
customers mainly without human intervention. SOA and integrated infrastructure are
becoming norm within large enterprises. Late followers will adapt web services, too.
Considering Professional IT Service Provider 
It may be assumed that SOA and the web services technology will enforce the out-
sourcing trend. Moreover the combined capabilities of business process design, busi-
ness integration and outsourcing might turn out as a key success factor of modern busi-
ness solutions. Therefore enterprises are recommended to consider taking advantage of
professional services of competent IT and outsourcing service providers.
Enterprises should prefer such service providers, which in general have the technolog-
ical SOA/web services expertise (development, deployment) but in particular also have
extensive experiences in the strategic competence areas: process design, business inte-
gration, and web services management (infrastructure, applications, monitoring, met-
rics, security, certiﬁcation, contracts, SLAs, etc.). Service providers’ platform neutral-
ity and interoperability expertises should be of advantage. In addition the service pro-
vider should be able to offer demanded outsourcing services.

2005 some 80 percent of all companies will be using the Internet either wired or wire-
less as an integral part of their business processes. Consequently, many companies will
be confronted with the problems of information security that are inexorably linked with
the use of the Internet.
As shown in ﬁgure 6.1 hackers and system administrators alike were busier than ever in
2003, a year that brought a 68% increase in computer security incidents and vulnerabil-
ities, according to statistics published in February 2004. According to the Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT), the computer security clearinghouse at Pitts-
burgh’s Carnegie Mellon University, 137529 incidents, including web site attacks,
malicious viruses and network intrusions, were reported in 2003. The numbers are up
from 82094 the previous year, CERT indicates. To put the ﬁgures into perspective, inci-
dents reported 2003 accounted for 42% of all attacks reported since 1988, the ﬁrst year
CERT began keeping records [6.1].
There is still a lack of information on how seriously security incidents actually affect
business in the short-term and long-term. The estimation of the worldwide economic
loss caused by viruses only is in the magnitude of billions of dollars.
It goes without saying that enterprises and credit card organizations and ﬁnancial ser-
vice providers in particular have no interest in publishing their real losses caused by
security incidents. They certainly would not like to risk their reputations. Experts agree
that most security breaches go unreported.

6.1 Dangers and vulnerabilities
Cross-company business processes frequently involve enabling access to enterprise
networks and resources for customers, business partners and suppliers. Information
values that were kept carefully under lock with traditional business solutions are now
made accessible. 
As depicted in ﬁgure 6.2 this obviously involves security risks, since a wide-reaching
and open network has a number of potential attack points. The challenges involved
with wireless Internet access and the increasing integration of mobile employees, busi-
ness partners and customers have led to a situation in which deﬁciencies and security
vulnerabilities are rising exponentially. In the world of the service-oriented achitecture
and web services technology, characterized by cross-enterprise transactions and inde-
pendent web service providers, a new dimension of business risks will arise and
extended high level security measures will become indispensable.
The more corporate B2C, B2B and B2E business processes rely on open networks, the
greater the chance that someone with malicious intent will hack in and damage the sys-
tems that run the business. Furthermore, there is no such thing as a typical corporate
enemy. 
Disgruntled employees and hackers are the most likely sources of attacks, but compet-
itors and even foreign governments may try to breach systems and steal or manipulate
crucial information. Espionage of business and technology assets and secrets is the
most underestimated threat in the world today.
Most common attacks
Some of the most common attacks are shown in the following representation.
Figure 6.2 Dangers and vulnerabilities in e-business scenarios

6.1 Dangers and vulnerabilities
123
Viruses
are the most common form of security breach. A virus is a program or piece of code
that is loaded onto an organization’s computers without its knowledge and that runs
against its wishes. Viruses attach themselves to programs or ﬁles. Most are self-repli-
cating, quickly using up all available computer memory, and many of them can trans-
mit themselves across networks. 
Packet sniffers
A packet sniffer is a software application that uses a network adapter card to capture all
packets that are sent across the network. Sniffers are used legitimately in networks
today to aid in troubleshooting and trafﬁc analysis. Because several network applica-
tions send data in clear text (telnet, FTP, SMTP, POP3, etc.), a packet sniffer can also
provide sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
IP spooﬁng
An IP spooﬁng attack occurs when a hacker pretends to be a trusted computer. A hacker
can do this in one of two ways: the hacker either uses an IP address that is within the
range of trusted IP addresses for a network or an authorized external IP address that is
trusted and has access to speciﬁed resources on a network. IP spooﬁng attacks are often
a launch point for other attacks. The classic scenario is launching a denial-of-service
(DoS) attack using spoofed source addresses to hide the hacker’s identity.
Password attacks
Hackers can launch password attacks using several different methods, including brute-
force attacks, Trojan horse programs, IP spooﬁng, and packet sniffers. Although packet
sniffers and IP spooﬁng can yield user accounts and passwords, password attacks usu-
ally refer to repeated attempts to identify a user account and/or password. These
repeated attempts are called brute-force attacks.
A brute-force attack is often launched using a program that runs across the network and
attempts to log in to a shared resource, such as a server. When hackers successfully
gain access to resources they have the same rights as the users whose accounts have
been compromised. If the compromised accounts have sufﬁcient privileges, the hackers
can create back doors for future access without needing to worry about any status or
password changes to the compromised user accounts.
Denial-of-services 
In a Denial-of-Services (DoS) attack, a hacker gains access to several computers con-
nected to the Internet and installs code on these systems. At the hacker’s signal, the sys-
tems start to send data to targeted web sites. The sudden burst of network trafﬁc over-
loads the web servers and the networks they are connected to, slowing performance and
eventually crashing the site.

6 Security focus areas
124
Man-in-the-middle attacks
A man-in-the-middle attack requires that the hacker has access to network packets that
come across a network. An example of such a conﬁguration could be someone who is
working for an ISP (Interner Service Provider), who has access to all network packets
transferred between his employer’s network and any other network. Such attacks are
often implemented using network packet sniffers and routing and transport protocols.
The possible applications of such attacks are theft of information, hijacking of an ongo-
ing session to gain access to private network resources, analysis of trafﬁc to obtain
information about a network and its users, denial of service, corruption of transmitted
data, and introduction of new information into network sessions.
Physical break-ins
In this attack intruders actually gain access to a data center or steal equipment. Data
center security must go beyond a simple lock and key. Data centers may represent the
most valuable assets of a company. Stolen laptops and PDAs are a common and costly
problem, not only because they are expensive to replace but also because of the propri-
etary information that may be stored on them.
6.2 Security embedded in e-business solutions
Security and the according methods, measures, techniques and components cannot
clearly be distinguished from well deﬁned hardware and software components that are
deployed in e-business solutions. Whether considering hardware, software or networks,
security is a ubiquitous embedded piece of hardware or software of any mainframes,
servers, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, routers, switches, access components, oper-
ating systems, middleware, standard applications, vertical applications, web services
and business processes. Nonetheless this does not imply that there are in addition some
discrete security components such as crypto-boxes or ﬁrewalls which have been
designed for special purposes as security-appliances.
It is important to point out, that every of the above mentioned components needs to be
equiped with proper security features in order to achieve end-to-end security, which is
the ultimate requirement for reliable e-business solutions. 
6.2.1 The house of e-business security
Enterprises are recommended to build a kind of house of e-business security as a pre-
requisite to achieve end-to-end security with their business processes. Figure 6.3 shows
the construction of that house. The policy as the foundation deﬁnes how to use the busi-
ness assets and trust as the roof of the house, which creates and establishes the conﬁ-
dence among all partners. In the middle of the house are the goals, which are intended
to reach. Various security techniques are used to build that house, but ﬁgure 6.3 shows
rather the essential techniques than a comprehensive security world.

6.2 Security embedded in e-business solutions
125
Security goals
Security in e-business solutions has many different facets, but the main goal is protect-
ing the conﬁdentiality and privacy, integrity, and availability of the information an
organization owns or has custody over. A violation of any of these components can
quickly put an organization at risk, from a liability perspective as well as in terms of its
reputation. In addition non-repudiation is an essential property in the context of e-busi-
ness transactional applications.
The above qualities are deﬁned as follows:
Conﬁdentiality and privacy 
means the prevention of disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized recipients.
Conﬁdential information will be kept secret, with access limited to appropriate per-
sons. Conﬁdentiality reduces or eliminates the risk of ﬁnancial loss, public embarrass-
ment, or legal liability from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive, critical or personal
information.
Integrity 
means the completeness and soundness of information. Information will not be acci-
dentally or maliciously altered or destroyed. Integrity ensures that information is
authentic and changed only in a speciﬁed and authorized manner and by an authorized
individual. It reduces or eliminates the risk to the business that critical information can
be accidentally or intentionally manipulated.
Availability
refers to the accessibility of systems and information to authorized users. Information
and communication services will be ready for use when expected. Availability ensures
that systems operate promptly and services are not denied. When systems are available
Figure 6.3 The house of e-business security

6 Security focus areas
126
close to 100% of the time, missed opportunities or interruption of operations due to the
inaccessibility of information are signiﬁcantly reduced.
Non-repudiation
means that business partners can trust each other and that business transactions are ver-
iﬁable. This is a method by which the sender of data is provided with proof of delivery
and the recipient is assured of the sender’s identity, so that neither can later deny having
processed the data.
The importance of policy and trust
Security policy
The security policy is the foundation for secure e-business and m-business transactions.
Effective security begins with the articulation of the policies for access to enterprise
assets. This articulation deﬁnes the proper business use of all asset types (data, applica-
tions, etc.) by different categories of enterprise users (sales force, engineers, control-
lers, marketers, etc.). 
Enterprise access policies are even more important in mobile business because of the
sheer scale of the challenges. Mobile devices obviously increase the number of devices
per user. This means that the number of discrete assets and users to be managed
increases exponentially and also that threats to the enterprise increase accordingly.
Comprehensive policy deﬁnition and management recognize that employees will have
multiple devices and may use multiple network service providers for access to corpo-
rate data.
Trust
In today’s uncertain economic climate trust is the one thing above all that is needed for
business to compete successfully. Conﬁdence is a great enabler, letting exploit new
opportunities with e-business – reaching more customers, working more closely with
suppliers, empowering employees and driving new revenue streams. But conﬁdence
only comes when every participant is convinced that every business related interaction
is handled totally secure.
Most common security techniques
Security techniques comprise a wide ﬁeld of technologies. The Computer Security
Handbook [6.2.1] is recommended for readers who want to experience a comprehen-
sive view of security techniques, basic technologies as well as a wide ﬁeld of security
related issues. 
Over the last decade an evolutionary process has brought out some mature security
techniques which are suited to achieve the aforementioned security goals. Among these
techniques, the following are the most commonly used with today’s business solutions.

6.2 Security embedded in e-business solutions
127
Authentication
provides a means for identifying an object – a user, a system, an application and so on.
After being authenticated, the object can be granted access to the services it requires,
and its activities can be monitored. Authentication mechanisms range from the familiar
username and password to authentication certiﬁcates to sophisticated biometrics sys-
tems which authenticate users through physical characteristics such as ﬁngerprints.
Authentication is a foundation of any security implementation, and is often a key part
of other security solutions.
Anti-virus software
There are several types of anti-virus software – from solutions that protect individual
user devices to those that protect ﬁle and messaging servers – and all are necessary in
the ﬁght against viruses. An effective anti-virus strategy also includes regular software
updates to protect against the latest threats, as well as ongoing education to ensure that
users are aware of the dangers and how to avoid them. Most important, the anti-virus
strategy must specify standards for desktop conﬁgurations and usage. Restricting
which software employees are permitted to load on their devices can help prevent
viruses from being introduced and can solve breaches more quickly if they occur.
Virtual private networks 
Virtual Private Nerworks (VPN) allow remote employees to access the corporate net-
work using the Internet as the transmission medium. Encryption technology and secure
tunneling protocols make the network private, even though communication takes place
over public phone lines or radio networks. In effect, the VPN makes possible the secure
exchange of information across a public network which is indispensable when deploy-
ing mobile devices in radio networks. 
Firewalls
A ﬁrewall examines data as it enters the corporate network and blocks trafﬁc that does
not meet speciﬁed criteria. There are several types of ﬁrewalls, and all can be used in
combination. A proxy server intercepts all messages entering and leaving the corporate
network and hides the true network address. A packet ﬁlter examines data packets
entering or leaving the corporate network and accepts or rejects them on the basis of
speciﬁed criteria. An application gateway secures speciﬁc applications. A circuit-level
gateway applies security mechanisms when a connection is established; after that, net-
work trafﬁc ﬂows without further checking.
Intrusion detection systems 
Applications that actively monitor operating systems and network trafﬁc for attacks
and breaches are called Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The goal of IDS is to pro-
vide a near-real-time view of what is happening on the corporate network. There are
two approaches to intrusion detection: network-based and host-based. Network-based

6 Security focus areas
128
systems sniff the wire, comparing live trafﬁc patterns to a list of known attacks. Host-
based systems use software agents that are installed on all servers and report activity to
a central console. A complete solution involves both types. Both require a regularly
updated list of known attacks, just like anti-virus software.
Transport encryption
Transport encryption is implemented in standard transport protocols such as the Trans-
port Layer Security (TLS) and the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols used for com-
munication via Internet as well as for the Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS)
protocol designed for WAP applications in wireless networks. These protocols allow
the transmission of messages preventing eavesdropping, tampering or message forgery.
The protocol takes the messages to be transmitted, fragments the data into manageable
blocks, optionally compresses the data, applies a hashed message authentication code
and then encrypts and transmits the result. The received data is decrypted, veriﬁed,
decompressed, reassembled and then delivered to higher level protocols.
Data encryption
Data encryption is applied to protect any content (text, data, graphic, voice, video)
stored on any device, server or other storage medium and to assure that only authorized
people who possess the secret (key) needed for decryption can access and manipulate
the content.
Single sign-on 
The purpose of Single Sign-On (SSO) is that a user can securely access all those – and
only those – resources for which he or she is authorized as determined by the security
policies, with a single logon regardless of what systems, applications and resources he
or she is accessing during a session or a predeﬁned timeframe.
Certiﬁcates/digital signature
A trustworthy institution, i.e. a Trust Center (TC) or a Certiﬁcation Authority (CA) car-
ries out the assignment of the pair of keys to a particular person, generates the appropri-
ate certiﬁcates and distributes them (see public key infrastructure).
Digital certiﬁcates are used to generate digital signatures and digital signatures are
applied to guarantee data/content integrity. Digital signatures are electronic signatures
linked to the signed data in such a way that tampering does not pass unnoticed and the
sender can be unequivocally identiﬁed. Digital signatures are also used for user authen-
tication. Other forms of electronic signatures, such as PINs, do not protect data integ-
rity. In order to create a digital signature, the signing person uses a private key exclu-
sively owned by him or herself. The private key has a matching public key that can be
used to verify the signature. 

6.2 Security embedded in e-business solutions
129
Public key infrastructure 
The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is an infrastructure used for both authentication
and encryption. It combines software, encryption technologies and services to protect
network communications and e-business transactions. PKI involves a system of digital
certiﬁcates – an attachment to an electronic message that can encrypt data and verify
that the sender is who he or she claims to be – as well as certiﬁcate authorities, a third
party that issues the digital certiﬁcate. PKI protects information assets by authenticat-
ing identity using a digital certiﬁcate, verifying integrity by ensuring that messages
have not been altered or data corrupted and ensuring privacy by protecting information
from interception during transit. 
Smartcards
Secrets like private keys are best stored in tamper-resistant moduls. Smartcards are
based on such tamper-resistant chip technology that implies hardware and software
protection measures and represents a very high security level. Smartcards or processor
based chipcards (ICC, Integrated Circuit Card) have been standardized for more than
10 years (ISO 7816). In general the smartcard is a multifunctional tool which makes
the smartcard an ideal tool for realizing applications like employee or citizen identity
cards that comprise a multitude of applications like admission control for buildings and
rooms, cashless staff restaurant payment, user authentication for applications and net-
works and digital signatures as proof of origin for electronic documents.
6.2.2 The holistic security solution
Most existing information security concepts are primarily tailored to the aspect of IT
security. However, technical security solutions are no longer sufﬁcient on their own to
deal with future requirements. Technical, personal and operational security measures
must be combined in order to implement a truly comprehensive information security
policy. This means that all the different perspectives of information security in a com-
pany must be taken into account.
Enterprise view
The enterprise view is the perspective of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO). This per-
spective involves the company as a whole and deals with obligations to employees,
shareholders and the public, as well as responsibility for legal compliance. Information
security must comply with the higher-level and strategic objectives of the company.
One of the important tasks of the CEO includes deﬁning master agreements for dealing
with disasters (disaster recovery and business continuity).
Business process owner view
Business process managers are responsible for the efﬁcient and smooth operation of
their business processes. To do this, they must recognize the information security risks
that could endanger the execution of their business processes. They have to initiate suit-
able technical, organizational and personal measures to limit these risks.

6 Security focus areas
130
IT view
The role of the Chief Information Ofﬁcer (CIO) involves providing IT infrastructures
and the associated security measures and services for supporting the business processes
and corporate goals of the enterprise. The provision of these infrastructures and ser-
vices must comply with proﬁtability principles. An efﬁcient solution can be best
achieved by avoiding speciﬁc isolated solutions. Suitable security architectures and
services are needed and a standard security portfolio must be deﬁned. This portfolio
must be heavily derived from the company’s strategy and the company’s business pro-
cesses in order to comply with present and future information and communication vari-
ants.
Information security management system
A holistic approach for information security takes all these different views into account
and consists of the following components that can be combined to form a suitable
project approach. The objective of an information security management system is to
establish corporate assurance on information security and transparency on its current
status for senior management.
An Information Security Management System (ISMS) consists of a documentation set
deﬁning and supporting the business and various information security procedures and
processes in different categories (e.g. access control, personal security) which provide
guidance to staff and information to senior management on the ongoing effectiveness
of the ISMS. To be effective the ISMS must have a manageable size and its boundaries
should be clearly deﬁned. Large corporations invariably need to establish many sepa-
rate ISMSs, each under local management control and direction that are then aggre-
gated on higher levels. 
The process of operating a management system with a security focus is very similar to
operating a management system with, for example, a quality assurance or environmen-
tal focus. Many organizations have an active quality management system which is reg-
ularly audited against standards such as ISO 9001. ISO 17799 has enabled this princi-
ple to be extended to information security. It is not necessary to achieve formal certiﬁ-
cation to beneﬁt greatly from implementing the ISMS within an organization. How-
ever, unless the implementation of the ISMS is approached in a methodical manner, so
that formal certiﬁcation could be feasible at a later date, the full business beneﬁts are
unlikely to be realized.
An information security management system is implemented by identifying the current
gaps according to the categories given by the ISO 17799 and deﬁning appropriate
actions to achieve the described objectives. A corporate policy that gives direction on
the objectives of information security within the company is issued and appropriate
bodies are installed (with participation of senior management) to support the ISMS
objectives throughout the enterprise.
A holistic security concept considers the different perspectives mentioned above and
comprises a portfolio of standardized security architectures, components, services and

6.2 Security embedded in e-business solutions
131
policies. Based on these concepts, reliable business processes can be implemented
along the consult, design, build, operate and manage value-added chain.
Figure 6.4 shows the comprehensive enterprise views, the corresponding, embedded
security of the I&C-infrastructure, the business processes and the enterprises executive
level as well as the successive steps to accomplish a holistic security solution.
Holistic security solutions should be based on a standard security portfolio and imple-
mented in a business oriented way considering both business scenarios and threat sce-
narios.
There are various business scenarios of relevance to the present situation such as mobi-
lizing employees, evolving new customer channels, integrating supply chain partners,
establishing new ofﬁces, incorporate web services and many others.
Threat scenarios consider all types of dangers such as sabotage, espionage, oversight,
impairment which could damage enterprise assets, employees or business processes.
Security solutions should be evaluated systematically walking through step by step
along the total value chain (consult, design, build, operate and maintain) to establish
solutions to safeguard the future.
Typically this may include the following steps and key questions:
– Risk analysis of business processes: What are the values of the business process to be
protected? What risks must be guarded against? What are the priorities? What are the
principles to follow?
– Security policy for business processes: How should people handle security? Who is
responsible for what? What are the auditing, reporting and monitoring measures?
Figure 6.4 The holostic security solution

6 Security focus areas
132
– Security analysis of the existing I&C infrastructure and applications: What is the
current security status? What are the weaknesses and threats for which meaningful
measures are required? What supplementary measures are needed as a result of the
previous evaluations? 
– Transfer plan and security roadmap: How does the security strategy inﬂuence the
transfer plan? What elements should the future security portfolio consist of? How
should the appropriate security architecture look like? Which security techniques are
preferable? What are the priorities for different scenarios? What beneﬁts and costs
can be expected for the individual measures? How should the measures be paid for?
Who can implement the measures and when? What are the impacts on the business
processes?
– Risk management strategy: What is the procedure for damages not guarded against?
How can unforeseeable incidents be handled? What is the escalation procedure?
– Implementation: What is the development process and should it be integrated in the
application development process? How far are migration and integration evolved in
the ongoing operation?
– Operation, monitoring, reviews, audits, and certiﬁcations: How can be assured that
the security level is documented accurately and maintained once it has been
achieved? How can be assured that proactive and appropriate security requirements
will be considered for new scenarios or changing business processes? 
The security policy, security roadmap and the risk management are the cornerstones of
this process where the top management needs to be involved and where it should
clearly deﬁne its strategy and prevailing conditions. This will aid in a consistent enter-
prise-wide understanding which is the basis for deriving appropriate targets and score-
cards.
Risk management 
Business processes are increasingly dependent on information technology. This trend
means that an IT failure can result in high losses or even dramatic consequences for a
company.
In the aftermath of September 11th 2001, direct insurers and reinsurers realized that the
corporate reliance on international networks opened the way for claims running into
the billions. Reinsurers therefore canceled contracts involving insurance against loss of
production due to IT crashes. Responsibility for this insurance risk was then shifted to
the direct insurers, many of whom likewise considered the stakes to be too high and
therefore also canceled their contracts. 
The consequences of this development mean that enterprises now carry more responsi-
bility for taking their own precautionary measures and security must be considered in a
new light. The IT infrastructure is an essential criterion for the stability and availability
of most business processes. Yet increased availability also entails higher IT investment
and operation costs. As depicted in ﬁgure 6.5, the aim is to achieve cost effective pro-
tection, i.e. to ﬁnd the right balance between under and over protection.

6.2 Security embedded in e-business solutions
133
In this context desaster recovery and business continuity planning is an essential task
for enterprises, which have recognized the importance of risk management.
In general business continuity planning is a three step process:
– Conduct an analysis that deﬁnes critical processes, identiﬁes and prioritizes risks to
those processes and establishes policies to avoid or mitigate those risks.
– Devise a disaster recovery plan for critical systems and resources. This includes
establishing recovery teams, setting up notiﬁcation procedures, determining meeting
sites, tracking inventories of hardware and software, having readily accessible con-
tact information on vendors, and clearly deﬁned back up and recovery techniques.
– Set up intervals of training and testing for the disaster recovery team and the busi-
ness continuity plan as a way to make revisions and stay conﬁdent the plan is battle
tested.
Disaster recovery planning is a complex task. However it is important to keep the plan
simple and manageable for those that carry it out in cases of emergency. 
Dependent on the security strategy and risk assessments, enterprises must ﬁnd out the
optimal cost/risk point, i.e. how much investment in security measures is reasonable
and how to manage the remaining risks. Whereby risk means the evaluation and the
weighing up of possible threats and vulnerabilities, to which corporate assets are
exposed to.
The diagram in ﬁgure 6.6 shows a systematic approach how enterprises can handle and
manage risks. 
It makes sense to distinguish identiﬁed and accepted risks and to assume that there are
some risks still not identiﬁed. Even if making provisions by appropriate precautions
(e.g. reserves), enterprises must be aware that there are the remaining risks: accepted
and not identiﬁed risks. On the other hand very risky business activities should rather
Figure 6.5 The optimal cost/risk point

6 Security focus areas
134
be avoided in order to prevent that a company will be threatened in its core business.
Very often the major share of the identiﬁed risks can be protected by adequate security
measures, which include organizational, personal and technical aspects. And ﬁnally
some of the risks may be recognized to be best covered or managed by insurances or
external companies, such as service providers, which offer managed security services
or take over the outsourcing of whole business processes.
Managed security services
As end-to-end-security with e-business processes is a very complex issue but nonethe-
less more or less indispensible, the trend to take advantage of Managed Security Ser-
vices has become apparent in recent years. Obviously service providers with special
security expertise can do a more competent and reliable security job than enterprises,
which core business is e.g. manufacturing or trading. 
Experienced security service providers, which offer Managed Security Services, can
often avoid signiﬁcant damages by proactively preventing escalating security incidents
and thereby save enterprises a lot of money and reputation.
The Slammer Worm is a perfect example. It caused an Internet breach that should have
been prevented, because the vulnerability was announced more than six months ago.
In the early morning hours (USA) of January 25th, 2003, network administrators ﬁrst
detected the Slammer Worm. Within minutes, the worm had propagated itself around
the world, doubling the number of infected hosts every 8.5 seconds. Within ten minutes
of its outbreak, Slammer had infected more than 90 percent of vulnerable hosts. Slam-
mer exploited a six-months-old vulnerability in the Microsoft SQL Server, affecting
Windows NT, 2000, and XP systems running unpatched Microsoft SQL Server 2000
and Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE) 2000 applications.
Figure 6.6 The management of risks

6.2 Security embedded in e-business solutions
135
The Slammer Worm slowed the Internet to a crawl by generating massive levels of net-
work trafﬁc as it scanned IP addresses. The result was approximately $1 billion in dam-
age due to extensive web and ﬁnancial network troubles, including ATM networks and
credit card validation systems. 
By taking advantage of Managed Security Services enterprises in such cases can avoid
a lot of hassle.
Offered by a competent service provider Managed Security Services may provide for
protecting critical assets dedicated expertises, such as:
– Joint preparation of information security (IS) policies, IS management requirements
and IS roadmap, all tailored to the enterprises requirements
– Remotely managed and monitored ﬁrewall and VPN solutions to help detect and
respond to malicious hacker attacks. Experts may help to establish and maintain ade-
quate conﬁgurations to ensure the availability, integrity, and conﬁdentiality of net-
works and data.
– Real-time security monitoring and expert analysis of alerts. Management may
include remote conﬁguration, signature updates system, software support and sys-
tem upgrades.
– Evaluation and scanning of Internet-exposed systems such as ﬁrewalls, web servers,
and mail servers to detect viruses, unauthorized access and to prevent tampering or
theft.
– Assessment of security conﬁgurations against stated policies, helping to eliminate
exploitable vulnerabilities that pose a threat to e-business initiatives.
Example: security portfolio of a security service provider
Coming back to the proposed holistic security solution, enterprises should walk
through step by step along the total value chain (consult, design, build, operate and
maintain) to establish end-to-end security solutions. 
Hereby enterprises should consider carefully their different acting options. The ﬁrst
option may consist in providing the total security services by an own organisation,
which is fully responsible. Another option could take advantage of Managed Security
Services, i.e. the outtasking or outsourcing of deﬁned security services with service
level agreements. The next option is the business process outsourcing, which means
that a service provider takes over the full responsibility for e.g. human resource pro-
cesses or other support processes including end-to-end security. In this case an enter-
prise can better focus on its core business processes. A further option ﬁnally is the stra-
tegic outsourcing, which means that the service provider takes over the total I&C activ-
ities including any assets, contracts and employees. Furthermore any combinations of
these options are conceivable. 
Corresponding to these options various security service providers offer their different
services to the market. The ones primarily offer security products and related services
such as e.g. Entrust or Symantec, the others provide business process solutions with
embedded security and related services such as e.g. IBM Global Services or Siemens
Business Services.

The latter persues the idea of a holistic security solution and offers services along the
total value chain, consult, design, build, operate and maintain. As an example the secu-
rity portfolio of Siemens Business Services [6.2.2] is shown in ﬁgure 6.7.
This portfolio addresses the three levels of different responsibility of enterprises: IT
responsibility (CIO), Business Unit responsibility and Executive responsibility.
The CIO level portfolio comprises the I&C security architectures, services, policies
and products spanning from back up systems via smartcards, VPNs, digital signatures,
PKI, intrusion detection, single sign-on, etc. to the surveillance of buildings and
ﬁre/gas detection. Security technology and product partners of Siemens Business Ser-
vices cooperate with these security offerings.
The portfolio for the Business Unit level takes into account the various business sce-
narios as well as the speciﬁc communication, access, device, processing, environmen-
tal, etc. needs and provides enterprises with methods and services for risk analysis and
management.
Finally the offerings for the Executive level include the development of a security strat-
egy that is aligned with the strategy of the company as a whole and deals with obliga-
tions to employees, shareholders and the public, as well as with the responsibility for
legal compliance. Furthermore it includes the deﬁnition of master security processes
and organizational responsibilities.
An example of a security services provider with an interdisciplinary portfolio is the
Institute for Secure Telecooperation (SIT[6.2.2]) of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in Ger-

many. SIT combines its own competence of IT and telecommunication technologies
with the social, economical, organizational and jurisprudential competence of partners
from research, industry and government to produce solutions which are legally and
socially compatible, and thus widely acceptable.
6.2.3 Relevant focus areas
As carried out in the previous section e-business security is an issue with various facets
and many subjects of importance that companies need to understand and to make deci-
sions about. Examples such as the implementation of a PKI or a cross-enterprise iden-
tity management including customers, partners and employees may illustrate the wide
scope. The three security topics depicted in ﬁgure 6.8 belong to the focus areas of most
enterprises today.
Mobile security
Although wireless Internet applications are taking off more gradually than early mar-
keting might have forecast, the trend towards more ubiquitous access to corporate data
via the Internet will grow as wireless device technologies, bandwidth, and particularly
security improve. However, wireless access raises security challenges beyond those
normally encountered with wireline business on the Internet.
The individual security and reliability of any single piece of equipment, subsystem or
process remain mandatory. What matters ultimately is end-to-end trust, reliability and
conﬁdentiality of the transaction that employees, customers, partners or suppliers have
access to. The requirement for end-to-end security measures and integrated risk assess-
Figure 6.8 Security focus areas

6 Security focus areas
138
ment is therefore obvious. The complexity and interdependence of e-business transac-
tions have become so critical that transactions must be managed and secured as a whole. 
Mobile business processes pose new challenges for enterprises. Securing data and
transactions from the wireless device, through the air, through carrier links, over the
Internet, and onto the protected server involves bringing together security issues at
multiple levels. Smartcards and SIM cards might be valuable components to meet such
challenges. Details are covered in section 6.3.
Single sign-on
IDC estimates that the number of Internet users worldwide will double between 2001
and 2006, increasing from 500 millions to 1 billion. However the reality shows that
there is a growing gap between business openness, the increasing needs of access that
companies face with their customers and partners, and the existing ﬁrewall IT-infra-
structure, which is not capable to manage these future security requirements. 
Customers, supply chain partners and employees need to communicate and share infor-
mation on an immediate basis no matter what time of the day and where in the world
ofﬁces or workers are located. But it is important that this has to be carried out in a con-
ﬁdent, secure and highly available manner.
For the various user groups with very different business-proﬁles authentication and
authorization must provide appropriate protection to resources in a cost-effective and
manageable manner. Web based single sign-on authentication systems reduce manage-
ment costs signiﬁcantly and moreover enhance the user’s experience by avoiding the
omnipresent passport hassle. 
The strength of authentication that is required depends on the risks associated with the
business process, service, application or system to which authenticated access is
requested as well as the costs of mitigating those risks.
Two classes of web based single sign-on platforms can be distinguished: Internet SSO-
services such as Microsoft Passport or the Liberty Alliance Project and enterprise SSO-
services, which are embedded in the enterprises’ application platforms.
The details are covered in section 6.4 
Web services security 
The beneﬁt of having a loosely-coupled, language-neutral, platform-independent way
of linking applications within organizations, across enterprises, and across the Internet
deploying web services are becoming more and more evident. However in the past,
security concerns were the main inhibitor of the widespread deployment of web ser-
vices. 
A framework of security standards for web services has been worked out recently, not
yet ﬁnished, but applicable products based on XML-security have been available on the
market in the meantime.

6.3 Mobile end-to-end security
139
Web services security provides a general-purpose mechanism for associating security
tokens with SOAP messages in order to guarantee reliable messages. 
Trust will play a central role with web services as associated partners may not know
each other. Trust covers the model for establishing both direct and brokered trust rela-
tionships including third parties. Trust policy and how to construct federated trust sce-
narios are the top challenges. Details are covered in section 6.5.
6.3 Mobile end-to-end security
Modern e-business architectures will migrate toward integrated e-business and mobile-
business architectures by supporting devices via both traditional wired and wireless
networks. For the foreseeable future, mainstream m-business enterprise solutions will
consist of integrating m-business into existing e-business architectures.
The front-end platform (web server/mobile access/portal server) supports both wire-
line and wireless devices as shown in ﬁgure 6.9. This platform can be described as a
uniﬁed platform as it enables wireline and wireless access and it hosts a portal which is
common to both wired and wireless channels of communications. The front-end plat-
form provides interfaces to back-end systems, application servers, databases and other
enterprise resources such as legacy systems and directory services. In addition, further
interfaces to external services such as a banking payment system may be implemented.
For example, the uniﬁed platform might connect a user to a banking payment system
regardless of whether he or she is sitting at the computer or using a smartphone to shop
on the go. 
Figure 6.9 E- and m-business security architecture

Front-end servers are usually located in the so-called Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with a
ﬁrewall to protect against unauthorized access through the open networks. Further ﬁre-
walls may protect back-end systems, the Intranet or special enterprise network seg-
ments depending on the chosen security topology. 
6.3.1 Network channels
Risks are inherent in any wireless technology. Some of these risks are similar to those
of wired networks, some are exacerbated by wireless connectivity. The obvious source
of risks in wireless networks is that the technology’s underlying communications
medium, the airwave, is somehow open to intruders.
The loss of conﬁdentiality and integrity and the threat of denial of service (DoS)
attacks are risks typically associated with wireless communications. Unauthorized
users may gain access to enterprise systems and resources, corrupt the data, consume
network bandwidth, degrade network performance or launch attacks that prevent
authorized users from accessing the network.
Typical threats and vulnerabilities to wireless networks include the following:
– Unauthorized access to an enterprise’s network through wireless connections,
bypassing any ﬁrewall protections
– Sensitive information that is not encrypted (or that is encrypted with poor crypto-
graphic techniques) and that is transmitted between two wireless devices may be
intercepted and disclosed
– DoS attacks directed at wireless connections or devices
– Steal of the identity of legitimate users and masquerade as them on internal or exter-
nal corporate networks
Figure 6.10 Secure network channels

6.3 Mobile end-to-end security
141
– Sensitive data being corrupted during improper synchronization
– Malicious entities violate the privacy of legitimate users and track their movements
– Misuse of third-party, untrusted wireless network services to gain access to enter-
prises’ network resources
– Internal attacks via ad hoc transmissions
Concerning the wireline and wireless transmission protocols ﬁve different network
channels to access a front-end can be distinguished as shown in ﬁgure 6.10. In any case
the enterprise dial-in is controlled by a Remote Access Server (RAS).
Wireline Access via SSL/TLS (Channel 1)
Security transport services for wireline devices such as PCs and laptops are provided
by the standard Internet protocol SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer
Security). HTTPS (HTTP secure) connections use this protocol regardless of the medi-
ating Internet service provider. However in order to guarantee a high level secure con-
nection during the dial-in procedure and for others than web applications, a VPN (usu-
ally based on the IPSEC standard) must be established between the client and the target
front-end. VPN includes client/server authentication and secure tunneling via encryp-
tion of the transmitted messages.
Access via GSM, GPRS, UMTS with WAP devices (Channel 2)
Global networks such as GSM, GPRS and UMTS operate with different standards, pro-
tocols and qualities of service and differ in their security characteristics.
GSM networks, for example, have embedded security architecture but use short voice
encryption keys (64-bit), a weak encryption algorithm, and do not support encryption
of SMS messages. Moreover there are no integrity checks and user authentication can-
not prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Therefore additional security measures are
required for a secure transmission over the air to the Internet.
WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) phones or mobile devices with a WAP browser
are switched to the front-end of an enterprise via the WAP gateway, usually located at
the network operator’s site. 
The client is connected by securing the transmission path from the client to the WAP
gateway via the wireless network as well as from the WAP gateway to the front-end via
the Internet.
WTLS (Wireless Transport Layer Security) is the standard security protocol for manag-
ing secure WAP connections via the wireless network (See later in this section for more
information). WTLS provides features such as data encryption, data integrity, and cli-
ent/server authentication.
The WAP standard [6.3.1] has deﬁned three security classes for mobile device commu-
nication with a WAP gateway:
– Class 1: Data encryption (WAP 1.1)
– Class 2: Server (gateway) authentication (WAP 1.1)

6 Security focus areas
142
– Class 3: Client (mobile device) authentication (WAP 1.2)
Appropriate features and services for the second transmission path are provided by the
standard Internet protocol SSL/TLS. 
Because WTLS has been optimized for use over narrow-band communication chan-
nels, it is not compatible with SSL/TLS, i.e. it provides different encryption algo-
rithms.
This incompatibility means that the data is exposed brieﬂy during the process of con-
verting the WTLS protocol into TLS/SSL and vice versa in the WAP gateway, thus
leaving open the possibility of a security breach, especially for staff physically operat-
ing the WAP gateway system. Even if both the wireless network and the Internet each
have high-performance security mechanisms, additional measures such as service level
agreements with a network operator are required for end-to-end security. 
Access via enterprise WAP gateway (Channel 3)
The security risks outlined above have prompted some enterprises (i.e. banks) to oper-
ate their own WAP gateway in a trusted environment which they can control them-
selves. In this case the network operator’s mobile switching center can switch the
device directly to the enterprise’s WAP gateway. Security services are also provided by
WTLS and SSL/TLS protocols.
Access via GSM, GPRS, UMTS with IP devices (Channel 4)
There is an increasing range of GSM/GPRS/UMTS-capable wireless IP devices with
HTML browsers (i.e. laptops, PDAs, smartphones). The WTLS protocol is usually not
applied to these devices. End-to-end security on the transport level is instead achieved
by the SSL/TLS protocol and/or a VPN.
Access via WLAN (Channel 5)
Mobile devices with a WLAN network access (802.11x, Wi-Fi) are connected to the
target front-end via the wireless access point (WLAN AP) located somewhere in a
hotspot area such as an airport or in a wireless area of an enterprise. These devices
partly obey the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) standard, an encryption mechanism
between the device and the access point. However the standard contains some major
security weaknesses to do with static keys, short key lengths, handling of larger conﬁg-
urations and changing of access points during user’s movements. That is why addi-
tional VPNs are essential for these network conﬁgurations. 
More recently shipped WLAN components apply the WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
standard [6.3.2], which has been deﬁned by an industry-consortium and address all
known weaknesses of WEP. WPA must be seen as an interim standard. It improves
security and includes some work which already has been done by the IEEE 802.11i
Task Group. It currently deﬁnes a standard called RSN (Robust Security Network)
intended for a (real) secure future WLAN. However components, that will apply
802.11i are expected to be available not before late 2004 or 2005.

6.3 Mobile end-to-end security
143
Compared to WEP, WPA Version 1 will include improvements, such as dynamic keys,
improved message integrity checks, automated key management services, cypher and
authentication negotiation services. WPA Version 2, available 2004, will replace the
currently used RC4 encryption engine with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and
will also support pre-authentication and roaming. 
Using WPA on enterprise WLANs will reduce the need for additional protection mech-
anisms such as VPNs, at least for some business scenarios, though these will still be
necessary when using a public network.
On the transport layer WLAN HTTPS connections are secured like wireline conﬁgura-
tions by applying the SSL/TSL protocol on both the server and the client side.
Other network channels
Mobile networks such as DECT and Home RF are not covered in this book as these
technologies are usually not applied in sensitive business data applications. 
Bluetooth on the other hand has the potential to become the standard for ad hoc net-
works which will play an important role in business scenarios. The Bluetooth security
is not just a simple issue and the standard includes ﬁve different security proﬁles: the
device discovery application proﬁle, the headset proﬁle, the dial-up networking proﬁle,
the LAN access proﬁle and the synchronization proﬁle. Therefore the details are not
covered here, but may be looked up in the Bluetooth Security White Paper [6.3.3]. 
Though the standard already deﬁnes security features for authentication and encryption
that are adequate for many business applications, Bluetooth networks cannot be recom-
mended to be deployed in highly sensitive business solutions or for access to protected
Intranet resources, because there are still some security weaknesses. While encryption
is robust, the challenge is in the initial authentication of a device, where there is a reli-
ance on a possibly insecure exchange of secret keys.
Hopefully this may change within the next years if Bluetooth will become an ofﬁcial
IEEE standard. The Working Group 802.15.1 is currently evaluating how to improve
the Bluetooth security, e.g. by supporting digital certiﬁcates and PKI. 
6.3.2 End-to-end secure application platform
As mentioned previously, particular attention must be paid to ensure that end-to-end
security is fully embedded in modern application architectures and platforms as shown
in ﬁgure 6.11. This includes wired and wireless devices, Internet/Intranet and mobile
networks, gateways, web, portal and application servers as well as legacy systems,
database servers and other enterprise resources. 
The achievement of end-to-end security requires the implementation of several security
techniques in any of the platform elements. The range covers from authentication to
PKI as depicted in ﬁgure 6.11. In the following the security requirements for the differ-
ent platform elements are described.

144
Mobile devices
Enterprises and consumers will seek a variety of devices depending on price, function-
ality, and speciﬁc features optimized for data and voice applications.
Over a period of time, competing platform technologies such as Palm OS, Microsoft’s
Mobile Windows (and Pocket PC, Smartphone), Symbian and even Linux will ﬂood
the marketplace. New technologies such as Sun’s J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition) and
Microsoft’s .NET Compact Framework probably have the potential to change existing
application paradigms. In particular the download capability of objects and applets as
well as interfaces for invoking XML web services directly might provide new applica-
tion potentials but also raise additional security issues.
In general there are some additional security concerns with mobile devices:
– The small size and mobile use make them more likely to be stolen or lost.
– Employees often purchase and use mobile devices without notifying the CIO organi-
zation. 
– Wireless handheld devices are often used for both personal and business data. Users
that purchase these devices on their own often do not consider the security implica-
tions of their use in the work environment.
– Many users have limited security awareness or training with the use of handheld
devices and are not familiar with the potential security risks introduced by these
devices.
– Mobile device users can download a number of programs, games, and utilities,
including freeware and shareware program from untrusted sources. These downloads
may contain Trojan horses or other malicious code that can affect the user’s mobile
device, the user’s PC through synchronization, or the enterprise network resources.

Technically a distinction can be made between WAP devices (mobile phones, PDAs)
and TCP/IP devices (PDAs, laptops). Security techniques and features differ for these
categories as demonstrated in the following.
WAP devices
The WAP Forum has deﬁned standards that take account of the restricted technology of
WAP devices. Published speciﬁcations include WAP 1.1 (1999), WAP 1.2.1 (2000),
WAP 2.0 (2002). 
Included in the WAP standard are security speciﬁcations for WTLS, WMLScript Crypto
Library and WIM/WPKI, which cover authentication, transport encryption, certiﬁcates,
digital signature and PKI support.
WTLS Class 1 deﬁnes mechanisms for key exchange and data conﬁdentiality and integ-
rity.
In addition to class 1 mechanisms, WTLS Class 2 also deﬁnes mechanisms for certiﬁ-
cate based server (WAP gateway) authentication.
In addition to class 2 mechanisms, WTLS Class 3 also deﬁnes mechanisms for certiﬁ-
cate based client (WAP device) authentication.
WMLScript Crypto Library speciﬁes the library interface to provide persistent authen-
tication for transactions that may occur during a WTLS connection. This is required in
many applications, for example e-commerce, where constant proof is needed that
someone has authorized a transaction. The way to provide such proof called signText in
the standard is to associate a digital signature with the data generated as the result of a
transaction, such as a purchase order.
The server must have access to a user’s certiﬁcate in order to verify the digital signa-
ture. The server can do this in several ways:
– The certiﬁcate is appended to the signature.
– The public key hash is appended to the signature. The server is able to fetch the cor-
responding certiﬁcate from a certiﬁcate service.
– A URL of the certiﬁcate is appended to the signature. The server is able to fetch the
certiﬁcate using the Internet.
– The server knows the user certiﬁcate based on a previous data exchange.
The WIM (Wireless Identity Module) is used in performing WTLS and application level
security functions, and especially to store and process information needed for user
identiﬁcation and authentication. The functionality is based on the requirement that
sensitive data, especially keys, can be stored in the WIM, and all operations where
these keys are involved can be performed in the WIM.
A basic requirement for WIM implementation is that it is tamper-resistant. This means
that certain physical hardware protection is used which makes it impossible to extract
or modify information in the module. The technology used in smartcards is an example
of this kind of protection. Regular mobile phones and PDAs cannot be considered

6 Security focus areas
146
tamper-resistant. Extracting information from the module with these devices may be
difﬁcult but still possible with proper equipment.
The WIM usually is implemented on a smartcard. The WIM is deﬁned as an indepen-
dent smartcard application, which makes it possible to implement it as a WIM-only
card or as a part of multi-application card containing other card applications, such as
the SIM. 
For WTLS, the WIM is used for the following purposes:
– performing cryptographic operations during the handshake, especially those used for
client authentication
– securing long-term WTLS secure sessions
The WIM is used to protect permanent, typically certiﬁed, private keys. The WIM
stores these keys and performs operations using these keys. The operations are:
– signing operation for client authentication when needed for the selected handshake
scheme
– key exchange operation using a ﬁxed client key
– the private keys never leave the WIM.
Application level security operations that use the WIM include signing and unwrap-
ping of a key. Both these operations use a private key that also never leaves the WIM.
These operations are meant to be generic in order to serve any applications deﬁned in
WAP (e.g. using WMLScript) or outside WAP.
A key must be unwrapped when an application receives a message key enciphered with
a public key that corresponds to a private key in the WIM. 
Digital signatures may be used for authentication or non-repudiation purposes (e.g. to
sign a document or conﬁrm a transaction = signText operation). A separate key is usu-
ally used for non-repudiation purposes and the user is requested to enter authentication
information (PIN) for every signature made. 
As well as WTLS and WAP application layer security, the WIM may also be used to
secure non-WAP applications that require a tamper-resistant device to perform the fol-
lowing functionalities:
– Signing for authentication purposes (e.g. SSL, TLS)
– Signing for non-repudiation purposes (e.g. S/MIME)
– Private key decryption (e.g. S/MIME)
– Storage of user certiﬁcates (e.g. SSL, TLS, S/MIME)
– Storage of trusted CA (Certiﬁcation Authority) certiﬁcates (e.g. SSL, TLS, 
S/MIME, Java security)
The deployment of WIM and certiﬁcates requires a public key infrastructure which is
speciﬁed in the WPKI standard. 
As well as these security features deﬁned by standards, additional features may also be
implemented depending on the range of SDKs (Software Development Kit) offered by

6.3 Mobile end-to-end security
147
the device vendors. This means that data encryption, VPN or single sign-on might be
implemented if the device is capable of such functions and this security feature is
required by the IT-organisation.
TCP/IP devices
This device category is currently represented by laptops and PDAs. More and more
mobile phones with the standard WAP 2.0 implementation will be part of this category
also.
The main operating systems in this category are Windows XP for Laptops as well as
Palm OS and Windows CE.NET (with its derivations: Pocket PC and Smartphone) for
PDAs. Symbian may be dominating in the smartphone class and Linux may increase its
marketshare in this category in the long term. 
The integrated security features of these operating systems have improved generally in
the recent years but often are not sufﬁcient to allow access to an enterprise’s Intranet
resources. 
Because of the different OS types and versions and the still short product lifecycles, it
does not make sense to take a closer look here to the respective security features. The
details may be captured from vendor’s actual product information or from security
white paper, such as Security on the Pocket PC [6.3.4] and Handheld security for the
mobile enterprise, Palm OS [6.3.5]. 
Instead table 6.1 shows the required security functions, needed for business applica-
tions, distinguishing two different protection levels and considering Windows Mobile
and Palm OS. However this should be taken only as a proposal that will help to give
orientation for IT organizations. In a real security project enterprises must weigh up
carefully risks against measures and may come out with different results.

The level ‘secure access’ is deﬁned as access to intranet resources, which is not consid-
ered at a conﬁdential level and is deployed as interactions in non mission-critical appli-
cations. The level ‘conﬁdential access’ means access to conﬁdential information apply-
ing for example in mission critical applications. 
As operating systems may not have included all of the required security features, 3rd
party software can help to complete the features. Here are some examples of proven
components for PDAs:
– Certicom movianCrypt (authentication, ﬁle encryption, for Windows Mobile and
Palm OS)
– Glück & Kanja Technology AG, CryptoEx Volume (encryption)
– Certicom movianVPN (VPN for Windows Mobile and Palm OS)
– Certicom Trustpoint Client (PKI for Palm OS)
– Entrust VPN client (VPN portal solution for Windows Mobile)
– Checkpoint VPN-1Secure Client (VPN and Personal Firewall for Windows Mobile) 
– F-Secure (Anti-Virus for Windows Mobile and Palm OS)
– Trend Micro PC-cillin (Anti-Virus for Palm OS)
– Trend Micro Ofﬁce Scan (Anti-Virus for Windows Mobile)
Enterprise front-end and back-end
Remote access server, authentication server
Whenever a mobile user wants to access the enterprise Intranet she or he has to dial-in
the Remote Access Server (RAS) ﬁrst. The RAS and a connected authentication server
may provide different authentication mechanisms such as password, Secure-ID card or
certiﬁcate based, e.g. with a smartcard, and may establish the VPN connection. A pure
password authentication is not adequate for allowing access to an Intranet. Instead a
strong authentication method is necessary, i.e. something you know, like a password,
and something you have, like a Secure-ID card or a secret key, must be used in combi-
nation. PKI based authentication methods deploying digital signatures can be assumed
as very acceptable. Methods with a higher security level like retinal scan or ﬁngerprint
scans (representing something you are) are usually not applicable in traditional busi-
ness applications and deployed for speciﬁc solutions only.
RAS are offered by Cisco, 3Com, Nokia and others and should be located in a com-
pany’s trusted environment to prevent authentication manipulation.
Besides the dial-in authentication various other authentication procedures are neces-
sary with e- and m-business solutions, such as WAP gateway authentication,
web/portal/application server authentication and authentication dedicated to applica-
tions as well as single sign-on. These procedures do not run on the RAS, they rather are
integrated in the aforementioned servers and applications. Details are covered in sec-
tion 6.4.

6.3 Mobile end-to-end security
149
WAP gateways
The WAP gateway is operated either by network carriers or by enterprises.
Today’s application platform families for enterprises such as IBM WebSphere, BEA
WebLogic, SUN ONE, Oracle Application Server, SAP NetWeaver and Microsoft
Exchange Server have all integrated WAP gateway functions including authentication,
integrity, conﬁdentiality features with PKI support, compliant to the WAP standards
V. 1.2.1 and V. 2.0. 
Enterprises therefore do not need to install separate WAP gateways if they utilize one
of these application platforms. However they must ensure a trusted environment for the
WAP gateway software because of the exposed data during the process of converting
the WTLS protocol into TLS/SSL and vice versa.
Web server, portal server, application server 
E-business and m-business solutions are based on application platforms. Web server,
portal server, ﬁrewalls and application server typically may be conﬁgured as had been
shown in ﬁgure 6.11. However, dependent on the overall security architecture, the por-
tal server e.g. could be located behind the second ﬁrewall. In principle all of these serv-
ers are required to provide the following security features:
– Authentication
– Role based authorization
– Transport encryption (SSL/TLS)
– Data encryption
– VPN support
– Single sign-on (web applications)
– Digital certiﬁcates, digital signatures
– PKI support
The previously mentioned application platforms (Microsoft, IBM, SAP, BEA, SUN,
Oracle) provide such features more or less based on reliable and modern technologies
(e.g. XML security). 
To guarantee end-to-end security these security features in addition are required on
integration servers and back-end systems. Especially legacy systems often only provide
proprietary protocols and features, which in some cases may cause severe interopera-
bility concerns with modern application platforms.
It is important to point out that even if these mentioned security features are available
and proper implemented in the different systems and servers, security breaches cannot
be excluded. Especially web servers (mainly Microsoft’s IIS) are target of thousands of
hackers, who try to attack enterprise networks daily. Again and again they ﬁnd vulner-
abilities (e.g. buffer overﬂow) and IT-organizations therefore must carefully obey
CERT instructions.

Virtual private networks
In effect, the VPN makes possible the secure exchange of information across a public
network regardless of where the user is geographically and whether she or he is in a
hotel, in an ofﬁce or on the road. The deployment of VPN technology is a must if
employees, customers or partners want to have access to corporate resources in the
Intranet. 
An appropriate enterprise VPN solution should include all mobile devices connectable
via LAN/WLAN/GPRS and regard different connection channels to the enterprise. As
an example the CORINA (Corporate Remote Intranet Access) solution, offered by
Siemens Business Services, provides these different channels as shown in ﬁgure 6.12. 
CORINA is a client/server application consisting of the client parts running on laptops,
tablet PCs and PDAs and the server part running on a Windows or Unix based remote
access server. 
The CORINA family provides 4 distinct access channels, which support different net-
work scenarios:
VPN dial-in 
The dial-in channel provides remote access to the corporate access server via PoP
(Public access Points) lists worldwide. Besides conventional wired access using analog
and digital phone connections, mobile radio networks work on the basis of
GSM/HSCSD. In the latter case a mobile phone is usually connected via infrared to the
laptop. It provides the access to the remote access server via the mobile network. 
VPN Internet 
CORINA PIN (Remote access via Public Internet) affords the user mobility by using
public Internet connections, e.g. from cafes, hotels or airports. In cases where public

resources are used for data communications, security will be shifted from the network
to the applications. Connection is possible via modem, high speed x-DSL or direct
LAN access to the Internet.
VPN GPRS 
This solution offers the user remote access to corporate resources using the GPRS net-
work in two different ways. The laptop user can get secure access to corporate
resources via a GPRS mobile phone connected to the laptop. Alternatively only the
phone is used to get WAP access to appropriate corporate data via a WAP gateway. 
VPN WLAN 
As part of the CORINA solution the wireless access points operated by Siemens Busi-
ness Services are conﬁgured in a secure wireless Extranet and tied into corporate Intra-
nets via secure deﬁned gateways. The WLAN inherent security protocol WEP is not
used in the conceptual CORINA design because of its unsuitability for large-scale
application scenarios. Instead the wireless access point is viewed as a dial-in PoP
(without the actual dial-in) and is used to create a secure wireless Extranet. A dynamic
DHCP (Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol) safeguards transport to the targeted
remote access server of the corporate network. 
6.3.3 Summary and recommendations
The mainstream of mobile business solutions will be the integration into existing e-
business architectures. As end-to-end security mainly means platform embedded secu-
rity it is crucial to implement mobile applications on forward-looking, standard based,
reliable and secure platforms.
Technical, personal and operational security measures must be combined in order to
implement a truly comprehensive information security policy. This means that all the
different perspectives of information security in a company must be taken into account
with regard to the additional mobility aspects. The security policy, security roadmap
and the risk management are the cornerstones of a continuing security process.
The Business Unit level should take into account the various mobile business scenarios
as well as the speciﬁc communication, access, device, processing, environmental, etc.
needs in order to enable the IT organization to set up the right policy and to implement
appropriate security measures.
Finally the Executive level should be aware of the opportunities and risks of mobile
business and should align the security strategy with the business strategy of the com-
pany as a whole.
Enterprises should carefully consider involving experienced security service providers.
Competently managed security services can often avoid signiﬁcant damages by proac-
tively preventing escalating security incidents and thereby save enterprises a lot of
money and reputation.

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
The challenge
About ten percent of the world’s population log onto the Internet at least once a month.
They will use 1 billion different devices, from PCs to mobile phones, to connect from
their homes, work, schools, libraries, cafés and airports. 
Looking ahead, International Data Corp. [6.4.1] estimates that the number of Internet
users worldwide will double between 2001 and 2006, increasing from 500 millions to
1 billion (ﬁgure 6.13).
The wireless Internet/Intranet access and the greater integration of mobile employees,
partners and customers mean another new challenge with average annual growthrate of
about 28% to 400 million users in 2005.
The challenge enterprises face is to ﬁnd the right balance between optimizing accessi-
bility to corporate resources while maintaining sufﬁcient levels of security so as not to
endanger the business. This is a delicate balance that can only be accurately determined
by examining the business context and evaluating the business risk.
6.4.1 Deﬁnitions
Identity
Identity is the digital synonym of a user or an object. The identity should be unambig-
uous and may be a name, a mail address, a passport, a social number, etc. A certiﬁcate
is a secure electronic identity, a digital passport, conforming to the X.509 standard.
Certiﬁcates typically contain a user’s name and public key. 
Network identity refers to the global set of attributes that are contained in an individ-
ual’s various accounts with different service providers. These attributes include such
information as name, phone numbers, social security numbers, addresses, credit
Figure 6.13 Internet/Intranet access

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
153
records and payment information. For individuals, network identity is the sum of their
ﬁnancial, medical and personal data, which must be carefully protected. For busi-
nesses, network identity represents their ability to know their customers and constitu-
ents and reach them in ways that bring value to both parties. 
Identity management
means the control and automation of the process that controls who has access to which
objects, based on their digital identity information. There is a strong emphasis on the
management aspect of enterprise identity management in that many of its facilities are
administrately focused. It provides a single point of administration for provisioning
and deprovisioning accounts, as well as managing the lifecycle of accounts and their
appropriate digital identities.
Authentication 
is the act of proving the identity. To be able to access a web site or resource, a user must
provide authentication via a password or other authentication means like tokens, smart-
cards or biometrics.
Authentication is based on 3 factors: something only you know (e.g. password, PIN),
something only you have (e.g. token, private key) and something only you are (e.g. ﬁn-
gerprint, retina scan). A one-factor authentication often is called simple authentication
while the strong authentication only can be achieved by deploying the two- or three-
factor authentication.
Single Sign-on (SSO)
enables a user to access multiple systems and resources after being authenticated just
one time.
Typically, a user logs in just once, then is transparently granted access to a variety of
permitted services and applications with no further login being required until after the
user logs out. SSO has the advantages of being user friendly and enabling an organiza-
tion to manage authentication consistently, but has the disadvantage of requiring all
systems to trust the same authentication service. Web based SSO-systems use browsers
to provide access to web applications, but access to other enterprise resources and even
legacy systems can be enabled by customizing and deploying special interfaces.
Federated SSO enables users to sign on with one member of an afﬁliate group and sub-
sequently use other sites within the group without having to sign-on again.
Authorization
is the act of granting approval. Authorization to databases or applications is the permis-
sion to get access to these resources by means of e.g. access control lists or certiﬁcates
or other simple or complex access control methods.

6 Security focus areas
154
Access control
comprises of a combination of tasks to guarantee that only authorized users are allowed
to get access to network or enterprise resources. These tasks may include access policy,
authentication, identity management, authorization segregated according to the user’s
roles, auditing, monitoring and supervising.
6.4.2 Authentication techniques and building blocks
Internet as well as enterprise applications which should be protected against unautho-
rized access are supported by authentication techniques and services, which can be
structured in building blocks as shown in ﬁgure 6.14. 
This diagram depicts a quite comprehensive overview in a structured manner. It dem-
onstrates the complexity of authentication consisting of these various building blocks
and the challenge to ﬁt them together suitably in order to achieve end-to-end authenti-
cation or even SSO.
The different layers are described in the following sections.
Authentication methods
As depicted in ﬁgure 6.15 enterprises can choose among different authentication meth-
ods. Usually a combination of some of these methods turns out as the appropriate solu-
tion. 
Alternatives for authentication methods include variations on one of the three authenti-
cation factors – something only you know, something only you have, or something only
you are. These roughly correspond to alphanumeric passwords, access tokens or

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
155
devices, smartcards and biometric devices. Nevertheless, while various technical
mechanisms for authentication each have an inherent strength, the way that organiza-
tions deploy or use them appropriately to the policy is just as important as to provide
real security.
Passwords
remain the dominant identiﬁcation and authentication method in the Internet. Pass-
words require a user or application to enter a character string, which is submitted over
the network and matched against a password database or ﬁle maintained by an authen-
ticating program. Unfortunately, passwords and PINs provide only weak authentication
because there are many points of attack. Only some points of attack can be closed off
by encrypting password information when it is sent over the network.
The weakest link in password/PIN security is the human element. People use short
passwords, some of which are easily guessed or easily fall to dictionary attacks where
a program compares a hashed password value against a dictionary of words, or word
combinations. PINs or short numeric strings are inherently weak. Only strong pass-
words such as 225.xA6$zo can stand up to dictionary attack.
Enterprises should use only strong passwords and set up strict policies. These include
educating users not to write their passwords down and locking accounts after a small
number of invalid logon attempts. Frequent password expiry is another strong and
often used password policy. In general, strict password policies tend to increase end-
user training and support costs. Such policies may also decrease usability. There is a
trend towards self-service password management, which leverages a directory to con-
trol one’s own proﬁle. That proﬁle is then reused on many systems through password
synchronization, password reset, or login redirection.
Tokens
Access tokens or devices represent the something you have authentication factor. They
can be provided through hardware tokens, software tokens, or other types of systems.
For each type of access token, organizations must consider not only the ability of the
Figure 6.15
Authentication methods

6 Security focus areas
156
token itself to protect the secret algorithms on which authentication depends, but also
its ability to create a trusted veriﬁcation path between the user, the client device and the
authentication server. 
Typically, access token solutions create the trusted veriﬁcation path by protecting pri-
vate keys in hardware and/or encrypting shared secret keys over the network. Organi-
zations should also put time and effort into designing the policies for identifying the
user and issuing tokens to users. 
Typical hardware tokens are devices such as RSA Security’s SecurID that display num-
ber sequences. These sequences change on a ﬁxed one-minute interval to create one-
time passwords with PINs, or challenge/response devices such as ActivCard, that have
a display plus a numeric keypad. 
In the challenge/response scenario, a user starts a logon session by typing in a user ID.
If the user ID is validated, a number is returned to the screen, which represents the chal-
lenge. The user then enters this number into the hand-held device and the device
returns another – the response. The user types this response into the logon session and
if it is accepted, the system logs the user in.
Software tokens operate similarly to hardware tokens, except that a software program
installed on a user’s device provides the token generator, or the challenge/response
system.
Smartcards/SIM cards 
In general the smartcard is a special type of token as it is a multifunctional tool and can
be used in a whole range of enterprise security applications. 
Smartcards or known as processor based chipcards, ICC (Integrated Circuit Card),
have been standardized for more than 10 years (ISO 7816) and deployed in many dif-
ferent application scenarios: Admission control for buildings and rooms, cashless staff
restaurant payment, user authentication for applications and networks and digital sig-
natures as proof of origin for electronic documents are some of the possibilities that
have been applied so far. This makes the smartcard an ideal tool for realizing applica-
tions such as employee identity cards that comprise a multitude of different applica-
tions. 
One example is the Siemens Corporate Card which is deployed as an employee identity
card worldwide, which is used for admission control and for severel security applica-
tions based on private keys stored on the smartcard and on a corporate wide PKI. 
Secrets such as private keys are best stored in tamper-resistant modules. Smartcards are
based on such tamper-resistant chip technology that implies hardware and software
protection measures and represents a very high security level. Moreover these media
are state of the art, portable, standardized and exchangeable among different devices,
which means that users carry their private keys with them like a credit card and can use
them with various devices.
SIM cards used in mobile phones are based on the same processor based ICC technol-
ogy and ISO standard 7816 but are now mainly used only as a token to authenticate

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
157
subscribers to their network. However this will soon change since mobile devices com-
pliant with the WAP standard 1.2 or 2.0 are now available on the mass market. Part of
this standard is the Wireless Identiﬁcation Module. As depicted previously WIM pro-
vides a dedicated speciﬁcation for security token for users, which includes private keys
and user certiﬁcates as well as cryptographic functions. 
Biometric devices
Biometric authentication matches some physical characteristics (representing some-
thing you are) of a user against a database record. Common methods include retinal,
palm, or ﬁngerprint scans as well as voice recognition. After years of development,
these systems have become more reliable, yielding fewer false positives and false neg-
atives. Prices are also falling, making biometrics increasingly practical, though still far
more expensive than the free password.
Technically, biometric authentication is the strongest form of authentication because a
person cannot change easily such a basic personal attribute as the retinal blood-vessel
pattern, ﬁngerprint, or vocal-tract conﬁguration. However, organizations must ensure
that the biometric system, like any physical access device, provides a trusted veriﬁca-
tion path between the user and the authentication service. 
Some promising hybride approaches combine portable smartcard devices with biomet-
ric data: private key, password, and user veriﬁcation process are all protected through
local encryption and PIN access.
Digital certiﬁcates/PKI
PKI is an infrastructure used for both authentication and encryption. It combines soft-
ware, encryption technologies and services to protect network communications and e-
business transactions. PKI involves a system of digital certiﬁcates – an attachment to an
electronic message that can encrypt data and verify that the sender is who he or she
claims to be – as well as certiﬁcate authorities, a third party that issues the digital cer-
tiﬁcate. PKI protects information assets by authenticating identity using a digital certif-
icate, verifying integrity by ensuring that messages have not been manipulated or data
corrupted and ensuring privacy by protecting information from interception during
transit. 
Authentication protocols and standards
As depicted in ﬁgure 6.14 several authentication protocols are intended for general-
purpose use by multiple applications. Standards authentication protocols include the
Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Remote Access Dial-in
User Services (RADIUS), Kerberos V5, Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML), XML Signatures (XML-Sig) and others. In addition, public-key and other
cryptographic frameworks provide security mechanisms and data formats to the proto-
cols. These include X.509 certiﬁcate formats, Public Key Cryptography Standards
(PKCS), as well as other mechanisms, e.g. for hashing such as Digest-MD5, Secure
Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) and the emerging Advanced Encryption System (AES) stand-
ard.

158
Remote Access Dial-in User Services (RADIUS)
RADIUS [6.4.2] is a today widely used protocol for authenticating dial-in or Internet
access based on a central security server model. RADIUS encrypts user ID/password
information or challenge/response token information over the network.
While initially created to support remote or network access servers, RADIUS has
evolved to provide a standard mechanism for Internet service providers (ISPs) to relay
authentication requests back to corporate customers. Particularly popular on the Virtual
Private Network (VPN) environment, product lines from Check Point, Cisco, RSA
SecurID, and many others implement RADIUS as a front-end authentication mecha-
nism to corporate authentication services.
Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL)
TLS/SSL [6.4.3] deploys a handshaking procedure to authenticate the server and the
client through X.509 certiﬁcates, to negotiate the algorithms for the session, and to
exchange session keys for encryption and message digests. The client authentication
(optionally) requires that the client has the server’s public key or certiﬁcate. TLS/SSL
is used for web client authentication; the certiﬁcates in TLS are actually issued to the
client’s device and its software, not to any person or application using the device.
Secure Shell (SSH)
SSH [6.4.4] is a secure protocol and set of tools for secure, remote user authentication
and access to servers. SSH can be used to secure any network-based trafﬁc by binding
it to a certain port at both ends. SSH runs on most UNIX systems, NT, and client plat-
forms, and there are open source SSH solutions for these environments. The SSH pro-
tocol consists of three major components: The TLS provides server authentication,
conﬁdentiality, and integrity, the User Authentication Protocol authenticates the client
to the server, and the Connection Protocol multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into several
logical channels. 
X.509
The X.500 directory standards published by the ITU contain a subsection, X.509
[6.4.5], which sets out recommendations for an authentication services framework.
X.509 deﬁnes both a detailed syntax for certiﬁcates and an operational protocol deﬁn-
ing how a certiﬁcate is used for authentication.
Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
PKCS is an X.509-compatible system that uses public key technology to specify
details, such as encryption algorithms and key formats. The PKCS standards [6.4.6]
consist of a series of documents published by RSA, covering the deﬁnitions of algo-
rithm, message syntax, certiﬁcates, attributes, and other cryptographic details. PKCS
#7 and PKCS #10, for example, are widely used for certiﬁcate enrollment requests.

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
159
Kerberos
Kerberos [6.4.7] developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a widely used
authentication system and an Internet standard. It is an open standard for distributed
systems authentication. It relies on shared secret (or password) authentication by users
to an authentication server that is called Key Distribution Center (KDC). The KDC
issues tickets to the users and grants them access to applications. The KDC concept
provides optional delegation of access from one application service to another and
optional interdomain trusts between groups of KDCs. As such, Kerberos is the only
broadly implemented protocol to provide end-to-end conﬁrmation of user identity and
authentication across multiple application services in a distributed interaction scenario.
Kerberos standard support is now relatively commonplace in UNIX as well as Win-
dows environments. However while Microsoft Kerberos can interoperate with UNIX
Kerberos, authorization compatibility is limited.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
When combined with XML-based remote procedure calls (RPCs) such as the Simple
Object Access Protocol (SOAP), SAML [6.4.8] serves as a distributed authentication
protocol between authentication and other security services. SAML allows loosely
coupled security domains with heterogeneous systems and authentication methods to
federate authentication. While SAML is much newer than other authentication meth-
ods, it is being adopted very rapidly by many authentication systems.
Authentication APIs
The next layer in ﬁgure 6.14 comprises the authentication APIs. Important APIs for
authentication include the Generic Security Service (GSS) API, Java Authentication
and Authorization Service (JAAS), Microsoft Security Support Provider Interface
(SSPI) and CryptoAPI, the Java Cryptography Architecture, Intel’s Common Data
Security Architecture (CDSA) API, and Novell’s Modular Authentication Service
(NMAS).
Generic Security Service (GSS) API
GSS API is a standard set of generic programing interfaces designed for security ser-
vices, including authentication, data integrity, and data conﬁdentiality. GSS has been
implemented with Kerberos on UNIX systems. Windows, however, doesn’t support
GSS. Thus, GSS has only limited reach even in Unix environments.
Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) and CryptoAPI
Microsoft’s SSPI is conceptually similar to GSS API, providing a generalized security
framework that hides the details of authentication and cryptography from the applica-
tion. CryptoAPI allows applications to invoke speciﬁc cryptographic functions without
needing special knowledge of the algorithms. CryptoAPI invokes pluggable crypto-
graphic service provider (CSP) modules. SSPI manages authentication processes and is

6 Security focus areas
160
the high-level interface to Kerberos, while CryptoAPI handles low-level cryptographic
functions.
Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) and 
Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)
The Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) provides an interface to
multiple forms of authentication, including passwords, Kerberos tickets, and certiﬁ-
cates. It implements a Java version of the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)
framework originally developed by Sun, which has gained favor among UNIX vendors
and Open Group members. JAAS and PAM offer open and ﬂexible frameworks for a
growing number of UNIX platforms and Java-based applications.
Common Data Security Architecture (CDSA)
Initial work done by Intel, the Open Group’s Security Working Group has continued to
maintain and extend the CDSA speciﬁcations. Unlike CryptoAPI, CDSA is indepen-
dent of an operating system. A Common Security Service Manager (CSSM) core pro-
vides the framework for plug-in security services that provide cryptographic, certiﬁcate
storage, and authentication services. CDSA has support from platform vendors such as
IBM, and Hewlett-Packard.
Novell Modular Authentication Service (NMAS)
NMAS is similar to PAM, CDSA, SSPI and offers a pluggable authentication interface.
NMAS leverages the Novell eDirectory, and has been implemented in Novell’s prod-
ucts as well as some third-party applications.
Internet and enterprise SSO services
On the top of the authentication layers (which are shown in ﬁgure 6.14) Internet and
enterprise SSO services make the building blocks diagram complete.
SSO services enable users after being authenticated just one time, transparently granted
access to a variety of permitted services and applications with no further login being
required until after the user logs out. SSO usually provides identiﬁcation, authentiﬁca-
tion and authorization services.
The following sections describe different web-based SSO approaches and technolo-
gies. The depicted SSO technologies are classiﬁed differently: 
Microsoft Passport is a service provided only by Microsoft, but may be taken advan-
tage of any Internet shop, such as e-bay. The Liberty Alliance Project is a technology
initiative, just deﬁning a set of speciﬁcations and has no intention to develop products
or to offer SSO services. Entrust GetAccess, RSA ClearTrust and Netegrity SiteMinder
are available independent SSO-products, which can be integrated in different enter-
prises’ infrastructures. Finally SAP Enterprise Portal SSO and IBM WebSphere/Tivoli
SSO are in SAP’s respectively in IBM’s middleware fully integrated SSO systems.

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
161
6.4.3 Microsoft .NET Passport
Intention and trade-offs
Microsoft .NET Passport [6.4.9] consists of a suite of services for authenticating
(Microsoft calls it: signing in) users across a number of devices and Internet sites
(applications). The Passport single sign-in service provides authentication for users by
allowing them to create a single set of credentials that enable them to sign-in to any site
that supports a Passport service. An example is the e-bay web site [6.4.x]. On the bot-
tom of this web page is just a small button Sign in, where users are able to authenticate
themselves against the e-bay site by pressing the button, using the Microsoft’s Passport
mechanism. 
Passport can help providers allow customers to identify themselves across all of a web
site’s applications, so that users can go to the providers’ web site, interact with all of
their account information, pay bills, and get the kind of experience they want. The pro-
vider (or any enterprise) fulﬁls one of its critical infrastructure needs (authentication),
and is able to build a deeper digital relationship with its customers. The provider con-
tinues to hold all of its customer’s data; it simply relies on Passport to ensure that users
identify themselves with the same username and password from visit to visit. 
Users have the control over the amount of information they reveal to participating Pass-
port sites. Those who want to have forms ﬁlled, or to take advantage of other special-
ized services, may choose to share all of their proﬁle information. Those who prefer to
be identiﬁed only by their Passport identity, and no personal information, can decline
those services, or can create an account with nothing more than a username and pass-
word.
The challenge is to develop a balanced solution that provides the highest degree of pri-
vacy and security with the lowest impact on usability. 
It is important to recognize that there are tradeoffs between these privacy and security
priorities and the other things consumers want from their online experience, such as
convenience and usability. Passport can provide a certain level of ﬂexibility to make
these tradeoffs desired by both businesses and users. 
For example, some consumers want strict privacy – some even want anonymity – but
few want to give up the kind of personalized services and custom features that web
sites can only provide if they have certain types of personal information about their
users. Consumers also say they want high levels of security, but not every Internet site
warrants the same level of security as a banking transaction. Some applications could
require users to create “strong” passwords, with eight or more characters that combine
letters, numbers and symbols. However, strong passwords are hard for most computer
users to remember and difﬁcult for them to type. 
Authentication Process and Single Sign-in
Passport uses the Kerberos security mechanisms with some extensions. Passport
authentication messages are passed in the form of electronic tickets that are used to tell
the accessed site that the user has signed in successfully. A ticket is simply a small

6 Security focus areas
162
amount of data that tells at what time the sign-in occurred, when the user last manually
signed-in and other information that is useful to the authentication process. Within the
Passport system, these tickets take the form of cookies. Figure 6.16 shows the different
steps of the authentication and single sign-in process.
Step 1: A user who has been registered at Passport.com and owns a Passport account
wants to access a protected web page at site A. She or he clicks on the standard Pass-
port sign in logo on the protected page to get a ticket.
Step 2: User is redirected to Passport.
Step 3: Passport checks user’s cookie to see if the user already has an active ticket. As
this is the ﬁrst authentication no active ticket has been issued so far. Passport removes
information that site A passed on the query string and redirects the user to a page that
asks for the user’s sign in name and password. After entering the correct information
the process goes to step 4.
Step 4: The user is redirected back now to site A. Attached as cookies they bring two
encrypted packets of information. The ﬁrst cookie contains the authentication ticket
information. The second contains any proﬁle information that the user has chosen to
share, and any operational information and unique identiﬁers that need to be passed.
These packets are encrypted with a unique secret key that is shared between Passport
and site A only.
Step 5: Site A decrypts authentication ticket and proﬁle information, and signs the user
into their site. Site A then takes this information and uses it to issue their own cookies.
Now that site A knows the user has been authenticated by Passport, site A can take it
from here and use the Passport User ID to look a user up in appropriate databases as
well as perform authorization tasks. The proﬁle information can be used to personalize
the user’s experience.
Figure 6.16 Passport single sign-in process

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
163
Step 6: User accesses the page, resource or service he or she requested from site A.
Step 7: The same user now wants to access site B. She or he clicks on the standard
Passport sign in logo on the protected page of site B.
Step 8: User is redirected to Passport.
Step 9: Passport checks user’s cookie to see if the user has an active ticket. In this case
the user already has been issued an active ticket. Therefore Passport does not need to
redirect the user to the sign in the page as described in step 3. Instead the user is redi-
rected to site B immediately. Usually step 7, 8, and 9 will not be noticed at all by the
user. 
However site B has some choices to make about how to authenticate this user. Since the
ticket contains the time that it was issued, it allows the referring site to decide how
fresh the cookie needs to be in order to accept it. If the ticket meets the rules site B has
chosen, the user is redirected back to the referring site along with the encrypted ticket
and proﬁle cookies. If the ticket is too old, the user is prompted to re-enter her or his
credentials.
All participating sites can choose how old the ticket-granting-cookie can be before they
will reject it. In addition, all participating sites have the option of requiring the user to
reenter his or her password regardless of what cookies they have, and how fresh they
are. By forcing a user to re-type credentials, the ability of someone, who does not know
the user’s password to access that user’s information can be eliminated. Sites collecting
sensitive information, such as ﬁnancial services web sites, are encouraged to use this
feature. It is unlikely that a site that only displays low security items such as localized
news or weather would force the user to re-type his or her credentials.
Step 10: This step is identically to step 4 with regard to site B.
Step 11: User accesses the page, resource, or service requested from site B.
From the user’s perspective any further accesses to sites X will occur in the same man-
ner as described in steps 7 to 11. Her or his experience is the single sign-in regardless
how many sites are going to be accessed. 
Users may sign out of Passport by clicking the Passport sign-out logo on any participat-
ing site. Then all Passport cookies from all of the participating sites visited during the
browser session are deleted from their computer. 
Users can choose to be signed in to Passport automatically in the future. If a user
checks the box authorizing the automatic sign-in feature, the user will not always see
the Passport sign-in page and will not always have to type in his or her username and
password while using that computer. Instead, the user will be able to use freely partici-
pating sites without having to input any information, and participating sites will receive
the user’s proﬁle information consistent with the user’s consent. To disable the auto-
matic feature, a user simply has to select the Passport sign-out link at any participating
site.

Additional Passport services
Security key
Passport offers an optional second layer of security that participating web sites can
control. If a site has standard security needs, it can offer users an easy, straightforward
online experience with the single user name and password in Passport. Sites with
higher security needs can choose to require a secondary security key (a four-digit PIN
in addition to a password) that must be entered before the user can complete a sensitive
transaction or view conﬁdential information. Unlike the password, this PIN cannot be
stored on a computer; it must be presented by the user and passed over a secure,
encrypted channel every time it is requested.
Passport express purchase (.NET Passport Wallet)
An optional adjunct to the single sign-in service is the Passport express purchase ser-
vice. This service facilitates fast, easy online purchasing by allowing consumers to cre-
ate a .NET Passport wallet, storing his or her billing and shipping information. With
this service, consumers can make online purchases at any participating .NET Passport
express purchase site by signing into their wallet and, with a few clicks, sending pur-
chase information to the merchant, without having to retype their information. The data
is sent using SSL encryption.
Kids Passport services
The Kids Passport Services give web sites, doing business in the United States, tools to
help them comply with the parental consent requirements of the Children’s Online Pri-
vacy Protection Act (COPPA), which went into effect in April 2000. Parents can use the
Kids Passport service to modify proﬁle information their children can share with Pass-
port participating web sites, subject to certain exceptions described in the Passport Pri-
vacy Statement. Parents can also choose a consent level to determine the extent to
which participating Kids Passport sites collect, use, and share children’s personal infor-
mation.
Support of mobile devices
Passport provides support for Windows Mobile. Because mobile devices implement
different browser technologies and are limited in terms of screen size, input and graph-
ics capabilities, some Passport features are not supported on these devices in the cur-
rent version. Nevertheless mobile users have access to key features like registration,
single sign-in, sign-out.
Passport currently supports the following browsers: Microsoft Mobile Explorer
(MME), HTML or WAP-mode, i-mode phones, WAP phones, HDML (Handheld
Device Markup Language) phones.

Deployment
Enterprises that want to deploy and use Passport on their own web sites must sign the
non-exclusive .NET Service Agreement. The standard .NET Service Agreement also
includes a base service-level agreement (SLA). Sites with very high volumes may
negotiate higher-level SLAs to meet their speciﬁc needs.
By signing the .NET Service Agreement, the participating site is committing to speciﬁc
business guidelines that protect the personal information of Passport users and help
ensure the integrity of the system.
For example, the contract states that all participating sites must post a privacy statement
online and make it readily accessible to their users. Microsoft states to encourage
strongly all sites to register with an independent, industry-recognized, privacy-assur-
ance body such as TRUSTe.
Passport today is used as authentication service for Microsoft’s MSN and Hotmail as
well as for some other web sites.
Comments to .Net Passport
Passport strength is the balance and ﬂexibility regarding security, privacy and usability
for the most Internet applications and services excluding such which require a very
high security level. 
Customers often visit sites only occasionally, however many users cannot remember
their logon credentials. If they fail three times to enter the information correctly, they
must call e.g. a toll-free number to have their identity veriﬁed and to receive a new user
name and password. The company’s records show that many users simply give up at
this point – and for those who continue, the company’s support costs associated with
the password reset are high. With Passport, the company may have an easy way to
authenticate both new and repeat customers and stop losing sales from frustrated con-
sumers, and the users can focus on their shopping and have a much better experience. 
Nonetheless there are some current restrictions which limit the deployment of Passport
as well as there are requirements for future Passport versions:
– Passport currently does not offer stronger forms of authentication such as multifactor
authentication where the users must present something they have (such as a digital
certiﬁcate, smart card or hardware token) as well as something they know (such as
their PIN or password) to be strongly authenticated.
– More transparency for users and enterprises and the deﬁnition of control objectives
as well as control activities examined by an independent auditing ﬁrm would help for
more conﬁdence in Microsoft’s Passport services.
– Consumers cannot determine which private information should be transferred to
what site.
– Companies which deploy Passport are not able to modify any Passport registration
formats or authentication procedures. Existing authentication methods cannot be
integrated or adopted unless deploying them in parallel. Passport cannot be deployed
for non web legacy applications.

6 Security focus areas
166
– Currently Passport cannot interoperate with any other existing authentication meth-
ods.
Customers and enterprises are still concerned about unauthorized people, who may be
able to misuse or manipulate private data or enterprise assets. Therefore transparency
and the examination of independent auditing are mandatory for common trust in Pass-
port. 
However Microsoft states that Passport will be adding support for WS-Security so that
it can securely interoperate with other systems that support the WS-Security standard.
By integrating these standards into its products and services, Microsoft will create a
broad-based solution that will enable a host of federated security scenarios. In some of
these scenarios, Passport becomes a node in a broader federation network. 
In addition, Microsoft will be releasing new authentication technology code-named
TrustBridge, which customers will be able to purchase and operate themselves. The
TrustBridge technologies will provide customers with an integration point for their
nodes in a broader federation system. TrustBridge will be deployed at the edge of the
network and will speak WS-Security to the outside world. TrustBridge will talk to user
directories within the customer organization that are based on Active Directory or a
third-party Kerberos-based system. Because both Passport and TrustBridge will be
speaking WS-Security, companies that deploy TrustBridge will have the technology
necessary to federate with the Passport service if they choose to do so.
As Passport up to now has not been successfully deployed outside Microsoft’s own
services, a major change is probable and may result in new Identity Services, which
may be more oriented on the Liberty Alliance approach. 
6.4.4 Liberty Alliance project
The Liberty Alliance Project [6.4.10] represents a broad spectrum of industries united
to drive a new level of trust, commerce, and communication on the Internet. Today
one’s identity on the Internet is fragmented across various identity providers like enter-
prises, Internet Portals, communities, business services. The result is cumbersome, the
user experience is disappointing. 
The federated network identity and single sign-on are key to solve this problem. The
federated network identity approach is based on an open architecture and other than
Microsoft’s Passport not dependent on one company’s technology and identity ser-
vices. It is intended to position SSO services based on the Liberty standards in the mar-
ket against Microsoft Passport. 
Liberty objectives
The key objectives of Liberty are to
– enable consumers to protect the privacy and security of their network identity infor-
mation,
– enable businesses to maintain and manage their customer relationships without third
party participation,

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
167
– provide an open single sign-on standard that includes decentralized authentication
and authorization from multiple providers,
– create a network identity infrastructure that supports all current and emerging net-
work access devices.
These capabilities can be achieved when businesses afﬁliate together in circles of trust
and on operational agreements that deﬁne trust relationships between businesses and in
addition when users federate the otherwise isolated accounts they have with these busi-
nesses. 
Federated network identity
Today, there are many islands of identity across the Internet. Every business connected
to the Internet has an identity system for its employees. Most telecom companies, ISPs
and other Internet networks (such as Yahoo! or AOL) also have systems for maintaining
the identities of their users.
Federated network identity is the key to reduce this friction and realizing new business
opportunities. In the new world of federated commerce, a user’s online identity, per-
sonal proﬁle, personalized online conﬁgurations, buying habits and history, travel and
shopping preferences will be administered by the user and securely shared with the
organizations of the user’s choice. 
Federated network identity means consumers and enterprises can allow separate enti-
ties to manage different sets of identity information. Account federation enables asso-
ciating, connecting or binding a user’s multiple Internet accounts within an afﬁliated
group established between or among commercial and non-commercial organizations
and governed by legal agreements.
Federated security is the ability for sites, services and applications to accept and recog-
nize safely identities and authentication assertions issued by any one of a trusted set of
partners.
Based on Liberty architecture and operational agreements there are circles of trust with
which users can transact in a secure and apparently seamless environment as shown in
ﬁgure 6.17.
From a Liberty perspective, the actors are the users, service providers, and identity pro-
viders. The service provider category includes any organization on the web today, e.g.
Internet portals, retailers, transportation providers, ﬁnancial institutions, entertainment
companies, not-for-proﬁt organizations, governmental agencies, etc.
Identity providers are service providers offering business incentives so that other ser-
vice providers afﬁliate with them. Establishing such relationships creates the circles of
trust shown in the ﬁgure. For example, in the enterprise circle of trust, the identity pro-
vider is leveraging employee network identities across the enterprises. Another exam-
ple is the consumer circle of trust, where the user’s bank has established business rela-
tionships with various other service providers allowing the user to wield his/her bank-

6 Security focus areas
168
based network identity with them. A single organization may be both an identity pro-
vider and a service provider, either generally or for a given interaction.
These scenarios are enabled by service providers and identity providers deploying Lib-
erty-enabled products in their infrastructure, but do not require users to use anything
other than today’s common web browser.
Used techniques
Web Redirects
Liberty makes use of the HTTP command 302 Temporary Redirect. Such 302 web redi-
rects work by placing the URI of another location in the Location ﬁeld of an HTTP
Response. The browser receiving such a response is obliged to perform an HTTP GET
specifying the URI so conveyed in the HTTP response. This allows Liberty to create a
communications channel between Identity Providers and Service Providers. During a
Liberty web redirect, some private information about the user often travels in the HTTP
message. This information needs to be protected. This is accomplished through the use
of HTTPS.
SSL
SSL encrypts all HTTP communications between the client and server, so that even if
an HTTP message is intercepted, the user information is protected. SSL has three main
steps: the browser authenticates the server, the browser generates a session key, the
server and the browser agree all further communications will be encrypted.
Figure 6.17 Liberty Alliance: federated network identity

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
169
SOAP and SAML
Liberty protocols exchange identity information through pre-existing protocols and
languages, SOAP and SAML respectively, as well as web redirects. The SOAP enve-
lope is a framework for expressing what is in a message, who should handle it, and
whether it is optional or mandatory. SOAP also has encoding rules for exchanging
application-deﬁned datatypes, exactly what is needed in Liberty. SOAP also has
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), which are used in Liberty.
SAML deﬁnes three types of assertions: authentication, attribute, and authorization
decision. Liberty uses authentication assertions, which state that subject S was authen-
ticated at time T by means M.
In summary, SAML authentication assertions are conveyed by either SOAP or web
redirects in order to accomplish exchange of identity and authentication information.
Single sign-on process
In ﬁgure 6.18 and explanation one example scenario demonstrates the Liberty single
sign-on processes from a user’s perspective.
Step 1: At the Service Provider’s web site, the user selects an Identity Provider for her
or his identity authentication (or the Service Provider selects one for the user based on
whatever approach is being used for introduction). He or she may press a button at the
Service Provider’s web site to select an Identity Provider, may ﬁll in a form at the Ser-
vice Provider’s web site or may be requesting some resource and the Service Provider
determines the Identity Provider from context. The mechanism that is used to transmit
this information is an HTTP Request submitted by the user’s browser.
Figure 6.18 Liberty Alliance: single sign-on process

6 Security focus areas
170
Step 2: The Service Provider determines the address of the Identity Provider and gener-
ates an alternate URI pointing at the Identity Provider.
Step 3: The Service Provider responds to the user’s browser with an HTTP Response
and an alternate URI in the location header ﬁeld. The alternate URI ﬁeld has a second,
embedded URI pointing back to the Service Provider. 
Now the Liberty protocol varies, depending on whether it is based on GETs, POSTs, or
WML browsers. What will be explained here and onwards is the most common sce-
nario, HTTP GETs.
Step 4: The user’s browser performs an HTTP GET Request to the Identity Provider
with the URI from the location ﬁeld received in Step 3 as the argument of the Request.
Step 5: The Identity Provider processes the user’s HTTP GET Request. If the user has
not yet been authenticated by the Identity Provider, authentication occurs now.
Step 6: The Identity Provider responds with an authentication assertion, a SAML arti-
fact, or an error. The response is conveyed using HTTP Redirect whose location header
contains the URI pointing to the Service Provider (This has been extracted from the
GET argument URI of Step 4).
Step 7: The user’s browser obtains the artifact or assertion. The user sends an HTTP
GET Request to the Service Provider using the complete URI taken from location ﬁeld
of the response received in Step 6.
Step 8: This step occurs only if the Step 6 response was a SAML artifact. (Recall that a
SAML artifact is a small random number designed to point to SAML assertions. It is
passed between sites using web redirects and embedding it in URL query strings.) The
Service Provider now needs to get an authentication assertion corresponding to the arti-
fact it received. The Service Provider sends a SOAP message to the Identity Provider,
requesting the assertion.
Step 9: The step occurs only if the Step 6 response was a SAML artifact.
The Identity Provider processes the request, and responds with the corresponding
assertion.
Step 10: The Service Provider sends an HTTP Response completing the user’s original
HTTP request in Step 1.
Comments to Liberty
The Liberty Alliance project offers the most open and standard-based approach and is
designed as SSO platform for B2C, B2E and B2B equally. 
As the Liberty Alliance Project’s results are not products but speciﬁcations it will take
some time those reliable products representing the latest speciﬁcation will be available
on the market. (Security specialists like Baltimore and Entrust probably will be among
the ﬁrst).

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
171
Liberty and web services-(WS)security both will deploy XML-based security like
SAML, XML Signature, XML Encryption, XACML (Access Control), XKMS (Key
Management) and therefore can be assumed as forward-looking and safeguarding tech-
nologies. However there are years to come and up to now there is no evidence whether
major security holes can be avoided and whether the complex federation mechanism
will work sufﬁciently in a mass market.
Though .NET Passport and Liberty represent different identity approaches and mecha-
nisms the services may hopefully become interoperable within the next years.
6.4.5 Entrust GetAccess
Other than .NET Passport, the SSO service GetAccess from Entrust is targeted to the
enterprise market and is designed to be integrated in an existing application environ-
ment with existing and different security mechanisms. And other than Liberty, GetAc-
cess is not a set of speciﬁcations but a real service consisting of various components.
Portfolio
As the foundation of the Entrust Secure Web Portal solution [6.4.11], the Entrust
GetAccess portfolio delivers a single entry and access point for user identiﬁcation and
entitlements across web portal applications. 
Entrust GetAccess software centralizes security management and delivers the follow-
ing services and features:
Identiﬁcation, authentication and single sign-on 
GetAccess provides Single Sign-On (SSO) for web resources and applications in a web
site deployment. Once a user has identiﬁed him of herself to the GetAccess server, no
further application layer authentication is needed. GetAccess will verify the user’s cre-
dentials and inform the application of the user’s identity. 
GetAccess gives the ﬂexibility to make use of a set of authentication mechanisms for
deployment. Support is provided for authentication schemes including:
– Username/Password
– External LDAP directory
– X.509v3 digital certiﬁcates
– Tokens (including RSA SecurID)
– Windows Domain Authentication
Entitlements – authorization and roles-based access control
The GetAccess software delivers Entitlements (authorizations) via a Roles-Based
Access Control (RBAC) model. This model uses the notion of roles as a layer of
abstraction between users and the resources they need to access. Initially, an adminis-
trator can access the resources that need to be protected and deﬁne the roles that are

6 Security focus areas
172
needed to access each of those resources. Then, as users are created, they can be
assigned roles appropriate to their relationship with and within the organization. Then
GetAccess can calculate dynamically the resources that a user’s roles allow him or her
to access. This abstraction reduces the effort needed for an administrator to manage
large numbers of users and privileges.
Dynamic resource menu
Once a user has been authenticated and authorized, GetAccess renders a personalized
HTML menu that reﬂects the resources and applications for which the user is granted
access. This allows users to navigate quickly through their applications without having
to remember or bookmark various URLs. In addition, since this menu is dynamically
generated, it will continue to give the user a real-time and up-to-date view of his or her
privileges each time it is accessed. The resources displayed on this personalized screen
will be recalculated with each access, reﬂecting all updates to his or her privileges.
Multi-domain access 
As organizations merge, form partnerships with other organizations, and/or branch out
into various brands, it becomes imperative to extend the same Identiﬁcations and Enti-
tlements privileges across multiple Internet domains. However, due to an inherent lim-
itation in the way cookies are implemented, they cannot be shared across multiple
domains. And, since cookies are the primary containers for delivery of credentials to
the browser, this is a substantial technical hurdle for providing cross-domain SSO and
Entitlements.
GetAccess overcomes this hurdle, and provides multi-domain support for authentica-
tion, authorization, session management, real-time revocation, and logout.
Customizable look & feel
The HTML pages that GetAccess software generates are template driven, making it
straightforward to change the look-and-feel of the implementation to match the rest of
the site. Updating the pages that a user will see is easy by making the appropriate mod-
iﬁcations to the provided templates. 
Web-based & delegated administration 
The GetAccess server ships with a browser-based administration tool. This tool can be
used to manage all the users, roles resources, and other objects and parameters within
the GetAccess server. Since this tool only requires a browser, there is no installation
required on the administrators’ machines. In additon an organization can allow admin-
istrators to be remote while being able to manage the security infrastructure. 
GetAccess enables the delegation of administrative activity. The delegation model pro-
vides the possibility to give many different levels of administrative privileges to differ-
ent delegated administrators.

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
173
User self-service and automated provisioning
Self-service allows users to enroll themselves without any administrative intervention
into the GetAccess server and dynamically receive appropriate privileges based on
their relationship with the organization.
GetAccess is capable of leveraging an existing user management repository such as an
LDAP directory or a Windows Domain infrastructure. A user that exists in the external
directory can self-enroll and obtain a GetAccess account by presenting authentication
credentials for that external directory. GetAccess validates these credentials against
that directory and automatically creates a corresponding GetAccess account for this
user if the authentication attempt is successful.
GetAccess also provides user self-service capabilities for maintaining their accounts.
Authenticated users can manage their own accounts by selecting preferences and man-
aging their passwords.
Non-web application integration
The GetAccess portfolio provides a toolkit that allows organizations to integrate cli-
ent/server or other non-web applications into the GetAccess systems to leverage the
Identiﬁcation and Entitlements services that it provides. This API, known as CAAS
(Client Authentication and Authorization Service), is implemented in Java and C++.
The CAAS provides a programmatic interface to GetAccess functionality. It can be
used to authenticate users, obtain their credentials, request and enforce access control
decisions, and verify the validity of user sessions. CAAS can also be used to build the
same functionality for non-web environments that GetAccess software delivers for web
applications.
APIs and extensions
In order to support the integration of GetAccess into enterprises environments, the
product provides APIs that allow user management functions to be accessed program-
matically. Implemented in Java, these APIs can be used to interface with other user
management systems including ERP/HR systems and third-party administration tools.
It can also be used to develop meta-tools allowing organizations to manage several
infrastructure components, including the GetAccess server, from a single interface.
Similarly, the APIs can also be used to accept real-time or batch updates from external
systems.
There will always be scenarios where business requirements mandate modiﬁcations to
some aspect of the behavior of the system. The GetAccess system has a variety of inter-
faces, called events that occur at deﬁned points. Examples of events include successful
log in, failed log in, password reset, etc. Developers or systems integrators can then
create customized behavior by attaching extensions to the appropriate events. Exten-
sions are compiled Java codes that extend core GetAccess functionality and allow a
deployment to meet its functionality requirements.

174
Wireless support
GetAccess provides Mobile Access capabilities with the delivery of the GetAccess
Mobile Server. The Mobile Server plugs into the GetAccess environments and allows
users to access the same applications and services that they can do with a browser, but
by using wireless devices such as PDAs and mobile phones.
Architecture
The GetAccess architecture is designed to ﬁt into traditional multi-tier enterprise appli-
cation architecture. The appropriate services can be located across various hardware
and software platforms of the DMZ and the Intranet tier as shown in ﬁgure 6.19.
Access service
It drives the user interface for log in, log out, account management, resource menu, and
self-registration capabilities. The various servlets then interact with back-end compo-
nents to provide the desired functionality. The Access Service is a client of the Authen-
tication and Authorization Routing Service (AARS), Session Management Service
(SMS), and Registry Service. It is accessed via HTTP or HTTPS by the end-user’s
browser.
The Identiﬁcation and Authorization Service and Pluggable 
Authentication and Authorization Modules (PAAMs)
The GetAccess architectural framework allows the insertion of modular identiﬁcation
and authorization services speciﬁc to a particular authentication method into the overall
Figure 6.19 Entrust GetAccess enterprise SSO solution 

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
175
architecture. These modules, called PAAMs, contain all the speciﬁc functionality for a
particular type of authentication. This abstraction allows the rest of the GetAccess
infrastructure to be deployed without needing speciﬁc knowledge of the internals of
any particular PAAM. PAAMs have been developed by customers, third-party vendors
for various authentication mechanisms and technologies.
PAAMs are called by the GetAccess Authentication and Authorization Routing Service
depending on the authentication method the user is requesting. 
Authentication and Authorization Routing Service (AARS)
The AARS plays several roles in the GetAccess infrastructure. It is responsible for
accepting authentication requests during enrollment or log in, and forwarding them on
to the appropriate PAAM for validation. If the authentication is successful, the AARS
then communicates with the GetAccess SMS in order to have a new session generated
for that user. It is also responsible for encrypting the user’s credentials based on the
random key generated for her or him at log in time.
The AARS abstracts all authentication and authorization logic away from the rest of the
GetAccess architecture. The AARS is called by the Access Service and serves as a cli-
ent of the various PAAMs, the Registry Service, and the SMS.
Logging and Audit Service
The centralized Logging Service provides logging capabilities by allowing an adminis-
trator to deﬁne, at a component level, the desired degree of details to capture in the log
ﬁle. This feature allows deployment administrators and infrastructure managers to con-
trol the amount and types of information being gathered to manage risk and resources.
Session Management Service (SMS)
The SMS maintains a session table for all active user sessions in the systems. It is
responsible for session creation (when users are authenticated) and session tracking (as
users access various protected resources on the site).
Resource Protection Service (RPS)
The GetAccess Resource Protection Service, also referred to the GetAccess Runtime,
is deployed as a web server plug-in and is responsible for performing all access control
functions for protecting web resources. It examines each inbound web request to deter-
mine if the request is for a resource that is being protected. If the user’s roles are insuf-
ﬁcient to access the resource, the Resource Protection Service rejects the request by
redirecting the user to an Access Denied page.
Data Repository and Registry Service
While GetAccess is leveraging external directories and databases for authentication
and authorization information, it maintains its own repository for the purposes of stor-
ing data about secured resources and other system information. This repository also

6 Security focus areas
176
maintains GetAccess-speciﬁc data on users, including timeout values, failed and suc-
cessful log in attempts, etc.
Multi-Domain Service (MDS)
GetAccess software uses a model of session credential storage and retrieval to facilitate
the transfer of credentials across multiple Internet Domains. Once a user is authenti-
cated to the primary domain, he or she can access secured resources on all primary and
secondary domains without needing to re-authenticate. The state of the user’s session
will be tracked regardless of the domain he or she is in, meaning that an extended
amount of time spent in applications on Domain B will not cause him to be timed out
of Domain A. Similarly, user revocation by an administrator will also be enforced
across all domains. Finally, if the user chooses to log out of the GetAccess system, the
session will be removed from the central SMS, which means that access to any applica-
tion in any domain will be denied.
Single sign-on process
When an unidentiﬁed user ﬁrst logs into the GetAccess system, the system automati-
cally collects and veriﬁes the authentication information, entitles the user, creates a
new session, and issues encrypted cookies that will serve as the user’s credentials for
the duration of the session.
The process is as shown in ﬁgure 6.19:
Step 1: User accesses the log in page. The Access Service renders a log in page pulling
appropriate branding and other content from the appropriate HTML template. The user
presents a username/password combination to the Access Service. 
Step 2: The Access Service passes this information to the AARS for validation.
Step 3: The AARS determines that this is a request for authentication against the
employee directory (stored e.g. in Active Directory), and forwards it to the LDAP
PAAM.
Step 4: The Identiﬁcation and Authorization Service takes the request and validates it
against Active Directory. If the authentication is successful, the directory responds with
the user’s privilege information including group memberships and other user attributes.
The Identiﬁcation and Authorization Service returns the successful transaction to the
AARS. It also passes on the user’s entitlements as determined by Active Directory.
Step 5: The AARS then looks up the user’s proﬁle in the GetAccess repository. It deter-
mines if the user has any other entitlements and what the administrator-deﬁned session
limits are for that user.
Step 6: The AARS then requests the SMS for a new session. The SMS creates a session
based on the timeout values provided by the AARS and generates a random, unique
encryption key for that session. It returns this information to the AARS. 
Step 7: The AARS uses the unique key to encrypt the credentials for that session. It
packages these credentials into the response back to the Access Service.

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
177
Step 8: The Access Service issues the encrypted credentials to the user’s browser in the
form of session cookies. These cookies are never written to disk, and are destroyed if
the user closes the browser, or the user logs out of the GetAccess system.
Step 9: The user is then displayed by the RPS, the dynamic resource menu that lists
those speciﬁc applications and resources to which he or she has been granted access.
Step 10: At this point, the log in process is complete. The user has been successfully
identiﬁed and entitled. Credentials corresponding to the user’s privileges have been
issued to the browser, and the user has been presented with a tailored view of the
resources to which he or she has access now. Those applications or services may be
accessed via an application or portal server.
Comments to GetAccess
The Entrust GetAccess platform is suitable for an enterprise SSO solution. 
As an integral component of the Entrust Secure Portal Solution, GetAccess delivers the
authentication, authorization and SSO capabilities for portals with highly sensitive
information and transactions. 
GetAccess offers high ﬂexibility for integration of the SSO services in existing security
environments and provides rich authentication and authorization features. The Entrust
GetAccess SSO solution is particularly suitable if medium or high authentication
strenghts are required. The performance might be an issue in some implementations,
because the abstraction of the related authentication, authorization and management
processes results in some overhead.
6.4.6 Other SSO services
GetAccess is an enterprise SSO service, provided by Entrust, a company that has spe-
cialized and focused on security only. Its SSO service is application platform agnostic
and therefore can be integrated in most modern application platforms. There are some
other independent enterprise SSO services on the market, most worth to mention RSA
ClearTrust [6.4.12] and Netegrity Siteminder [6.4.13]. In terms of functionality, ﬂexi-
bility, pricing and market reputation these services are comparable with Entrust GetAc-
cess.
On the other hand there are the platform dependent enterprise SSO services that are
designed and optimized only for their speciﬁc application platform environment. As
examples SAP Enterprise Portal and IBM WebSphere are shortly depicted in the fol-
lowing.
SAP enterprise portal SSO
SAP Enterprise Portal provides end-to-end security to SAP applications and authenti-
cation/SSO based on user name and password or certiﬁcates. The portal server for-
wards the log on information to an external authentication mechanism. The external
mechanism checks the data and returns authenticated user ID to the portal server,
which assigns the external user name to the portal user name and issues a log on ticket.

6 Security focus areas
178
With this ticket the user has single sign-on access to all applications that are accessible
through the portal. Non-SAP applications can also use the ticket, which is digitally
signed by the portal server. They can verify the ticket using a special library provided
as part of the portal infrastructure. The Entrust GetAccess or RSA ClearTrust authenti-
cation mechanism can be integrated in the SAP Portal Server infrastructure and used as
an external authentication mechanism.
The SAP Portal Server provides role-based access control, whereby the role informa-
tion is stored in the portal content directory, which acts as a general object store for role
deﬁnition, administration, and role data for page visualization. The portal management
system assigns users to roles, roles to worksets, and worksets to iViews. 
IBM WebSphere SSO
The WebSphere Portal Server provides authentication and SSO based on user name and
password or certiﬁcates. The portal server forwards the log on information to authenti-
cation component such as WebSphere Application Server Security or web SEAL-Lite
(a component of the Policy Director) or Netegrity SiteMinder or other authentication
proxy server. The authentication proxy server can be integrated with WebSphere Appli-
cation Server through its Trust Association Interceptor APIs. This provides a secure and
uniform interface to WebSphere Portal Server. WebSphere security and the IBM
authentication proxy servers are conﬁgured to use the portal LDAP directory to authen-
ticate users. WebSphere Portal Server stores the various user informations: User ID,
passwords, credentials including tokens, CORBA credentials. These credentials are
available to portlets through a standard JAAS API, so that they can be passed to back-
end applications to achieve single sign-on.
WebSphere Portal Server provides role based access control. Administrators can deﬁne
access control lists that manage access to each portlet. By replacing the access control
system implementation, third party access control servers (such as IBM Policy Director
or Netegrity Siteminder) may be used instead of the default Portal Server implementa-
tion.
6.4.7 Summary and recommendations
While some authentication methods and technologies like passwords, tokens, Ker-
beros, Passport are widely deployed, others like Certiﬁcates/PKI, SAML or Liberty are
currently emerging. Determining when to adopt an emerging technology is a critical
decision for an enterprise. If an enterprise launches its efforts too soon, it will suffer the
painful and expensive lesson of deploying an immature technology; if it delays invest-
ment for too long, it runs the risk of being left behind by competitors that have made
the technology work to their advantage.
The recommendations given in the following are distinguished in
– general statements representing some basic recommendations regarding common
requirements and technology trends
– SSO evaluation considerations specifying roughly which SSO platform ﬁts best for
what business scenarios.

6.4 Authentication, single sign-on
179
General statements
Enterprises ﬁrst should look at the security classiﬁcations (public, private, sensitive,
strictly conﬁdential) and consider the global and local perspective for data and applica-
tions as well as the business risks in order to determine what strengths of authentication
are required. Recommendations are:
– For routine applications User ID/password will probably remain the dominant iden-
tiﬁcation/authentiﬁcation mechanism for the next years.
– Large, complex enterprises may need to adopt multiple technologies for various
required authentication strengths and various types of applications and security
domains. Such general-purpose authentication systems should support multiple
methods for determining identity, including username/encrypted password, X.509
certiﬁcates, and Kerberos.
– Medium strength authentication includes software based solutions such as software
based PKI and software access tokens with sufﬁcient strong password policies. In
the long term PKI-based solutions are most ﬂexible. 
– High strength authentication should involve smartcards plus PIN and other hard-
ware-enabled and PKI/certiﬁcate-based authentication methods including biomet-
rics and hardware access tokens.
– Where to put the bar between high and medium strength authentication depends on
the cost/risk factors involved with a particular application in a particular process
environment.
– Enterprises should consider new approaches of user authentication, particularly for
mobile business applications, e.g. RSA/Mobile or Entrust Mobile ID Server to pro-
vide SMS-based 2-factor authentication.
– As a prerequisite for efﬁcient SSO systems enterprises should organize a centralized,
policy-based management of all IT-resources.
SSO evaluation
Organizations can use Microsoft .Net Passport for B2C implementations if strong
authentication is not a must requirement and there is no need to integrate this B2C
application into the enterprises’ existing non-Passport security framework as well as to
interoperate with other authentiﬁcation schemes.
The Liberty Alliance project is designed as SSO platform for B2C, B2E and B2B
equally. However it will take several months or even longer until reliable products rep-
resenting the full functionality will be available on the market. For enterprises therefore
a long term migration path from an existing SSO platform like Entrust GetAccess or
RSA ClearTrust to the more complex federation functionality is the appropriate way –
if this functionality is required, e.g. providing partners access to Intranet resources.
The GetAccess, ClearTrust or SiteMinder SSO-platform is the right choice if enter-
prises need a general purpose identiﬁcation and authentication/SSO system providing
various medium or high authentication methods and if they need to integrate this plat-
form into an existing infrastructure with heterogeneous security components and appli-

6 Security focus areas
180
cation environments. The decision which one of these 3 to prefer should be made in the
context of the enterprises’ infrastructure and speciﬁc requirements. 
Integrated SSOs like SAP Enterprise Portal SSO or IBM WebSphere SSO are usually
the ﬁrst choice to apply in homogeneous SAP respectively IBM software environ-
ments. However integrated SSOs often have not the ﬂexibility and functional richness
compared to the above mentioned specialized SSOs. In other cases customers have het-
erogenous environments and want a unique SSO, which requires extensive integration
to different environments. Even though integrated SSOs are capable to adopt other
applications, often solutions based on independent SSO services are the better choice
in the long term.
6.5 Web services and security
It is the goal that web services technology should enable enterprises to exchange mis-
sion-critical information both internally and externally. Web services can be built with-
out signiﬁcant incremental investment in hardware or software. Enterprises deploying
these services therefore are realizing an immediate return on their investments. More-
over web services enable existing application investments to be leveraged with partners
and customers. However, web services must operate in a trusted digital environment to
reach these gains.
Web services security challenges and objectives
In many respects, the security challenges posed by web services are similar to those
presented by ﬁrst generation of web technology. The objective is the same: to create a
convenient and trusted e-business environment, where enterprises can conduct cross-
boarder communications, transactions and business processes.
The underlying challenges are the same:
– How to scale security to protect a widening set of resources against increasing points
of vulnerability?
– How to manage user identities and verify who is on the other end of a network con-
nection?
– How to exert ﬁne-grained control over user access to sensitive resources?
– How to ensure the conﬁdentiality and integrity of transactions and communications?
Providing a comprehensive model of security functions and components for web ser-
vices requires the integration of currently available processes and technologies with the
evolving security requirements of future applications. It demands unifying concepts, it
requires solutions to both technological (secure messaging) and business process (pol-
icy, risk, trust) issues, and ﬁnally, it requires coordinated efforts by platform vendors,
application developers, network and infrastructure providers, and customers.
The goal is to enable customers easily to build interoperable solutions using heteroge-
neous systems. For instance, the secure messaging model supports both public key

6.5 Web services and security
181
infrastructure (PKI) and Kerberos authentication mechanisms as particular embodi-
ments of a more-general facility and is capable of being extended to support additional
security mechanisms. Integration through the abstractions of a single security model
enables organizations to use their existing investments in security technologies while
communicating with organizations using different technologies.
At the same time, every customer and every web service has its own unique security
requirements based upon their particular business needs and operational environment.
Within workgroup settings, for instance, simplicity and ease of operations are a top
concern, while for public Internet applications the ability to withstand concerted
denial-of-service attacks is a higher priority. A successful approach to web service
security requires a set of ﬂexible, interoperable security technologies that, through pol-
icy and conﬁguration, enable a variety of secure web services scenarios [6.5.1].
6.5.1 Web services security standards and speciﬁcations
Web services security terminology
For better understanding of the web services security model some signiﬁcant terms are
explained as follows.
Security token 
is a representation of security-related information and contains a set of related claims
(assertions), e.g. X.509 certiﬁcate, Kerberos ticket, username/password, security
tokens from SIM cards or smartcards.
Signed security token
is a security token cryptographically endorsed by an issuer. 
Claim
is a statement about a subject either by the subject or by a relying party that associates
the subject with the claim. Claims can be about keys potentially used to sign or encrypt
messages. Claims can be statements the security token conveys. Claims may be used,
for example, to assert the sender’s identity or an authorized role.
Subject 
of the security token is a principal (e. g. a person, an application or a business entity)
about which the claims expressed in the security token apply. As the owner of the secu-
rity token the subject possesses information necessary to prove ownership of the secu-
rity token.
Web service endpoint policy 
Web services have complete ﬂexibility in specifying the claims they require in order to
process messages. These required claims and related information refer to the Web Ser-

6 Security focus areas
182
vice Endpoint Policy. Endpoint policies may be expressed in XML and can be used to
indicate requirements related to authentication (e. g. proof of user or group identity),
authorization (e. g. proof of certain execution capabilities), or other custom require-
ments.
Claim requirements 
can be tied to the whole message or elements of messages, to all actions of a given type
or to actions only under certain circumstances. For example, a service may require a
requester to prove authority for purchase amounts greater than a stated limit.
Intermediaries
As SOAP messages are sent from an initial requester to a service, they may be operated
by intermediaries that perform actions such as routing the message or even modifying
the message. For example, an intermediary may add headers, encrypt or decrypt pieces
of the message, or add additional security tokens. In such situations, care should be
taken so that alterations to the message do not invalidate message integrity, violate the
trust model, or destroy accountability.
Actor
is an intermediary or endpoint (as deﬁned in the SOAP speciﬁcation) which is identi-
ﬁed by a URI and which processes a SOAP message. Neither user nor client software
(e. g. browsers) are actors.
Web services security model
Web services can be accessed by sending SOAP messages to service endpoints identi-
ﬁed by URIs, requesting speciﬁc actions, and receiving SOAP message responses
(including fault indications). Within this context, the broad goal of securing web ser-
vices breaks into the subsidiary goals of providing facilities for securing the integrity
and conﬁdentiality of the messages and for ensuring that the service acts only on
requests that express the claims required by policies (authentication and authorization).
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) along with the de facto Transport Layer Security (TLS) is
used to provide transport level security for web services applications. SSL/TLS offers
several security features including authentication, data integrity and data conﬁdential-
ity. SSL/TLS enables point-to-point secure sessions.
IPSec is another network layer standard for transport security that may become impor-
tant for web services. Like SSL/TLS, IPsec also provides secure sessions with host
authentication, data integrity and data conﬁdentiality.
Today’s web service application topologies include a broad combination of mobile
devices, gateways, proxies, load balancers, demilitarized zones (DMZs), outsourced
data centers, and globally distributed, dynamically conﬁgured systems. All of these
systems rely on the ability for message processing intermediaries to forward messages.
Speciﬁcally, the SOAP message model operates on logical endpoints that abstract the

6.5 Web services and security
183
physical network and application infrastructure and therefore frequently incorporates a
multi-hop topology with intermediate actors.
When data is received and forwarded by an intermediary beyond the transport layer
both the integrity of data and any security information that ﬂows with it may be lost.
This forces any upstream message processors to rely on the security evaluations made
by previous intermediaries and to trust completely their handling of the content of mes-
sages. What is needed in a comprehensive web service security architecture is a mech-
anism that provides end-to-end security. Successful web service security solutions will
be able to leverage both transport and application layer security mechanisms to provide
a comprehensive suite of security capabilities.
The following web services security model demonstrates how these goals can be
achieved:
– A web service can require that an incoming message proves a set of claims (e.g.
name, key, permission, capability, etc.). If a message arrives without having the
required claims, the service may ignore or reject the message. The required claims
and related information are referred as policy.
– A requester may also be a web service, which can send messages with proof of the
required claims by associating security tokens with the messages. Thus, messages
both demand a speciﬁc action and prove that their sender has the claim to demand
the action.
– When a requester does not have the required claims, the requester or someone on its
behalf can try to obtain the necessary claims by contacting other web services. These
other web services, referred as security token services, may in turn require their own
set of claims. Security token services broker trust between different trust domains by
issuing security tokens.
– This model is illustrated in ﬁgure 6.20, showing that any requester may also be a
service, and that the Security Token Service may also fully be a web service, includ-
ing expressing policy and requiring security tokens.
Typical message ﬂow:
Step 1: Requester (web services client) sends request for token to security token ser-
vice.
Step 2: Security token service sends back the requested token.
Step 3: Web services client adds token to SOAP message.
Step 4: Web services client signs and sends message to web service.
Step 5: Validation of client’s token by security token service.
Step 6: Web service sends response to web services client.
The security token service might be Kerberos, PKI, or a username/password validation
service. Indeed, a Kerberos service ticket granting service might be accessed through
the Kerberos protocols using operating system security functions. Once the client (web
service client) gets the tokens it wants to use in the message, the client will embed

6 Security focus areas
184
those tokens within the message. The client should sign the message with a piece of
data that only she or he knows. 
The server (web service) will be able to deduce the signature in a number of ways. If
the client is using a Username type token for authentication, the client should send a
hashed password and sign the message using that password. The server will be able to
verify that the client sent the message if the signatures it generates for the message
match the signatures contained in the message. When using X.509 certiﬁcates, the mes-
sage can be signed using the private key. The message should contain the certiﬁcate in
a certiﬁcate-type token. When using X.509, anyone who knows the X.509 public key
can verify the signature. Finally, when using a Kerberos-ticket, the message could be
signed or encrypted with a session key embedded in the Kerberos ticket. Because the
Kerberos ticket will be encrypted with the key of the receiver, only the receiver will be
able to decrypt the ticket, discover the session key, and verify the signature.
This general messaging model subsumes and supports several more speciﬁc models
such as identity-based-security, access control lists, and capabilities-based-security. It
allows use of existing technologies such as X.509 public-key certiﬁcates, Kerberos
shared-secret tickets and even password digests. It also provides an integrating abstrac-
tion allowing the system to build a bridge between different security techniques. The
general model is sufﬁcient to construct higher-level key exchange, authentication,
authorization, auditing, and trust mechanisms.
XML related security standards 
The web services standardisation will be pushed ahead by software vendors (mainly
IBM, Microsoft) and standardization organizations such as W3C, WS-I, OASIS,
UDDI.org [6.5.2].
Figure 6.20 Web services Security model

6.5 Web services and security
185
Like XML is a major enabler of web services, XML security is the basis of the web
services security standards. Developed mainly by W3C and industry consortia, XML
security today consists of:
XML Signature 
deﬁnes an XML scheme for cryptographically authenticating data. The authenticated
data may consist of a complete document, individual elements in an XML document,
or an external data object referenced by an XML document.
XML Encryption 
deﬁnes an XML scheme for encrypting data. The encrypted data may consist of a com-
plete XML document, individual elements in an XML document, or an external data
object referenced by an XML document.
XML Key Management Speciﬁcation (XKMS) 
deﬁnes trusted web services for managing cryptographic keys, including public keys.
The speciﬁcation consists of services used by a party relying on a cryptographic key
(location and validation) and services used by the holder of a cryptographic key (regis-
tration, revocation, reissue and key recovery). An important objective of XKMS is to
shield applications from the complexity of the underlying PKI. This is accomplished
by delegating the details of digital certiﬁcate processing to a separate web service.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 
is a framework for specifying and sharing ‘trust assertions’ in XML. A trust assertion
can be any data used to determine authentication and authorization of any subject (peo-
ple, application) such as credentials, credit ratings, approved roles, and so on. SAML is
important for interoperability and is designed to support interoperable authentication
and authorization services.
XML Access Control Markup Language (XACML) 
is a language for deﬁning how policy information related to access control is expressed
and transferred. By writing rules a policy author can ﬂexibly and selectively deﬁne
which web services can exercise what access privileges for which XML documents.
Security framework and speciﬁcations
As web services may be part of cross company and cross boarder orchestrated pro-
cesses a series of Web services security speciﬁcations [6.5.3] has been worked out with
regard to message based collaboration and covering issues such as privacy, policy, trust
among partners and federations. This work was initiated by IBM and Microsoft and
supported by security specialists, such as Verisign and RSA Security. Currently these
speciﬁcations are not taken over by standardization organizations and therefore the
standard status is not yet given.
The ﬁgure 6.21 illustrates the web services security framework and speciﬁcations.

6 Security focus areas
186
This set of speciﬁcations includes a message security model (WS-Security) that pro-
vides the basis for the other speciﬁcations. Layered upon are the policy (WS-Policy),
the trust (WS-Trust) and the privacy (WS-Privacy) models. These initial speciﬁcations
provide the foundation on which secure interoperable web services across trust
domains can be established.
On top of this foundation the secure conversation (WS-Secure Conversation), the fed-
erated trust (WS-Federation) and the authorization (WS-Authorization) models expand
the deployment scenarios. 
The combinations of these security speciﬁcations will enable the interoperability of
secure web services. The following descriptions explain shortly the purposes and func-
tions of the speciﬁcied security models.
WS-Security
WS-Security provides a general-purpose mechanism for associating security tokens
with messages. No speciﬁc type of security token is required by WS-Security. It is
designed to be extensible (e.g. support multiple security token formats). For example, a
requestor might provide proof of identity and proof that they have a particular business
certiﬁcation. 
WS-Security describes extensions to SOAP messaging to provide quality of protection
through message integrity and message conﬁdentiality, and deﬁnes how to attach and
include security tokens within SOAP messages. The speciﬁcation speciﬁes binary
encoded security tokens (e.g. X.509 certiﬁcates). These mechanisms can be used inde-
pendently or in combination to accommodate a wide variety of security models and
encryption technologies.
Moreover, WS-Security describes a mechanism for encoding binary security tokens.
The speciﬁcation describes how to encode X.509 certiﬁcates and Kerberos tickets as
Figure 6.21 Web services security framework

6.5 Web services and security
187
well as how to include encrypted keys. It also includes extensibility mechanisms that
can be used to describe further the characteristics of the security tokens that are
included with a message.
WS-Policy
WS-Policy describes how senders and receivers can specify their requirements and
capabilities.
WS-Policy is fully extensible and does not place limits on the types of requirements
and capabilities that may be described; however, the speciﬁcation identiﬁes several
basic service attributes including privacy attributes, encoding formats, security token
requirements, and supported algorithms.
This speciﬁcation deﬁnes a generic SOAP policy format, which can support more than
just security policies. This speciﬁcation also deﬁnes a mechanism for attaching service
policies to SOAP messages.
WS-Trust
WS-Trust covers the model for establishing both direct and brokered trust relationships
including third parties.
The speciﬁcation describes how existing direct trust relationships may be used as the
basis for brokering trust through the creation of security token issuance services. These
security token issuance services build on WS-Security to transfer the requisite security
tokens in a manner that ensures the integrity and conﬁdentiality of those tokens.
In addition the speciﬁcation describes how several existing trust mechanisms may be
used in conjunction with this trust model.
The trust model explicitly allows for delegation and impersonation.
WS-Privacy
Organization creation, managing, and using web services will often need to state their
privacy policies and require that incoming requests make claims about the sender’s
adherence to these policies.
By using a combination of WS-Policy, WS-Security, and WS-Trust, organizations can
state and indicate conformance to stated privacy policies. This speciﬁcation describes a
model for how a privacy language may be embedded into WS-Policy description and
how WS-Security may be used to associate privacy claims with a message. Finally, this
speciﬁcation describes how WS-Trust mechanisms can be used to evaluate these pri-
vacy claims for both user preferences and organizational practice claims.
WS-Secure Conversation
WS-Secure Conversation describes how a web service can authenticate requester mes-
sages, how requesters can authenticate services, and how to establish mutually authen-
ticated security contexts.

6 Security focus areas
188
In addition the speciﬁcation describes how to establish session keys, derived keys, and
per-message keys.
The speciﬁcation also describes how a service can securely exchange context (collec-
tions of claims about security attributes and related data). In order to accomplish this,
the speciﬁcation, built upon the concepts of security token issuance and exchange
mechanisms, is deﬁned in WS-Security and WS-Trust. Using these mechanisms a ser-
vice might, for example, support security tokens using weak symmetric key technology
as well as issue stronger security tokens using non-shared (asymmetric) keys.
WS-Secure Conversation is designed to operate at the SOAP message layer so that the
messages may traverse a variety of transports and intermediaries. This does not pre-
clude its use within other messaging frameworks. In order to increase the security of
the systems, transport level security may be used in conjunction with both WS-Security
and WS-Secure Conversation across selected links.
WS-Federation
This speciﬁcation deﬁnes how to construct federated trust scenarios using the WS-
Security, WS-Policy, WS-Trust, and WS-Secure Conversation speciﬁcations. For
example it describes how to federate Kerberos and PKI infrastructures.
Moreover, a trust policy is introduced to indicate, constrain and identify the type of
trust that is being brokered.
This speciﬁcation also deﬁnes mechanisms for managing the trust relationship.
WS-Authorization
This speciﬁcation describes how access policies for a web service are speciﬁed and
managed, in particular how claims may be speciﬁed within security tokens and how
these claims are to be interpreted at the endpoint.
It is designed to be ﬂexible and extensible with respect to both authorization format and
authorization language. This enables the widest range of scenarios and ensures the
long-term viability of the security framework.
Standardization outlook
The major players in the ﬁeld of web services have shown a strong interest to cooperate
in developing security standards. They all have recognized that web services can only
gain broad acceptance with adequate mechanisms to guarantee privacy as well as con-
ﬁdentiality and integrity of transactions.
Agreements on standards probably will get much more difﬁcult as the attention turns to
more complex extensions like federated identity and trust and the compliance with
other speciﬁcations such as from Liberty Alliance.
The Liberty Alliance rolled out, end of 2003, the following phase (phase 2) of its feder-
ated identity speciﬁcations, which enables identity functions for web services and pro-
vides the foundation for the Liberty Identity Web Services Framework.

6.5 Web services and security
189
 While phase 1 was about federated identity for single sign-on as depicted in a previous
section, phase 2 at a high level is about permissions-based attribute sharing.
The web services framework from Liberty Alliance provides a way of delivering iden-
tity-based web services that can make web services more secure and private and repre-
sents a standard way to identity-enable these web services by identifying all the players
in a secure, trusted manner.
Liberty Alliance also has introduced a Services Expert Group to develop interoperable
service speciﬁcations that utilize the Liberty Identity Web Services Framework and
address the needs of speciﬁc industries, applications, and business models. These spec-
iﬁcations are called Identity Service Interface Speciﬁcations (ID-SIS). 
The standardization on the one hand must regard a high degree of freedom in order to
be ﬂexible, e.g. incorporating different security techniques, deﬁning attributes, poli-
cies, etc., on the other hand it means that many deﬁnitions about semantic contexts
have to be agreed upon in a concrete environment. 
Unfortunately WS-Federation and WS-Trust are not compliant with the Liberty Alli-
ance speciﬁcations, because Microsoft and IBM, the main promotors of the WS speci-
ﬁcations, are not members of the Liberty Alliance. As a consequence at least for some
years industry must live with different standardization approaches.
Relation to today’s security techniques
This web services security model is compatible with the existing security models for
authentication, data integrity and data conﬁdentiality in common use today. As a conse-
quence, it is possible to integrate web services-based solutions with other existing
security models:
Transport security
Existing technologies such as secure sockets (SSL/TLS) can provide simple point-to-
point integrity and conﬁdentiality for a message. The web services security model sup-
ports using these existing secure transport mechanisms in conjunction with WS-Secu-
rity (and other speciﬁcations) to provide end-to-end integrity and conﬁdentiality in par-
ticular across multiple transports, intermediaries, and transmission protocols.
PKI 
At a high level, the PKI model involves certiﬁcate authorities issuing certiﬁcates with
public asymmetric keys and authorities, which assert properties other than key owner-
ship (for example, attribute authorities). Owners of such certiﬁcates may use the asso-
ciated keys to express variety of claims, including identity. The web services security
model supports security token services issuing security tokens using public asymmetric
keys. PKI is used here in the broadest sense and does not assume any particular hierar-
chy or model.

6 Security focus areas
190
Kerberos 
The Kerberos model relies on communication with the Key Distribution Center (KDC)
to broker trust between parties by issuing symmetric keys encrypted for both parties
and introducing them to one another. The web services model has been built upon the
core model with security token services brokering trust by issuing security tokens with
encrypted symmetric keys and encrypted testaments.
Note that while the models are compatible, to ensure interoperability, adaptors and/or
common algorithms for signatures and encryption will need to be agreed upon.
Existing models for federation, authorization (including delegation), privacy and trust
are less common and more ad hoc. Speciﬁcations to address these security properties
are identiﬁed, but may be still subject of discussion.
Often the existing trust models are based on business agreements. An example of this is
the UDDI web service. In UDDI, there are several participants who provide a Universal
Business Registry through an agreement to support a set of APIs. Rather than deﬁning
a single model for trust through the requirement of a speciﬁc authentication mecha-
nism, the trust model in UDDI gives the responsibility for authentication to the node,
which is the custodian of the information. That means, each implementation of the
UDDI web service has its own authentication mechanism and enforces its own access
control policy. The trust is between operators, and between the requester and the oper-
ator that is the custodian of its information.
6.5.2 Web services security scenarios
Web services are likely to be implemented incrementally, ﬁrst within an enterprise and
then expanding outward as standards and technologies allow.
The development may be anticipated as shown in the following:
Phase one: intra-enterprise
Enterprises will initially use web services internally, mainly for EAI (Enterprise Appli-
cation Integration) and for increasing visibility and productivity of selected business
processes, e. g. delivery and payment status and process. For example, an enterprise
may integrate its web-based shipping and legacy accounts payable systems in order to
track order delivery so that it can bill in real time and predict cash ﬂow more accurately.
One of the advantages of starting internally is that it is relatively easy to ensure that
chosen technologies and standards are available, secure and compatible.
Phase two: extra-enterprise with selected partners
As web services are successfully utilized internally, enterprises will likely extend them
to partners and suppliers with which they have already negotiated agreements. Enter-
prises will transform existing applications to a web services platform to automate the
processes that implement e.g. a supply chain relationship. A supply chain management
application, for example, could utilize web services components to publish automati-

6.5 Web services and security
191
cally and execute orders, query and consolidate shipping capacity, and aggregate and
schedule production needs among various participants in the enterprise’s value chain.
During this phase, transaction protocols and security standards will become critical to
the success of web services enabled applications.
Phase three: partner communities
As the breadth of companies deploying web services grows, so will rise the potential
for more sophisticated interactions. During this phase, enterprises will likely use web
services to automate the negotiation of business agreements within a set group of part-
ners, suppliers, and customers. For example, an enterprise might post request for pro-
posals and quotes to its extended community of suppliers, receive their responses, and,
based on that information, negotiate terms dynamically. This phase is far more
dynamic than the earlier phases, performing logic that may vary over time and virtually
eliminate the need for human intervention, unless exception handling.
Phase four: dynamic collaboration
The most promising phase in the evolution of web services will improve on previous
phases by enabling not only B2B process execution and negotiation with existing part-
ners, but also the dynamic search, identiﬁcation, and involvement of new business part-
ners. Once potential partners are identiﬁed, web services-enabled applications will
negotiate the terms of the operating relationship between enterprises that may never
have worked together, execute the resulting agreements, and even enable billing and
payment for services and products. Achieving this level of service will require wide-
spread agreement on a wide range of standards, as well as global directories that enable
anonymous but reputable and legitimate participants to locate easily and reliably for
collaboration.
According to the phases mentioned previously the ﬁgure 6.22 illustrates the different
scenarios of secured web services.
The diagram shows a business process represented through a workﬂow and imple-
mented by orchestrated web services. On the one hand these web services may repre-
sent some business process objects and on the other hand provide the connections to
enterprises’ applications and resources as well as to customers and partners whenever
this is required dependent on the workﬂow.
As examples of the previously depicted phase 1, web services messages (arrows
marked with 1 in ﬁgure 6.22) are shown executed on the same application server. In
these cases web services invoke other web services, connect to a WSDL-wrapped exist-
ing standard or legacy application or provide access to a database.
As example of phase 2 and 3, selected partners and customers may also be integrated in
the workﬂow, deploying web services technology (arrows 2, 3). Though the enterprise
may have already negotiated agreements and policies with their business partners, the
security impact concerning authentication, conﬁdentiality, integrity and non repudia-
tion is much stronger as web services communicate via the Internet and http-protocol
bindings pass the ﬁrewalls without control.

6 Security focus areas
192
As mentioned in phase 4, a dynamic collaboration between partners who never before
had business relationships, might be required (arrow 4). This is indeed the most valu-
able scenario, but with regard to security and trust, it is certainly the most sophisticated
one. Trust between these partners must be achieved dynamically by standardized nego-
tiations and agreements.
6.5.3 Web services deployment example
The deployment example in this section shows the way web services security technol-
ogies can be applied in business processes. Figure 6.23 illustrates a mortgage applica-
tion process. This mortgage process has been extracted from a RSA Security White
Paper, Web Services Security [6.5.4], but the illustration is different in ﬁgure 6.23. 
The mortgage application consists of checking the user’s credit rating, the user’s access
rights to access a property database, to verify the property’s details and ﬁnally to sign a
contract.
Step 1: An applicant ﬁlls out an online mortgage application form and hits the submit
button. The web services application now begins the process.
Step 2: Before the mortgage application service can interact with other web services, it
must be able to authenticate itself to those services. This will be accomplished by pre-
senting a digital certiﬁcate that has been issued by a trusted third party. Providing an
interface to a public key management system, the XKMS server retrieves the mortgage
company’s digital certiﬁcate.
Step 3: The mortgage application service now queries a UDDI directory, asking to be
connected to any of the three nationally known credit rating ﬁrms with whom the mort-
Figure 6.22 Web services deployment phases 

6.5 Web services and security
193
gage company does business. The UDDI returns the name of one ﬁrm and indicates
that requests must be digitally signed.
Step 4: When the mortgage application service submits its signed request, the credit
bureau accesses the XKMS server to validate the requester’s PKI credentials. The
XKMS server responds that the credentials are valid. The credit bureau then answers
the mortgage company’s request with an attribute assertion stating that the applicant
has the highest credit rating.
Step 5: Having veriﬁed the applicant’s credit-worthiness, the mortgage application
service now needs to validate the details of the property in question by checking a prop-
erty data-base maintained by the appropriate government agency. Before granting
access however, the database company checks to verify that the mortgage company has
contracted to access this resource – and then returns a SAML authorization assertion.
Step 6: The mortgage application service submits a property query, with a WS-Security
header containing the authorization assertion issued in step 5. A response is returned
with the indication that the property ﬁts the description provided by the applicant and is
free and clear of legal and ﬁnancial claims.

Nevertheless the basic building blocks are offered by the major players now or will be
provided in the near future. More complex security scenarios – such as federation –
will probably raise more discussion and open issues.
The following basic building blocks are more or less available with products of the ven-
dors listed in this section below:
– Secure socket layer (SSL/TSL) for channel conﬁdentiality
– Web Services Description Language (WSDL) for integrity
– SAML for authentication and authorization
– XML-Encryption for granular document conﬁdentiality
– XML-Signature for granular integrity and non-repudiation
– Web Services Security (authentication, encryption and signature)
– XKMS (key management)
– XACML (access control)
Companies are expected to announce more detailed web services security roadmaps as
standards evolve. The features, known so far, are described below.
Microsoft .NET 
Microsoft has implemented SSL and XML security as foundations of the .NET Frame-
work.
In addition Microsoft currently is developing a set of technologies code-named Trust-
Bridge, [6.5.5] which embrace WS-Security and other WS standards, and enable appli-
cations to use credentials created on a wide range of systems, including Active Direc-
tory, Microsoft .NET Passport, and other products that support WS-Security (for exam-
ple, IBM WebSphere products). 
TrustBridge will be able to federate with other enterprise or Internet-based authentica-
tion systems using the WS-Security approach. This will enable enterprises, which have
chosen to interoperate with the Passport system, to allow their users signing in with
their existing credentials at Passport-participating sites.
Microsoft development tools and the .NET Framework provide basic support for the
WS-Security and will add further support for these new interoperability standards so
that developers can build applications that use WS-Security and related speciﬁcations
from the WS-Security roadmap.
IBM Tivoli
The actual version of the WebSphere Application Server offers web services features
that include a UDDI service, a Web Services Gateway (which addresses web services
communication capabilities issues through Service Mapping, Import and Export Map-
ping, Transformation, and UDDI publication and lookup features), and an implementa-
tion of the WS-Security speciﬁcation that includes digital signature support and iden-
tity propagation capability [6.5.6].

6.5 Web services and security

Tivoli Access Manager (TAM, [6.5.7]) offers the new web services federated identity
management interfaces that enable customers to plug in support for identity standards,
including out-of-the box support for the XML Key Management Speciﬁcation
(XKMS).
In addition to an implementation of the WS-Security speciﬁcation, Tivoli extends
Access Manager’s federated identity management interface support to include addi-
tional advanced federated capabilities. Web Services Trust Proxy, Trust Broker and
Security Token Service, new components of the Tivoli Access Manager, will offer trust
brokering with external trust providers, such as Microsoft’s Windows based Trust-
Bridge federation technology, allowing companies to automate the process of entering
into trusted business relationships. IBM plans to support a broad range of brokering
methods, such as Microsoft TrustBridge, Kerberos tokens, Public Key Infrastructure
credentials, SAML and other means of delegated trust that develop in the future.
Additionally, Tivoli Access Manager will implement cross-enterprise, federated iden-
tity management that includes validating and asserting cross-enterprise credentials,
generating cross-enterprise federated identity tokens, such as Kerberos tokens, SAML,
PKI and securely linking or mapping external identities to internal identity deﬁnitions.
Added capabilities will consist of an Identity and Credential Mapping service, for han-
dling identity translations between companies, and an Identity Proﬁle Service, for man-
aging attribute proﬁles of users from trusted organization within the federation. Tivoli
also plans to provide ﬁne-grained authorization for SOAP transactions in web services
environments. This new feature will allow businesses to control access to web services
applications based on a user’s identity and associated roles and entitlements.
SAP NetWeaver
With reference to SAP’s White Paper Security: Secure Business in Open Environments
[6.5.8], the security infrastructure of mySAP Technology delivers security features for
heterogeneous business environments. That means it protects business transactions and
information within applications from unauthorized use by addressing the key security
issues of authentication, authorization, privacy, non-repudiation and integrity:
– User administration with a uniﬁed user store enables to manage user roles and autho-
rizations.
– Secure system management includes authentication and encryption mechanisms.
– Digital signatures provide security and non-repudiation on the application level by
attaching trust information to the data itself.
– Trust relationship management offers authentication, single sign-on, and imperson-
ation mechanisms, as well as integration of public key infrastructures.
– An audit framework enables to perform detailed checks on existing security mecha-
nisms to ensure the integrity of business transactions. 
It is on SAP’s roadmap to offer a WS-security compliant framework as part of the Web
Application Server (WAS) of the Netweaver platform.

Entrust Secure Transaction Platform
The Entrust Secure Transaction Platform [6.5.9] is a new security framework for deﬁn-
ing how to integrate foundation security services into web services applications. This
platform will allow integrating and deploying security services that add identiﬁcation,
privacy, entitlements and veriﬁcation to make web services transactions trusted trans-
actions.
The identiﬁcation service enables organizations to control centrally, which identities
are trusted for automated web services transactions so that each web services applica-
tion does not have to manage these issues independently.
The entitlement service provides the centralized administration of access entitlements
as well as interfaces that allow applications to check those entitlements.
The veriﬁcation service conﬁrms the integrity and accountability of transactions
through centralized digital signature and timestamping services.
The privacy service encrypts information so that only designated entities can access
that information.
Entrust provides four methods of integrating security into web services applications:
– The Security toolkit integration is the traditional method; developers include the
security functionality directly into their applications.
– The Direct Integration allows web services applications to call out directly to the
foundation security services delivered by the Entrust Secure Transaction Platform.
This platform offers web services interfaces to application developers.
– The SOAP Firewall Integration provides a method to deliver transparent security.
SOAP Firewalls sit in the ﬂow of information on a network. They look for speciﬁc
application-level messages and transform those messages as they pass by through
the ﬁrewall. The SOAP Firewall can perform a variety of security actions on behalf
of the application.
– The application server plug-in integration is a similar concept to that of the SOAP
Firewall. It provides security on behalf of web services, however runs directly on the
application server that also executes the business logic of the web services applica-
tion.
6.5.5 Summary and recommendations
Enterprises that consider a web services implementation need to make security an inte-
gral part of their IT-strategy and planning efforts. One way to reduce the risk and com-
plexity of deploying this new technology is to start with an application that can be
secured easily using existing capabilities. This is mostly the case with intra-enterprise
applications, i.e. web services deployment across the enterprise perimeter (phase 1 in
section 6.5.2). Even with selected partners conventional security mechanisms can be
deployed, for example, point-to-point interactions between two companies can be
authenticated and protected using VPN or SSL sessions (phase 2).

6.5 Web services and security
197
Web services will be a de facto standard for application deployment and particularly
for application integration. Therefore it is important that enterprises move to under-
stand this technology. Application integration today often managed by point-to-point
spaghetti connections will successively be replaced by hub- and spoke-technologies
and especially deploying web services.
Ad hoc business process implementations will become essential and help companies to
stay competitive being able to react fast to changing market conditions and require-
ments. More complex, multi-partner web services deployment (phase 3 and 4) should
be approached cautiously. It will require large-scale commitments of resources to secu-
rity techniques, including PKI. On the other hand, companies that already have imple-
mented PKI should be encouraged to use the embedded mechanism to implement even
more complex web services deployments. 
It can be assumed that companies that have decided web services deployment strategi-
cally will need PKI sooner or later, while companies with existing PKI environment are
in a better position to deploy enhanced web services soon.

7 Outlook
The development of our society and economy is determined by ethical and social
issues, by the desires of individuals, by economic and business needs, by political, legal
and regulatory issues and, ﬁnally, by the evolution of technologies.
Analysts regularly study these developments and their impact, with the result that a
variety of future scenarios are drawn up and published nearly every month. 
The author does not have the intention either of commenting on these predictions or of
describing any other view of the future. Instead, some of the main trends in the ﬁeld of
information and communication technology will be considered in the light of their rela-
tionship with the issues addressed in this book. These are namely Mobility, Web Ser-
vices and Security.
7.1 Trends in information and communication technology
In terms of the way future business solutions will evolve and gain widespread accep-
tance, four trends in the information and communication ﬁeld are of crucial signiﬁ-
cance:
– Convergence of networks
– Virtualization of services
– Always-on society
– Intuitive user experience
Convergence of networks
The ability to digitize any content, such as text, data, voice, graphics, photos, video or
multimedia, is a crucial prerequisite if networks are to converge to form a worldwide IP
network. Technologies such as voice over IP and the implementation of the IP protocol
stacks within various access technologies, as shown in ﬁgure 7.1, will enable this con-
vergence to progress gradually.
Convergence is signiﬁcant for carrier backbone and access networks (wireline and
wireless) as well as enterprise networks. In enterprise networks, even the next genera-
tion of PBX will be IP-enabled. 

7.1 Trends in information and communication technology
199
This convergence is the only answer to the problem of increasing network complexity
and is driven mainly by the cost reductions it promises and the advantage of seamless
communication. 
The unifying transport layer is the Internet. The integration of real-time communica-
tion with IT applications will drive the replacement of circuit-switched architectures by
packet-switched IP switches and routers. Real-time SIP (Session Initiative Protocol)
will play a key role in assuring seamless voice communication in wireless and wireline
IP networks. During the transitional phase, gateways will transform the traditional pro-
tocols. Reliability and quality of service issues may arise but should be solved by 2007. 
VPN services will become still more important. These provide ﬂexible access to enter-
prises and make it possible to set up virtual and secure communication paths within an
all-embracing, open network.
Mobile devices will support the IP protocol stack and IP proxies will complement WAP
gateways. In addition, enhanced mobile technologies will make it possible to develop
more intelligent mobile devices that provide new services representing considerable
consumer value.
Moreover, converged networks will also foster peer-to-peer communication that will
also be employed in many business applications, such as distributed processing, dis-
tributed storage services or decentralized collaboration.
Virtualization of services
The need for mobility and globalization, increased cost pressures and competition, as
well as the emergence of new technologies will increasingly force enterprises to virtu-

alize their organizations and services. If they are to adapt quickly and ﬂexibly to new
market requirements, companies must concentrate on their core competencies. There is
a tendency to organize other activities within virtualized environments.
Models such as outsourcing and offshoring form part of this trend and are successfully
exploited today. However, in the long term, technologies such as web services, grid
services, service-oriented architectures, software agents and the business-on-demand
paradigm will drive the virtualization of services to a new level that will result in major
changes to today’s business solutions.
Today’s standard packages will become modularized and more specialized and new
competitors will arise offering best of breed services. The concept of a purely linear
value chain will be replaced by more complex networks of services.
Future business solutions will be characterized by dynamic, ongoing changes in the
interactions between partners and customers. Semantic web services will bring about
plug & play service modules and automated service creation. The virtualization and
outsourcing of services as well as business process outsourcing will become the norm
for every enterprise. Thanks to these changes, companies will gain the ﬂexibility that
will allow them to react in real time, trim supply chains and inventories, improve cus-
tomer satisfaction and avoid unpleasant surprises.
Always-on society
The term always-on or connected society was created by Gartner to refer to the predic-
tion that more than 75% of EU and US citizens will have the option of immediate
access to e-services for over 80 percent of their nonworking time by 2007. The always-
on society will evolve as a consequence of widespread, easy access to sufﬁcient wire-
less network bandwidth coupled with the availability of mobile devices capable of
exploiting this bandwidth at affordable network fees.
The trend towards mobility will become an integral part of society, inﬂuencing the
actions and attitudes of the majority of citizens. Widely accepted applications such as
instant messaging, location-based and context-aware services as well as electronic pay-
ment or ticketing based on mobile phone accounts will drive this trend. 
Furthermore, in the always-on world, a mobile device will become a personal compan-
ion in a variety of leisure situations, such as communication, entertainment, informa-
tion, traveling and learning. 
Personal mobile devices will increase in processing power, while their networking
capabilities and battery capacity will also improve. As a result, personal devices will
evolve to become advanced personal application platforms. The combination of com-
puting and networking will allow the development of autonomous peer-to-peer applica-
tions. Such applications will be deployed in numerous ﬁelds, such as messaging,
games, communities, dating and media piracy. 
As far as business solutions are concerned, the always-on society implies a redeﬁnition
of the concepts of work and leisure. Such a society will reinforce the tendency to move
from ﬁxed time to anytime and from ﬁxed place to anywhere working scenarios. Net-

7.2 Relationship with mobility, web services and security

working and computing capabilities will mean that there is no longer any clear divide
between the leisure and working worlds. However, this development will bring about
new challenges for enterprises: increased security requirements, more event-driven
working style, more dynamic and ﬂexible tasks and team creation.
Intuitive user experiences
Devices, networks, and applications have all grown in complexity over recent years.
Users are close to the point at which they will reject new developments which fail to
offer simplicity of use. It is therefore generally accepted that user experiences must be
improved signiﬁcantly by means of smarter devices and applications and through the
deployment of innovative human interface technologies. Personalized, intuitive, learn-
ing interfaces must adapt to the user’s needs, the current situation, the requested ser-
vices and applications. The individualization of content and services must increasingly
meet the user’s personal preferences.
The result will be the development of smart applications that are aware of the user’s
context and take account of his or her proﬁle, preferences, working processes and
workﬂows or leisure situations, the current location, the communication device and
capabilities. These applications may even recognize the user’s habits and emotions.
Multimodal interfaces will add speech, pen and handwriting recognition to the tradi-
tional pointer and keyboard interfaces. New concepts for vision and touch-based inter-
action will emerge. Multimodality will allow users to use multiple input and output
modes in an intuitive way. For example it will be possible to combine voice commands,
predictive text input, keypad use and graphics in the same interaction. In some sce-
narios, a range of sensors may permit context-sensitive interaction with the environ-
ment, taking account, for example, of light, noise, or movement conditions, wellness,
etc.
The user’s experience is undoubtedly a key focus of attention for future-oriented busi-
ness solutions and is crucial for the acceptance of innovative technologies and applica-
tions. 
7.2 Relationship with mobility, web services and security
It is a remarkable fact, and one which may be unique in the history of IT, that all of the
major software vendors (middleware and applications) have joined together in support-
ing a new architecture (SOA) and technology (web services). Furthermore, all of the
vendors are currently boosting their efforts to signiﬁcantly enhance the mobility and
security features of their platforms.
Web services 
As far as web services are concerned, it is worth noting that the market leaders (IBM,
Microsoft, SAP) are obviously intensifying their cooperative efforts. They will proba-

7 Outlook
202
bly pursue this avenue of development, both in their own interests and in the context of
their customers’ requirements. This will also strengthen the positions of the three mar-
ket leaders and will place their competitors in a difﬁcult position.
At the same time, SOA will undoubtedly provide impetus in the market for innovative
solutions and services and this will create new opportunities for niche players offering
highly specialized or innovative services. This means increasing competition for SAP,
Microsoft and other standard software vendors, while simultaneously giving SAP the
opportunity to offer its own modularized software modules, packaged as web services
that can be used regardless of the underlying platform.
As far as the enterprise is concerned, a web service is a virtual service. Its functions are
deﬁned by the WSDL descriptions. The requester of a web service has no need to know
the programming model chosen to implement the service. 
Multiple service providers may offer identical functionality in their web services,
which, however, may differ in terms of their operational suitability, e.g. whether they
can meet deﬁned business policies, such as the requirement that all data to be
exchanged has to be encrypted. Consequently, the use of a service-oriented architecture
demands an infrastructure which identiﬁes the most suitable web service in terms of the
technical and business-related aspects that are relevant to the requester. This infrastruc-
ture, which is called the service bus, is currently the subject of discussion by experts
and will be of crucial importance for the virtualization of services.
This and today’s other debated but as yet unresolved web services issues, such as secu-
rity, federation, distributed transactions, business process languages and accounting,
should be solvable at the technical level by 2006 at the latest. However, the software
vendors, standards organizations and industry consortia may have different perspec-
tives and pursue divergent interests – the different approaches to federation and trust
standards proposed by WS-I and the Liberty Alliance being only one example here. It
is difﬁcult to predict how these disagreements may hinder the deployment and diffu-
sion of web service based business solutions.
However the changes that will arrive in the near future will be signiﬁcant and enter-
prises need to keep a careful eye on developments in the light of their own speciﬁc sit-
uations. It seems that the time window available to make the appropriate architectural
and technological decisions will be limited.
IT service providers will also have to realign their portfolios. Enterprises require con-
sulting services in order to decide how to deal with web services (particularly external
web services) and need to deﬁne a web services strategy. It is also clear that solution
architects who are able to help enterprises migrate towards forward-looking, service-
oriented architectures will be in great demand. Furthermore, IT service providers will
be in a position to create new business opportunities by providing trusted web services.
In this role, they will act as trusted mediators by offering selected business processes
based on web services. 

7.2 Relationship with mobility, web services and security
203
Mobility
Mobility is a megatrend and enterprises will sooner or later face the challenges of
mobile business solutions. When planning and implementing secure mobile solutions,
two key aspects should be borne in mind. 
First, mobile solutions should be based on proven, standards-oriented infrastructures
and easily integrable, modular building blocks that enable step-by-step implementa-
tions. Reusable web services integrated in enterprises’ portal architectures are the best
way to achieve economic targets while also securing the agility and ﬂexibility that are
required in order to stay competitive. Centralized applications using browser clients are
easy to manage and often the most promising solution. However, intelligent mobile cli-
ents offer more ﬂexibility and may therefore predominate in the long term. This may
also come about as a result of the second aspect that needs to be mentioned here. 
This second aspect concerns the always-on society and its implications for the concepts
of leisure and work. The strict separation of leisure and work will disappear in an
always-on society. This fact will have consequences for mobile device capabilities, as
well as for applications and platforms. 
Users will have access to both the network operator’s portal and the enterprise portal
and will also be able to connect directly to web services via the Internet. A possible
conﬁguration is shown in ﬁgure 7.2. 
The diagram depicts the variety of applications that users may choose depending on
their leisure activities and business tasks. The kind of device illustrated here will typi-
cally be used by mobile knowledge workers. It offers the functional integration of a
variety of applications. Some application areas may be relevant for both business and
leisure, such as payment, location-based services, MMS, e-learning, etc.
Figure 7.2 Leisure and work platforms 

7 Outlook
204
From the individual user’s perspective, it is possible to distinguish between four differ-
ent ways of beneﬁting from network services: access to the enterprise portal, access to
the network operator’s portal, direct access to third-party web services or web services
provided by trusted mediators and, ﬁnally, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication and
services. 
The greater the volume of available data services or services with digitized content, the
closer the architectures of enterprises’ and network operators’ platforms will grow and
the greater the extent of service overlap will be. Whatever the source, service-oriented
architectures will evolve and make it possible to offer both home-grown and third-party
web services.
The consequence of this will be keener competition in the ﬁeld of service-oriented
application platforms. For example, horizontal services, such as location-based, push,
MMS, PIM, and PKI/authentication services could be offered by network operators on
behalf of enterprises, at least in the case of SMBs. On the other hand, independent IT
service providers, which play the role of trusted mediators providing best-of-breed web
services, could offer these services to enterprises and even compete with the network
operators by offering enhanced services to their subscribers.
These areas of competition will drive the widespread deployment of web services and
service-oriented architectures, provided that this is not blocked by other inﬂuences,
such as regulatory requirements or disagreements concerning standardization. 
Intelligent mobile devices provide the prerequisite for P2P computing. By avoiding
centralized overhead, P2P might also become a valuable application model for busi-
ness. However, we currently lack the relevant experience in this ﬁeld. Instant messag-
ing, data exchange and distribution, and alerts/notiﬁcations could act as example appli-
cations.
Security
In an always-on world comprising mobile access to enterprise resources, network oper-
ators’ services and third-party web services, the triple A challenge (Authentication,
Authorization and Accounting) will take on a new dimension. 
On the one hand, VPNs play an essential role by providing secure channels for business
applications. On the other, however, password access methods neither provide the
required security level nor are easy to handle when access to a dozen or more resources
may be required. A reliable PKI environment offering a single sign-on facility seems to
be the only reasonable answer, at least in the case of corporate applications requiring
Intranet access.
Conﬁdential information such as private keys is best stored in tamper-resistant mod-
ules. Smartcards and SIM cards are both based on a tamper-resistant chip technology
that integrates hardware and software protection measures and offers a very high secu-
rity level. Moreover, these media are state of the art, portable, standardized and inter-
changeable across different devices. This means that users can carry their private keys
with them in the same way as a credit card and use them in different devices.

7.2 Relationship with mobility, web services and security
205
As described in chapter 6, the smartcard is a multifunctional security tool for a whole
range of enterprise security applications, e.g. for building admission control, user
authentication and authorization for network and application access, and digital signa-
tures for signing e-mails or as proof of origin for electronic documents. These com-
bined capabilities make the smartcard an ideal electronic identity tool, for example in
the form of employee or citizen cards that comprise a multitude of different applica-
tions.
Meanwhile, SIM cards, which are based on the same processor technology and ISO
standard (7816), are currently used primarily as tokens to authenticate subscribers to
their network operators. However, the WAP standard 1.2/2.0 has introduced the Wire-
less Identiﬁcation Module (WIM). WIM provides a dedicated speciﬁcation for users’
security tokens which includes private keys and user certiﬁcates as well as crypto-
graphic functions. 
WIM itself is deﬁned as a smartcard application and can either be accommodated in
software form on the network operator’s SIM card or be implemented as a separate
card, the WIM card (with a SIM form factor), which can also be issued by a non-carrier
service provider or by an enterprise. In the latter case, the WIM card may be used in a
second SIM-type slot provided on some mobile devices. In UMTS networks, the SIM
card will be replaced by a Universal SIM card (USIM) which is both upwardly compat-
ible and even offers additional security features based on the latest chipcard processor
technology (e.g on-chip crypto-controller capable of generating private keys inside the
chip). 
With reference to the leisure and work conﬁgurations illustrated in ﬁgure 7.2, the com-
bined deployment of smartcard and USIM/SIM/WIM technology in business scenar-
ios with high security requirements will constitute a forward-looking solution. 
This type of security solution is presented in ﬁgure 7.3.
The solution requires the enterprise to possess an underlying PKI infrastructure. Enter-
prises with multi-channel (wireline and wireless) business provisioning strategies will
be forced to harmonize their wireline and wireless security architectures in order to
protect their investment through future-proof designs. In particular, separate security
infrastructures for web and WAP should be avoided as these will increase costs and
reduce economies of scale.
Figure 7.3 illustrates just such a harmonized security architecture, providing authenti-
cation, integrity and non-repudiation based on certiﬁcates and digital signatures with
web and current WAP/SIM or future IP/USIM technology.
In a personalization process compliant with the PKI standard, employees’ private keys
and certiﬁcates are to be stored in the smartcard’s ﬁle system as well as in the appropri-
ate WIM area. Either the enterprise or a network operator or another trusted service
provider generates keys as well as trust center/certiﬁcation authority certiﬁcates and
distributes the private keys and certiﬁcates to the hardware tokens (smartcard, WIM)
and the public key to directories. Responsibility for personalization depends on
whether WIM is implemented as an application on the SIM card (carrier’s responsibil-

7 Outlook
206
ity), whether the enterprise takes responsibility itself or prefers to outsource this task to
a specialized, trusted service provider.
In most cases, users are assigned different private keys for authentication and encryp-
tion. In advanced security solutions, the authentication key is generated directly on the
smartcard/USIM by the users themselves and then initiated via their PCs once they
have been registered by a local registration authority. The encryption key, which is gen-
erated and administrated by a trust center, can then be securely downloaded to the
smartcard/USIM. This type of advanced solution will bring about a further signiﬁcant
reduction in administrative effort.
From the user’s perspective, this chipcard-based solution obviates the need to use doz-
ens of passwords and different procedures for authentication, digital signatures, etc.
From the enterprise’s point of view, it is ultimately, despite the need to invest in a PKI
infrastructure, a cost-saving solution that offers a high level of security for a variety of
mobile devices in a world in which these can be expected to be used for both leisure
and business purposes.
The Universal Personal Communication Module 
As a ﬁnal thought with regard to the medium-term future, the author would like to
spend some time considering the idea of the Universal Personal Communication Mod-
ule (UPCM).
As discussed in chapter 4, the divergence of wireless devices will increase. Many more
intelligent smartphones, PDAs, laptops, tablet PCs, portable TVs, etc. will penetrate
the market. GPRS/UMTS, WLAN and Bluetooth networks are complementary tech-
nologies that will co-exist throughout the next decade. New business and leisure appli-
Figure 7.3 Smartcard and SIM card based security

7.2 Relationship with mobility, web services and security
207
cation scenarios will emerge. Personalization will be a key factor in permitting the fast
and simple use of these applications. Identiﬁcation, authentication and, in some cases,
digital signatures and encryption will become mandatory in order to make use of any
service. This will demand the provision of the appropriate attributes, keys and certiﬁ-
cates, which users will want to carry with them in the same way as credit cards and
which they will want to be able to employ regardless of the type of device they happen
to be using.
Considering these aspects (device and network independence, security and personal-
ization) and given the continuing miniaturization of memory, processor and communi-
cation chips, the fascinating idea of a new communication module becomes conceiv-
able: the UPCM.
This UPCM would combine security and network technologies coupled with PIM and
additional personal attributes and ﬁles in a single module. As ﬁgure 7.4 illustrates, it
could be plugged into any device via a standardized interface, for example via the CF
card port. When the card is inserted, the device operating system would automatically
recognize the UPCM and perform the necessary conﬁguration and activation opera-
tions. Optionally, the UPCM might be equipped with a ﬁngerprint sensor meaning that
it could only be activated by the authorized UPCM owner’s ﬁnger press.
Before this idea can become a reality, device manufacturers and network operators
must agree upon a UPCM standard which, though it might not be very different to the
USIM standard, would also have to specify a standardized device interface and agree
on selected communication interfaces and standards (GPRS, UMTS, Bluetooth,
WLAN 802.11 a, b, g, i, etc.).
Such a UPCM could be offered by device manufacturers or network operators. The
SIM/USIM functionality could either be integrated or a separate card could be inserted
in the UPCM.
As shown in ﬁgure 7.4, the proposed UPCM architecture resembles that of modern
chipcards, comprising CPU, RAM, ROM, EEPROM/Flash, and crypto-controller. It
will be tamper-resistant to permit the storage of various keys and certiﬁcates and will
be equipped with PIM software which can be synchronized with the user’s PC. It will
also contain the standardized device interface as well as the integrated GPRS/UMTS,
Bluetooth and WLAN communication modules.
The UPCM clearly offers a number of advantages compared with today’s communica-
tion and security components:
– A single component comprising both security and communication functionality that
can be used in conjunction with all types of mobile devices (laptops, tablet PCs,
PDAs, smartphones) to replace today’s multiple pluggable security and communica-
tion components which often differ between device classes.
– Regardless of the mobile device and the current network environment, the user can
conveniently connect to any network or network resource thanks to the integrated,
certiﬁcate-based authentication methods. 

7 Outlook
208
– Regardless of the employed mobile device, users’ personal data (PIM) and ﬁles are
available locally on the UPCM. Users’ personal attributes are also stored since these
may be relevant for online or ofﬂine applications.
– Users always carry their UPCM (CF card size) with them and can use it in any other
device provided it has a UPCM interface. 
– The UPCM is tamper-resistant, i.e. the over-the-air downloading of keys, applica-
tions and data is secure. This provides considerable ﬂexibility in terms of the use of
different service providers and applications as well as in terms of the capability of
the currently used device.
– Enterprises reduce costs because they have to purchase, personalize and administer
only one instead of a number of different security and communication components.
– Device manufacturers will be in a position to design cheaper devices without equip-
ping each device with security and communication components. The design of
device and security/communication technologies can be decoupled, thus accelerat-
ing development. 
It will be exciting to see how industry responds to the increasing security and commu-
nication challenges and whether it will be possible to standardize modules such as the
UPCM.
7.3 Summary and conclusion
Recently, research conducted by Gartner has revealed that security is the number one
IT-related issue worrying CIOs, ahead of EAI/middleware, messaging and portals, and
that it will remain the key issue up until 2006. At the same time, web services, the num-
ber 5 technology issue in 2003, will climb to second position in 2006.

7.3 Summary and conclusion
209
Increasingly, information is becoming an organization’s most important asset. It does
not matter what form it takes. However the information is stored, transmitted or pro-
cessed, the need for protection is of paramount importance in order to provide business
continuity and minimize any potential damage. Security as a horizontal technology is
embedded in every component of e-business solutions and is only as reliable as its
weakest link. Both mobile applications and the deployment of web services will usher
in the development of a new range of crucial security challenges.
Web services and service-oriented architectures constitute a new paradigm for IT-based
business support. This will bring about signiﬁcant change, greater competition and
accelerated application development. It will also confront IT managers with the ques-
tion of how to deal with these changes. In addition, the web services model creates a
kind of two-level programmability which in turn offers greater ﬂexibility in designing
and changing business processes. Enterprises and IT service providers will therefore
have to redeﬁne their business relationships and responsibilities.
The mobility megatrend will permanently inﬂuence both social life and business activ-
ities. According to Meta Group, application mobilization will become a key enterprise
challenge and develop into the greatest consumer of resources and business effort.
Unfortunately, organizations often do not adopt the correct approach until they have
already failed in their ﬁrst attempt. One example is the introduction of PCs and the cli-
ent/server architecture, with some organizations taking 20 years to solve the resulting
problems. 
The ﬁrst step towards adopting mobility in an enterprise has to be the establishment of
a mobility policy. This policy may include deployment rules, purchase rules, owner-
ships, budget responsibility, selection of device types, vendor selection, standards,
sanctions, etc. It is quite clear that most enterprises can justify selective mobilization
today.
Though mobility, security and web services are undoubtedly disparate technologies
with independent technical implications and histories, they must be considered
together in the context of the overall changes of paradigms, architectures and business
needs that will be witnessed over the next decade.
In the light of these developments, the important message for CIOs and other IT
experts and decision-makers is:
Bring together all the knowledge you possess concerning these three areas of technol-
ogy, align the security, mobility and application policies, set up your business solutions
on the basis of proven, standards-oriented infrastructures using easily integrable modu-
lar building blocks and elaborate a transitional plan that leads towards a service-ori-
ented architecture and that takes account of your enterprise’s business risks, the mobil-
ity requirements, web services integration and forward-looking business process man-
agement.
CIOs have never before been faced with such a critical shift of circumstances, one that
brings with it such a range of challenges and risks. However, taking the right decisions
now and transferring these to the safeguarding of their business solutions may also rep-
resent the greatest opportunity they have ever had.

The whole world is witnessing radical economic changes. Tradi-
tional markets are stagnating; global markets are emerging. Business 
processes are becoming more mobile, more ﬂexible, and much more 
streamlined. The boom companies of yesterday have disappeared from the scene. Such an envi-
ronment calls for innovative ideas – for new ways of doing business, for new products and 
services, and for a totally new world.
To survive, companies will have to be resilient and yet adaptable. To turn their visions into 
reality, they will have to act as well as react. Growth will come to only those companies that can 
identify demand and apply the right technological know-how to create tangible customer beneﬁt. 
Development, marketing, and sales departments must arrive at the right strategies, just as 
corporate organization, production, and logistics managers must devise and implement the best 
possible processes.
The book lays out some remarkable scenarios and ambitious visions for the future. It helps 
readers to formulate ideas and plot new directions for their business and points out the changes 
needed to meet challenges that lie ahead. The new role people will play in the evolving world of 
business also receives attention in this book that is at once informative and inspiring.

Due to the dramatic shifts in the knowledge economy, this book 
provides a signiﬁcant departure from traditional strategic manage-
ment concepts and practice. Designed for both advanced students and business managers, it 
presents a unique combination of new strategic management theory, carefully selected strategic 
management articles by prominent scholars such as Gary Hamel, Michael Porter, Peter Senge, 
and real-world case studies.
On top of this, the authors link powerful new benchmarks in strategic management thinking, 
including the concepts of Socio-Cultural Network Dynamics, Systemic Scorecards, and 
Customer Knowledge Management with practical business challenges and solutions of blue-chip 
companies with a superior performance (Laﬁte-Rothschild, Who's Who, Holcim, BRL Hardy, 
Kuoni BTI, Deutsche Bank, Unisys, Novartis).
