Abstract: This study introduces an aeroelastic model for the linear/non-linear 
analysis of thick fins in supersonic or hypersonic regimes. In the first step a linear 
aeroelastic model for the analysis of thick fins is developed. To this aim, a thick fin 
with two degrees of freedom (2 DOF) as well as an elastic double-wedged fin in 
supersonic/hypersonic flight regimes are considered. An unsteady aerodynamic 
model is developed based on the shock/expansion theory by local aspplication of 
the piston theory over the flat surfaces of the fin. The structural model is also 
obtained based on the Lagrangian approach. Employing such developed model, the 
effects of initial angle of attack, thickness and some other geometrical parameters 
on the aeroelastic stability boundaries and unsteady aerodynamic loads are studied. 
In the next step, a more sophisticated model describing the non-linear aeroelastic 
behavior of fins with 3 DOF and free-plays in flapping, plunging and pitching 
motions is investigated. To this aim, governing equation are obtained by a 
modification of the linear model and effects of several geometrical parameters (e.g. 
thickness, initial angle of attack, hinge frictional torque etc.) on the aeroelastic 
behavior of fins are assessed1.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Commonly, an aeroelastic problem has two types of modeling including 
aerodynamic loads and structural response calculation. Combination of 
these two types of modeling yields a coupled fluid-structure system which 
may be unstable in some flight conditions. In the present chapter, 
aeroelastic response of fins in supersonic/hypersonic flow is aimed. This 
matter leads to centralize on the unsteady aerodynamic loading models in 
supersonic/hypersonic regimes. One of the most applied unsteady

aerodynamic tools in supersonic regime is the piston theory. This theory 
describes the relation between the unsteady pressures over a flat plate in 
terms of the local angle of attack. Due to its simplicity and good accuracy, 
it has been considered as the most powerful as well as fast model for 
derivation of the unsteady aerodynamic pressure over a flat plate in panel 
flutter analysis. 
  
Also, the piston theory is known as a great technique for computation of 
unsteady aerodynamic loads, but its application on thick fins with nonzero 
angle of attack is accompanied with considerable errors. Liu [1] showed 
that the wing’s thickness has a considerable effect on the supersonic 
aerodynamic characteristics, in particular, shifting the location of the center 
of pressure forward and as a result reducing the flutter speed. Based on this 
fact, many researchers have tried to improve the results of piston theory in 
the aeroelastic and aerothermoelastic problems. 
  
One method to increase the accuracy of unsteady pressure distribution 
computation is the local usage of the piston theory over thick supersonic 
fins which was firstly suggested by Zhang et al. [2, 3]. According to this 
approach, first, flow properties are computed over the aerial structure 
surfaces by utilizing the Euler method, subsequently, the piston theory is 
applied locally to compute the unsteady aerodynamic loads. Firouz-abadi 
and Alavi [4] extended this approach and proposed a fast algorithm for the 
aeroelastic analysis of flexible supersonic fins with arbitrary polygonal 
cross-section and incidence angle of attack. Based on the shock/expansion 
wave theory, they proposed a procedure to calculate the steady 
aerodynamic pressure over the wing instead of going through 
complications of the CFD simulations. This procedure avoids the extensive 
numerical computations and grid generation problems as well as providing 
a highly reasonable accuracy. 
Another important subject in aerodynamic models is considering the 
aerodynamic nonlinearities through the simulation. Aerodynamic

nonlinear response are commonly observed in turbulent flows and gusts. 
Flight at high angles of attack, shock waves in transonic and supersonic 
flow regimes, turbulence, flow ionization and high temperature fields are 
the other sources of aerodynamic nonlinearities which can affect the 
aeroelastic behavior of the wing [5, 6]. 
As mentioned above, the other side of an aeroelastic problem is the 
structural modeling. According to the literature, variety of structural 
models have been developed for the aeroelastic analysis of supersonic fins. 
Based on fin’s degree of freedom (DOF), these models can be classified 
from simple mass and stiffness models for 2-DOF fins to modal analysis 
based models for the elastic fins. As well as the aerodynamic loads, 
nonlinear structural models can improve the accuracy for specific 
situations. Structural nonlinearities are mainly due to large amplitude 
vibrations (geometric nonlinearity), material nonlinearities, thermal 
degradation and nonlinearity in the boundary conditions, which have 
considerable contributions in accurate estimations of the structural 
behavior. It’s customary, as a conventional modeling technique, to consider 
structural nonlinearities as some equivalent nonlinear springs.  
Seo et al. [7] followed the same structural modeling technique as 
mentioned above and studied the aeroelasticity of a 2-D typical section 
wing with multiple nonlinearities. They compared the nonlinearities in 
pitch and plunge springs with a single nonlinearity in the pitch. This 
comparison showed that, multiple structural nonlinearities in the 2-D 
typical wing section models are influenced by the pitch to plunge 
frequency ratio. Accordingly, it is deduced that the flutter speed is closely 
related to the frequency ratio providing that both pitch and plunge 
nonlinearities are present rather than just a single pitch nonlinearity. 
Using a 2-DOF typical section model, McIntosh et al. [8] investigated the 
stability and dynamic response of a supersonic wing. They considered both 
hardening and softening nonlinearities of the support springs and gave 
some comments for the accuracy improvements in the theoretical model.  

8  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Firouz-Abadi et al. 
 
Another conventional source of structural nonlinearities is the existence of 
free-plays in the actuator or support mechanism of a control fin or wing due 
to the manufacturing tolerances. This type of nonlinearity can impose limit 
cycle oscillations (LCOs) or chaotic vibrations [9-11]. Woolston et al. [12] 
investigated the effects of free-play in pitch, hysteresis and cubic 
nonlinearities on the aeroelastic stability of a 3-DOF wing and confirmed 
their results with the wind tunnel experiments. They showed that the 
free-play in pitch angle causes a remarkable decrease of the flutter speed 
compared to the results of the linear eigenvalue analysis of the same 
configuration. Yang and Zhao [13] performed theoretical and experimental 
studies on the aeroelastic instability of a two-dimensional wing model with 
non-linear pitching stiffness and free-plays. They came up with two stable 
LCOs of different amplitudes for some flight conditions. Hauenstein et al. 
[14] assessed the aeroelastic response of a 2-DOF wing with the free-play 
in pitch and plunge motions and obtained non-harmonic and chaotic 
responses. Based on the analytical and experimental investigations, they 
concluded that chaotic response does not occur when only one single 
nonlinearity is considered in the wing support.  
Abbas et al. [15] used the third-order piston theory along with a 2-DOF 
wing section model to analyze the supersonic flutter and post flutter 
behaviors under the effects of cubic stiffness nonlinearities and free-plays 
in both plunging and pitching motions. They observed LCOs and chaotic 
behaviors over a large variety of configurations of the aeroelastic system. 
Tang and Dowell [16] performed theoretical and experimental aeroelastic 
studies to investigate the effect of nonzero initial angle of attack on the 
flutter, LCO and gust response of a typical wing section with control 
surface free-play in an incompressible flow. 
In this chapter, modeling the unsteady aerodynamic loads acting on thick 
supersonic fins are estimated by the local application of the piston theory. 
To this aim the steady state properties of the flow over the surface of the 
fin are obtained using the shock/expansion wave equations and the piston 

Linear/Non-Linear Aeroelastic Response                   Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  9 
 
theory is applied locally to compute the aerodynamic loads in terms of the 
fin’s DOF. To show the feasibility of the aerodynamic modeling, linear 
aeroelastic analysis of two different fins (a 2 DOF rigid and an elastic fin) 
are performed and the stability margins are determined. Next, a more 
comprehensive model of 3D fins with three degrees of freedom 
(constrained in plunging, pitching and flapping motions with springs) is 
considered. Assuming free-plays in all degrees of freedom, governing 
equations of motion are derived and the unsteady aerodynamic lift and 
moments are calculated using the previously introduced procedure. 
Finally, the linear and nonlinear aeroelastic stability is performed and the 
effect of thickness, incidence angle of attack, hinge position, sweep angle 
and hinge frictional viscous damping torque on the LCOs and chaotic 
behavior of the fin is outlined. 
 
Linear Structural Modeling of a General Fin 
 
For the general aeroelastic problem, the structural model is usually 
obtained by applying the Lagrangian dynamics and then implementing the 
modal analysis technique. Following the Lagrangian dynamics’ principles, 
a general representation of the equations of motion can be expressed as

potential and kinetic energies, respectively. 
Based on the modal analysis technique, the elastic displacement and 
rotation vectors at any point of the fin can be expanded as

edge. The flexibility of the support is modeled by three springs 
constraining the plunging (h), pitching (α) and flapping (β) motions. Also, 
three viscous dampers, indicated by cα, cβ and ch support the fin in each 
degrees of freedom.

where hf, αf and βf are the free-plays of the corresponding degrees of 
freedom. Also, Tf (α) is the constant frictional torque applied on the hinge, 
which is positive for α & < 0 and negative for α & > 0. Fig. (2) shows 
variation of elastic restoring torque, force and moment, schematically, as 
functions of displacement and rotation components, h, α and β. This can be 
clearly deduced that each of the typical curves shown in Fig. (2) cannot be 
captured by just a single linear function and this is the main source of 
nonlinearity in the present formulation. Actually, the amount of exerted 
forces and moments are nonlinear functions of the corresponding 
displacements and rotations which is the basic idea in nonlinear 
oscillations.

For thin fins in zero angle of attack, weak compression and expansion 
waves occur over the surface and thus the variations of flow properties (e.g. 
Mach number, temperature and density) on the surface are negligible. But, 
if the thickness of the fin is considerable or it is oriented in a nonzero angle 
of attack, the flow properties change drastically behind the shock and 
expansion waves. Having this in mind, one must obtain the flow properties 
over the fin's surfaces and apply the piston theory locally on each surface. 
Steady Supersonic Flow Over the Fin 
The flow properties behind shock and expansion waves over the fin 
surfaces can be obtained numerically using steady CFD solvers. However, 
such computational tools are usually time consuming due to their 
limitations for grid generation and iterative numerical schemes, especially 
for 3D geometries. The shock/expansion wave theory is one of the simplest 
methods which furnishes analytical relations for the solution of steady two 
or three dimensional supersonic flows. Recalling that these waves are 
inherently two dimensional in nature, a procedure is purposed to solve the 
steady flow over the fin. 
Fig. (3) shows a sketch of surfaces of a thick fin in supersonic flow. The 
upper and lower surfaces of the fin are numbered individually and the 
Mach number, density and temperature of the ith surface are denoted by
M ,

where ni-1 and ni are the outward normal vectors of the corresponding

edge line Oi-1 Oʹi-1 and when it is positive an oblique shock wave is 
expected to occur.

General Concepts in Nonlinear Analysis of Dynamical Systems 
This chapter is particularly intended to review some highlights of the 
complex behaviors like bifurcations, Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) and 
Chaos which are generally encountered in nonlinear dynamical systems as 
well as some frequently implemented tools, namely, the Lyapunov 
exponents and Phase plot diagrams. 
Bifurcation Theory 
Variation of one or more parameters in a nonlinear system can change the 
number of equilibrium points both quantitatively and qualitatively. They 
occur in both continuous systems (described by ODEs or PDEs), and 
discrete systems (described by maps). The study of such changes 
(especially qualitative and topological changes) is basically referred as 
bifurcation theory. The value for which the qualitative changes happen in 
motion is called the critical or bifurcation value. Detection of bifurcation 
points are so vital to engineering designers because they provide severe and 
rapid transitions (instabilities) as some control parameter is varied.

Linear/Non-Linear Aeroelastic Response                   Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  21 
 
There are several classifications to the bifurcation types and bifurcating 
behaviors. One major classification is local versus global bifurcation. 
Local bifurcations are detectable by analyzing the local stability properties 
or the equilibrium points (i.e. existence of positive real part for any of the 
eigenvalues of the characteristic equation) or periodic orbits; whereas, 
global bifurcations are not noticeable just by looking at the nature of 
equilibrium points of the system while changing the bifurcating parameter. 
In this chapter, the only presented bifurcations are the local ones, so we are 
not going any further discussing global bifurcations. Some examples of 
local bifurcations include: saddle-node (fold), transcritical, pitchfork (flip), 
hopf, period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker (Secondary Hopf) bifurcations. 
Dynamical systems can present an infinite sequence of period doubling 
bifurcations under the variation of a single parameter culminating in a 
chaotic motion. For more information regarding any of the above 
mentioned bifurcations the reader is referred to any of [18] or [19]. 
Phase Plots 
A phase plot is a geometrical representation of the evolutions of the system 
states (which are generally position and velocity states) with time. Plane 
comprising both system states is usually called the phase plane. These plots 
are famous for the great amount of information they can convey for any 
dynamical system. The information include the presence of limit cycle 
oscillations as well as attractive and repulsive natures near each 
equilibrium point. If the response tends asymptotically to some closed orbit 
for any given initial value, then the system is said to have limit cycle 
oscillations. Systems having LCOs are so practical because they guarantee 
a specific response for any initial value. Such systems can also compensate 
for any undesirable perturbation and noises imposed by external factors. 
Other types of behavior such as periodic, quasi-periodic and non-periodic 
responses can also be seen in phase plot diagrams. 
 

22  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Firouz-Abadi et al. 
 
Chaos 
Chaotic vibrations are encountered in specific nonlinear systems. 
Although, there is no unique and widely accepted definition for chaotic 
dynamics, a common definition says that, any chaotic system must possess 
the following conditions, 
1. It must be sensitive to small changes in the initial conditions. 
2. It must contain a broad frequency spectrum even for the case of 
single harmonic excitations. 
3. It must have dense periodic orbits. 
4. The complexity of motion must increase while changing one or 
more parameters, namely, there should be routes to chaos (e.g. 
period doubling bifurcations). 
5. Existence of fractal like behaviors in the Poincare maps. 
The above points are accounted just as the main indications of chaotic 
systems. However, in order to have a reliable identification of chaotic 
behavior, it’s vital to introduce sophisticated diagnostic tests such as 
maximum Lyapunov exponents. 
Lyapunov Exponents 
The Lyapunov exponents are a powerful tool for diagnosing whether or not 
an oscillation is chaotic. It actually characterizes the rate of separation of 
infinitesimally close trajectories. Quantitatively, two trajectories in phase 
space with initial separation δZ0 diverge at a rate given by: 
0
( )
t
Z t
e
Z



 
(40) 
where λ is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation can be different 
for different orientations of initial separation vector. Thus, there is a variety 

Linear/Non-Linear Aeroelastic Response                   Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  23 
 
of Lyapunov exponents. It is common to refer to the largest one as the 
maximum Lyapunov exponent. A positive Maximum Lyapunov exponent 
is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic (provided that 
some other conditions are met, e.g., dense periodic orbits in the phase 
space). The maximum Lyapunov exponent can be defined as [20].

The reasonable agreements between the present results and those of 
2D/3D CFD simulations confirms that a combination of the local piston 
and shock/expansion wave theories yields reliable results in predicting the 
aerodynamic coefficients which are required in the aeroelastic analysis.

Figs. (7 and 8) illustrate the variations of the aerodynamic coefficients 
with the thickness ratio for zero angle of attack as well as nonzero angle 
of attack for t/c=10%. The obtained results show the remarkable effect of 
thickness and initial angle of attack on the aerodynamic derivatives. 
Results also show that the sensitivity of the aerodynamic derivatives to 
the Mach number decreases at higher Mach number values.

Verification of Aeroelastic Model 
To verify the aeroelastic model, a clamped delta wing as shown in Fig. (9) 
is considered. An aeroelastic analysis is performed and the obtained 
results are compared with those from the wind tunnel tests carried out at 
NASA Langley wind tunnel by Tuovila and McCarty [21]. The 
experiment was carried out at Mach 3 with the air density of 0.37kg/m3. 
The wing is considered to be made of magnesium plate with 0.86mm 
thickness, elastic modulus of 42.8GPa, density of 1766kg/m3 and Poisson

Effect of Geometrical Parameters on the Aeroelastic Analysis 
This section is provided to evaluate the influence of the geometrical 
parameters (e.g. thickness, angle of attack, sweep angle and taper ratio) on 
aeroelastic behavior of the supersonic fin based on the local piston theory. 
Accordingly, a structural model as displayed in Fig. (11) is considered. The 
model is constrained by pitching and plunging springs. The geometrical 
dimensions of the fin are as given in Table 1.

Fig. (12) shows the flutter and divergence speed of the fin versus the 
thickness ratio. The results illustrate that there is a remarkable reduction in 
the aeroelastic stability margin when the thickness increases, particularly in 
the low angles of attack. 
The incidence angle is another effective factor in the aeroelastic stability of 
the supersonic fin. Increasing the initial angle of attack, causes a forward 
shift in the location of the center of pressure and thus leads to a sharp 
decrease in the divergent Mach number. Fig. (13) shows the variation of the 
flutter and divergence Mach number with the initial angle of attack at 
different thicknesses of the fin. The results show that increasing the initial 
angle of attack causes the flutter Mach number of the fin to grow at high 
thicknesses. On the other hand, according to the forward shift of the 
pressure center, the divergent Mach number reduces with increasing angle 
of attack. Qualitatively speaking, variation of the fin’s thickness or angle of 
attack, may change the instability type from flutter to divergence.

shock/expansion waves on the fin and thus increases the aeroelastic 
stability. Fig. (14) illustrates the effect of sweep angle on the flutter and 
divergence Mach numbers of the fin for different thickness ratios. These 
results identify the increase of the aeroelastic stability with the growth of 
the sweep angle. Further it is observed that for high sweep angles, the 
instability type changes from flutter to divergence.

ratio. 
Taper ratio is the last geometrical parameter studied in this section. 
Actually taper ratio reduces the undesired effects of the fin’s tip and 
improves the aerodynamic efficiency of the supersonic fins. Variations of 
the flutter and divergence speeds of the considered fin versus taper ratio is 
depicted in Fig. (15) for several thickness ratios. Taper ratio is considered 
to be applied on both the chord and thickness of the fin. The obtained 
results implies that the aeroelastic instability margins of the fin reduces as 
the taper ratio increases.

The fin is clamped to a rigid base and is made up of a composite shell with 
uniform thickness of 0.5mm, which forms the outer aerodynamic surfaces 
and is filled by foam. The fin surface is considered to be a four layered 
Carbon/epoxy composite with symmetric cross-ply orientation. Table 3

Non-linear Aeroelastic Analysis  
This section aims at studying the effects of fin’s geometrical parameter on 
non-linear response of thick supersonic fins. Hence, a fin with a similar 
configuration as the elastic fin, shown in Fig. (16) is chosen and free-plays 
are assumed to exist in all DOFs. 
Effects of Airspeed Mach Number 
To perform a nonlinear analysis, the values given in Table 4 are adopted. 
For the comparison purposes, both linear and nonlinear analysis are 
conducted for a 3D fin. To account for the linear aeroelastic behavior, an 
eigenvalue analysis at the sea level conditions is performed and results are 
shown in Fig. (20). These results show that the flutter takes place at 
6.35.

In the next step, results from the nonlinear dynamics of the same fin is of 
interest. As the plunging, flapping and pitching responses are quite similar 
in behavior, the graphical illustrations are restricted only to the pitching 
time-histories. Fig. (21a) shows the dynamic behavior of the fin as a

function of Mach number through a bifurcation diagram. In the bifurcation 
diagram, the vertical axis depicts the local maxima and local minima of the 
torsional angle time series after converging to steady state response, and 
the horizontal axis is the Mach number. This figure is divided into four 
regions. In the first portion, for 
5.1
M 
, since all local maxima and 
minima of time series overlap each other, it is concluded that the solution 
converges to an equilibrium condition. Bifurcation occurs at 
5.1
M 
. 
Considering this as the flutter onset and comparing with the estimated 
flutter speed from the linear case, it’s concluded that the flutter Mach 
number is decreased by 1.25 units. In the second and third regions, for 
5.1
7.2
M 

, LCOs occur. In these regions, LCOs' amplitude increases 
as Mach number increases. Also, between these two regions bifurcation 
happens again.

Finally, it seems that chaotic response starts at region four where 
7.2

. 
The Lyapunov exponent is presented in Fig. (21b) at various Mach 
numbers. The magnitude of the exponent changes to positive for

which confirms chaotic response in the fourth region. Fig. (21c) 
depicts period of the oscillation at different Mach numbers. The periods of 
oscillation are 0, 0.013, 0.027 and infinite for the consequent regions, 
respectively. It means that at
6.3
M 
, a period doubling phenomenon 
occurs. To have a better investigation, time histories and the phase-plane 
diagrams for Mach numbers 3, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5 are plotted in Figs. (22 to 
25). These diagrams are obtained after the transient response, so the 
responses converge to steady state behavior.

Effects of Thickness 
Thickness is also another effective parameter which can lead to significant 
changes in the aeroelastic behavior of the fin. As shown in the linear case, 
aerodynamic loads are totally deviated as the thickness ratio changes. In 
the nonlinear case, this parameter can also lead to both quantitatively and 
qualitatively different behaviors compared to the linear analysis. The 
following conditions for the free stream flow is considered. 
The dynamic response of the fin at different thickness to chord ratios (t/c) is 
depicted in Fig. (26a). According to this figure, which is drawn based on 
local max/min values of the torsional angle time series, it is observed that 
for t/c up to 10.2% the solution converges to an equilibrium condition and 
at t/c = 10.2% bifurcation occurs. Stable LCOs was experienced at 
thickness ratios ranging from 10.2 to 16.7, while chaotic response happens 
at 16.7 <t/c<19. Based on this diagram, bifurcation occurs again between 
the second and the third regions. Fig. (26b) shows the Lyapunov exponent 
versus the thickness ratio which emphasizes chaotic response at

16.7<t/c<19. Period variation versus the thickness ratio is illustrated in Fig. 
(26c). Magnitude of the period in the first and fourth regions are zero and 
infinite, respectively. At the beginning of the second region, it jumps to 
0.013 and it doubles (period doubling) in the third region. To have a better 
investigation, time histories and the phase-plane plots for various 
thicknesses are shown in Figs. (27 to 30). These diagrams are plotted after 
converging to the steady state behavior.

Effect of Initial Angle of Attack 
The influence of initial angle of attack on the dynamic response of fins with 
t/c = 10% loaded at a flow stream just as the previous case is depicted in 
Fig. (31a). As can be seen, the fin remains stable in the first region. At α0 = 
10.2° bifurcation occurs and after that stable LCOs are encountered. Fig.

Effect of Hinge Position 
Hinge position is another indispensable parameter which affects the 
nonlinear dynamic response of the fin. Variation of this parameter changes 
thoroughly the moment distribution on the fin which in return changes the 
instability boundaries as well as the dynamic behavior of the fin. Using an 
eigenvalue analysis, Figs. (35 and 36) are plotted to show changes in the 
damping and frequency at x/c = 0.55 and x/c = 0.57, where x/c is the hinge 
position to chord ratio. Comparison of these figures depicts that receding 
the hinge from the leading edge changes the flutter mode from the plunging 
to pitching. To dig further into the problem, effect of x/c on the dynamic 
behavior of the fin is investigated via Fig. (37a). Based on the dynamic 
response, this figure is divided into the three regions. In the first region, 
solution converges to an equilibrium condition but in the second one LCOs 
happen. Based on this diagram bifurcation occurs at x/c = 0.57.

Also, it seems at this point that the unstable mode shifts from plunging to 
pitching Figs. (35 and 36). In the third region, 
 different 
types of behavior (periodic and chaotic) occur. Fig. (37b) shows variations 
of the Lyapunov exponent versus x/c. Based on this figure, periodic 
response is considered at 
 (position A). Also, a chaotic 
behavior is predicted for the fin in the remaining positions of the third 
region. Similar to other investigated parameters, in Fig. (37c) the period of 
oscillation as a function of the hinge position is shown. Finally, time 
histories and the phase-plane diagrams at different hinge positions are 
illustrated in Figs. (38-41). 
Effect of Sweep Angle 
Sweep angle is one of the crucial parameters in the design of supersonic 
fins. Increasing the sweep angle results in weaker shock/expansion waves 
on the fin and thus increases the aeroelastic stability. Fig. (42) shows 
positive and negative direction of sweep angles. Dynamic behavior of the 
fin is traced in Fig. (43a) as a function of sweep angle. Based on the 
recorded dynamic response, the presented figure is divided into four 
regions. In the first one, the dynamic behavior converges into a stable state. 
Limit cycle oscillations are observed in the next two regions and finally 
chaotic motion happens in the last part. Further, it can be seen that 
bifurcation occurs twice at sweep angles of 1.7° and 0.9°. According to Fig. 
(43b), the Lyapunov exponent turns positive in region 4 which confirms 
chaotic response in that region. Fig. (43c) depicts period of oscillation at 
different sweep angles. Also, time histories and the phase-plane diagrams 
for sweep angles -10°, 0°, 3° and 15° are shown through Figs. (44-47).

A 3D fin with the structural characteristics given in Table 5 is considered. 
Using this configuration, the sea level aeroelastic behavior of the fin is 
investigated by an eigenvalue analysis. The U-g diagrams obtained from

linear model. 
To study the effects of frictional torque on non-linear response of thick 
supersonic fins, it is assumed that the fin’s structure involves free-plays at 
all degree of freedom and frictional torque is applied on pitch DOF.     
Fig. (49) illustrates the dynamic behavior of the fin under consideration as 
a function of Mach number through bifurcation diagrams. As shown, the 
vertical axis depicts the local maxima and local minima of the 
corresponding motion after converging to steady state response, and the 
horizontal axis shows the Mach number. According to the fin's dynamic 
response, this figure is divided to four regions. It can be seen that for the 
Mach numbers of less than 4.2, since all local maxima and minima of the 
time series are overlapped, the solution converges to an equilibrium 
condition. It is obvious that increasing the Mach number causes LCOs 
begin at Mach number 4.1. Further augmentations of the Mach number 
leads to larger vibration amplitudes. Finally, it can be seen that the 
amplitude of LCOs tends to infinity for M∞ ≥ 8.63. For a more 
comprehensive investigation, time histories and phase-plane diagrams for 
Mach values of 2.5, 4.5, 7.65 and 8 are plotted in all DOFs in Figs. (50 to 
53). These diagrams are obtained after in the steady state response 
conditions.

Abstract: This paper focus on the assessment of aerodynamic forces applied on an 
aircraft. First, numerical analysis is performed on a simplified linear 
two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) airfoil system model. Methods of aerodynamic 
force determination are established at different airspeed conditions and the 
calculated dynamic forces correlated well to the actual forces. Next, a finite 
element model of the airfoil is developed to represent its structural dynamics, and 
the established force determination methods are applied to determine the 
aerodynamic forces acting on such model. After that, a physical downsizing model 
of the airfoil is manufactured and its natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode 
shapes are calculated and compared to those obtained from the analytical models. 
Vibration experiments are also conducted to measure the physical model’s 
structural response in the wind tunnel, and its aerodynamic forces are calculated 
based on the data recorded by the attached accelerometers. 
Keywords: Aircraft wing model, Experimental measurement, Force 
determination methods, Frequency response function, Multiple-degree-of- 
freedom system, Vibratory force and moment.

INTRODUCTION 
During flight, aircraft wings always present varying structural responses 
because subject to varying aerodynamic loadings. The applied 
aerodynamic loadings and the aircraft wing’s structural responses are 
coupled together to create a complicated vibration effect known as 
structural coupling dynamics. This effect can reduce the service life of the 
aircraft significantly. Sometimes, sustained vibration at natural 
frequencies of airfoils may lead to catastrophic structural failure. 
 
Structural coupling dynamics, first developed in the early 1920’s, has 
become an important concern in design of aircrafts. To date, a number of 
researchers have dedicated tremendous effort and time to lighten the 
materials of aircrafts so as to obtain an effective loading capacity. 
However, as the aircraft speed keeps on increasing, the structural 
flexibility of the aircrafts receives more design concerns because it may 
cause serious flutter in the airfoil and other aircraft components.  
Considering a typical cross-sectional plane of an airfoil, the gravity center 
G is located at the 42% ~ 45% of the chord line, and the elasticity center 
is located at the 38% ~ 40% of the chord line. Therefore, the gravity 
center is not coincident with the elastic center, which results in a coupling 
effect between the translational and rotational degree-of-freedom of the 
wing. This coupling effect and the structure – air coupling effect make it 
difficult to solve the aerodynamic force of aircraft wings. 
The aerodynamic forces, which are extremely difficult to obtain from a 
flying aircraft, can usually be measured from experimental simulations. 
As a direct, effective, and easy-to-use approach in the aerodynamic study, 
experimental methods have been extensively employed to simulate the 
aircraft’s flying condition, so as to measure the aerodynamic forces and 
the structural responses. 
In this chapter, methods are developed for determining the aerodynamic 
forces acting on the aircraft wings during flight. The methods are initially

developed for a 2DOF linear system, and then extended for a MDOF 
system developed as a finite element model. Wind tunnel test is then 
conducted to obtain the physical dynamic parameters. The finite element 
model and the force determination method are then validated by 
comparing the analytical results with the experimental results.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Dynamic response of aircraft model during flight has received a lot of 
interests, and a number of analytical and experimental methods have been 
developed about the simulating and analyzing the aircraft structures. The 
literature search focus on two areas: the analytical study of airfoil system 
and the experimental study of that system. 
Analytical Study 
Yosibash and Kirby [1] constructed a high order simulation model of 
fluid-structure for the airfoil under flying conditions. The authors utilized 
spectral/hp solver for fluid (air) and hp-FEM solver for the airfoil to 
handle the coupling problem generated by aerodynamic and structure 
interaction. The two solvers somehow can minimize the modeling errors 
and the discretization errors. The ongoing verification and validation of 
fluid-structure interaction are also presented. In their study the airfoil was

treated as a flexible thin plate in the flow and the one-way coupling and 
two-way coupling were discussed separately. The coupled fluid-structure 
method was also used by Liu et al. [2] in calculation of wing flutter. 
Fabunmi [3] presented a method of using the pseudo-inverse technique to 
determine the operating vibratory loads on a structural system. In his 
work, two types of uniform beam were studied: the cantilever beam and 
the free end beam. Results of numerical calculations showed that the 
accuracy of the determined forces correlates well with a parameter that is 
related to the number of modes contributing to the response of the 
structure at a given frequency. Shyy and Kamakoti [4] studied the 
interactions between rigid and flexible structures and fluid based on an 
airfoil system model. A loosely coupled approach was used to perform the 
combined fluid and structure computations. Two different airfoil 
configurations were employed to obtain the displacement of the airfoil 
and the pressure on it. A suitable interfacing technique was incorporated 
to couple and synchronize the flow and structure solver. Liu and Shepard 
[5] addressed an approach of dynamic force identification based on 
enhanced least squares and total least-squares schemes in the frequency 
domain. This approach is effective in reducing the random errors that 
occur in structural response signals. Two regularization filters, named as 
the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) filter and the 
Tikhonov filter, were employed in conjunction with the conventional 
least-squares scheme at specific frequencies. A new least-squares form of 
the Morozov’s discrepancy principle was formulated to aid in selecting 
the optimum regularization parameter for these filters at each frequency. 
The accuracy in using conventional least-squares, TSVD-based 
least-squares, and Tikhonov filter-based least-squares schemes were 
compared analytically and numerically in their study. E. Parloo et al. [6] 
demonstrated a method of identifying dynamic force by means of 
in-operation modal models. The applicability of the sensitivity-based 
normalization approach for force identification on the basis of output-only 
data was evaluated. The quality of the reconstructed FRF data and the 
advantages of using an iterative weighted pseudo-inverse approach over a 
classic pseudo-inverse one were discussed through experiments

performed on a beam structure.  
Aerodynamics of airfoil models remains an important topic in aircraft 
research, and most recent work in the area involves some aspect of airfoil 
modeling and its nonlinear aeroelastic analysis. Kim and Lee [7, 8] 
created a two-dimensional flexible airfoil with a freeplay nonlinearity in 
pitch and analyzed this model in the subsonic flow range. Structurally, the 
airfoil was modeled as finite beam elements and two spring elements in 
pitch and plunge. A doublet lattice method was used for the 
two-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics to include the camber deflection 
effect. The fictitious mass modal approach was adopted in order to use the 
consistent modal coordinates for the structures with nonlinearity. 
Nonlinear aeroelastic analyses for both the frequency domain and time 
domain were performed for rigid and flexible airfoil models to investigate 
the flexibility effect. Dynamic response of this airfoil model such as limit 
cycle oscillation and chaotic motion were observed and they were highly 
influenced by the pitch-to-plunge frequency ratio. Lee et al. [9] derived 
the equations of motion of a two-dimensional airfoil oscillating in pitch 
and plunge for a structural nonlinearity using subsonic aerodynamic 
theory. In their works, three classical aerodynamic nonlinearities 
involving cubic, freeplay and hysteresis were investigated in detail.  
Besides the simplified two-dimensional models, more complicated 
aircraft wing models were created for purpose of analytical analysis, 
which usually are multi-degree-of-freedom models. Roy and Eversman 
[10, 11] created a multi-degree-of-freedom finite element model for the 
flexile wing structure, with beam elements for bending and rod elements 
for torsion. This model was then used to investigate the potential of an 
adaptive feed-forward controller for active flutter suppression of a 
flexible wing. Dimitriadis and Cooper [12] presented a method for 
identification of non-linear multi-degree-of-freedom systems and used 
this method to model aeroelastic systems for tracking the stability of 
aircraft during flight flutter testing.

Experimental Study 
Conner, et al. [13] created an experimental model which closely 
approximated a 3D aeroelastic typical section in 2D incompressible flow 
and used that model to determine the system response of the aeroelastic 
section with control surface freeplay. Schewe, et al. [14, 15] performed 
flutter and forced oscillation experiments in a transonic wind tunnel using 
an aeroelastic supercritical 2D airfoil model. From those experiments, 
typical transonic phenomena were studied and small-amplitude limit 
cycle oscillations were observed under different flow conditions. It was 
found that very small control forces were sufficient to excite or suppress 
flutter oscillations of the airfoil system. Chen [16] performed an 
experimental study including wind tunnel tests to determine the flutter 
derivatives of section models under smooth and turbulent flows applying 
a neural-network-based method. In his study, the dynamic response 
observed from the experiments and the measured mean velocities of wind 
flow were used to validate an appropriate neural network. Tang and 
Dowell [17] constructed an experimental high-aspect-ratio wing 
aeroelastic model with a slender body at the tip and measured its response 
due to flutter and limit-cycle oscillations in a wind tunnel test. Important 
experimental results such as the flutter velocity, oscillation frequency, and 
static deformations were correlated with numerical results. Potter and 
Lind [18] developed a method to test an uncertainty model for modal 
analysis and robust flutter analysis using ground vibration testing data. In 
their tests the aircraft wing has a NACA-65A004 shape and is composed 
of a body, an aileron, and a boom. A measurement and an excitation 
system were installed on the wing model. The measure system consisted 
of 16 strain gages and 2 accelerometers and the excitation system 
employed a piezoelectric material. Pickrel [19] demonstrated a method to 
improve and validate the structural dynamic model for ground vibration 
testing. The structural dynamic model was validated by comparing its 
predicted modes with experimental modes. Because the author assumed 
linearity on this structural model, the errors would be too large in a high 
frequency domain, in which nonlinear structure response becomes

dominant. Lee [20], Joshi [21], Sun [22], and Nakade [23] developed 
different experimental methods to measure the unsteady aerodynamic 
loadings and investigate the interaction between the loadings and the 
object’s dynamic structural response.

As shown in Fig. (3a), when U increases, n1 increases and n2 decreases 
steadily. The damping ratio of the second mode ζ2 decreases with an 
increasing airspeed U and it reaches zero at the critical speed Ucr. At air 
speed U > Ucr, ζ2 < 0, and hence the system becomes unstable.

where, on the right hand side are the aerodynamic force and the excitation 
force at the aileron, which are referred to actual forces on the system. The 
objective of this study is to determine the actual forces using the 
displacement data measured during the aircraft’s flight. 
Indirect force identification is a method for estimating dynamic forces 
acting on a structural or mechanical system by using the system’s 
frequency response matrix and response measurements. This method is 
often used to determine the unknown dynamic forces that occur when the 
system is operating, at which time these forces cannot be directly 
measured. This method is derived from the multi-input/multi-output 
(MIMO) transfer function relationship for linear systems as: 
X() = H()F()                                          (8) 
where ω is frequency; X(ω) is an output vector of the system’s structural 
responses; F(ω) is an input vector of applied dynamic forces; and H(ω) is 
the frequency response matrix of this system. Assuming H(ω) is known, 
and the F(ω) can be determined as: 
F() = H()-1X() (H() is a square matrix) 
 
       (9) 
or 
F() = [H()T H()]-1H()TX() (H() is a non-square matrix)    (10) 
From above equations, it can be seen that in order to determine the force 
F(ω), the H(ω) and X(ω) has to be constructed or measured through 
experiments.

H(ω) = (-ω2M + jωC + K)-1 
 
 
 
        (11) 
In Eq. (11), noise can be directly added to H(ω) in order to represent an 
experimentally measured frequency response matrix which involves the 
noise effects. According to Fabunmi [3], we have: 
H(ω) = H(ω) + Enoise, and

Here γ is the percentage error level and ρ is a randomly generated number 
which belongs to [-1, 1]. The frequency response matrix H(ω) then can be 
inverted and used in Eq. (8) to identify the external forces F(ω). 
Force Determination Using “H1” & “H2” Estimated Frequency 
Response Matrices 
As an alternative approach, consider that H(ω) can be determined from 
experimental data measured through conducting a ground vibration test 
on an aircraft. In order to simulate the experiment, random measurement 
noise is added to the force and displacement signals.

where γ is the noise level. The frequency response matrix then can be

      (15) 
 
H2 = GXXGXF

76  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                           Bi and Liu 
 
 
Here “H1” and “H2” are the estimated frequency response matrices, GFF 
and GFX are auto-power spectrum of force (F) and cross-power spectrum 
of force (F) and displacement (X), respectively. Likewise, GXX and GXF 
are auto-power spectrum of displacement (X) and cross-power spectrum 
of displacement (X) and force (F). The frequency response matrices 
determined by Eq. (15) or (16) are transposed and inverted, and then are 
substituted into Eq. (9) or (10) to calculate the forces F(ω). Such method 
is called “H1” and “H2” force determination method. 
Direct Force Determination “F1” and “F2” Methods 
The “H1” and “H2” force estimation methods can be improved by 
following transformation, from Eq. (15) we have: 
 
H1
-1 = GFFGFX
-1, H1
T = GFF
-TGFX
T, and H1
-T = GFX
-TGFF

      (17) 
 
Similarly, from Eq. (16) we have: 
 
H2
-1 = GXFGXX
-1, H1
T = GXF
-TGXX
T, and H1
-T = GXX
-TGXF
T  
      (18) 
 
Eqs. (17 and 18) calculate the inverted frequency response matrix directly, 
which can reduce the error introduced during the inversion of the 
frequency response matrix. The forces then can be calculated by 
substituting Eqs. (17), (18) into Eq. (9) or (10). 
Validation of Force Determination Methods  
To verify the aforementioned force determination approaches, these 
methods are employed to simulate the two degree-of-freedoms airfoil 
system model (Figs. 1 and 2). At first, the traditional pseudo-inverse 
technique is employed to determine the aerodynamic forces and it is 
assumed that the frequency response function matrix for force 
determination is measured from experimental test. Fig. (4) plots the 
estimated Frequency Response Function H(ω) (FRF) using the traditional

Vibratory Force for Aircraft Wings                        Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  85 
 
EVALUATE AERODYNAMICS FORCE USING MDOF SYSTEM 
MDOF Aircraft Wing Model 
The presented force determination methods (Eqs. 9 to 18) are then applied 
for multi-degree-of-freedom wing models. 
Fig. (17). Finite element aeroelastic aircraft wing model. 
As shown in Fig. (17), an aircraft wing is modeled as a multi-degree- 
of-freedom pitch-plunge system with torsional and bending beam 
elements. This system is also governed by Eq. (1), where M and K are 
mass and stiffness matrices for the beam elements. For each beam 
element “i”, its mass and stiffness matrices are:

Here a = (ρIpl)/6, b = (ρAl)/420, c = GJ/l, d = EI/l3, yθ is the Y-distance 
between the wing’s gravity and elastic center; ρ is the material’s density; 
Ip and I are the polar and regular moment of inertia of the wing model’s 
cross section, respectively; A is the cross-sectional area; l denotes the length 
of single element; G denotes the shear modulus of elasticity; J represents 
the polar moment of inertia; and E is the Young’s modulus (see Fig. 17). 
The input vector b and the proportional damping matrix C are given as: 
b = [-ca, -ca, …, -ca, 1, 1, …, 1]; C = αM + βK 
 
      (21) 
where ca is the Y-distance between the trailing edge and the gravity center, 
and α and β are the proportional damping constant. 
The displacement vector x (assume this model has n elements): 
x = [θ, x]T = [θ1, …, θn, x1, …, xn]T  
 
 
      (22) 
where θi is the ith element’s rotational displacement and xi is its 
translational displacement. The system’s mass and stiffness matrices can

where ρ0 is the air density; c is the chord length, c0 is the Y-distance 
between the leading edge and the elastic center (Fig. 17); and CL is the 
local lift coefficient. The derivative dCL/dθ is assumed to be constant, 
with a theoretical value of 2π for incompressible flow. 
Boundary conditions are added on the global system, which assume that 
the initial bending, torsional, and translational displacements are zero.

Validation of Force Determination Methods  
In this section, Eqs. (9 to 18) are applied to determine the aerodynamic 
forces acting on this multi-degree-freedom airfoil system and the 
estimated forces and moments are compared to the actual values.  
First, the traditional pseudo-inverse technique is employed to determine 
the aerodynamic forces and the frequency response function matrix H(ω) 
is calculated from Eqs. (11 and 12). Fig. (22) displays the first response 
function in the force response matrix, H11. Figs. (23 and 24) compare the 
actual and estimated forces and moments. From both figures, it can be 
found that by using the traditional pseudo-inverse method, the average 
percentages for the forces and moments are 0.2027% and 0.5962%, 
respectively.

Next, the frequency response function H11, actual, estimate forces and 
moments, as well as percentage errors are calculated by “H1” and “H2” 
methods. The noise is added through Eqs. (13 and 14). The results plotted 
in following figures are formulated at air speed of 9.34 m/s and noise 
level of 5%. As shown in Figs. (25 and 26), the average percentage errors 
for force and moment calculated from H1 method are 17.36% and 15.80%. 
Nevertheless, the percentage errors given by H2 method are 22.42% and 
20.74%, as displayed in Figs. (27 and 28). 
 
Fig. (25). Actual, estimated translational force and percentage error, U/Ucr = 2/3 with 5% noise 
using H1 method, based on multi-degree-of-freedom model.

to 34). The displayed results are obtained at the airspeed of 9.34 m/s and 
noise level of 5%. According to Figs. (29 and 30), the average percentage 
errors for the force and moment yielded from the “F1” method are 8.77%

DISCUSSIONS 
In above sections, the forces and moments estimated from the traditional 
pseudo-inverse method, “H1” and “H2” methods, as well as “F1” and “F2” 
methods are compared to the actual values. From these comparisons, it is 
found that the errors caused by the pseudo-inverse method are much 
lower than those errors yielded from other methods, which is because in 
that method, the mass, stiffness and damping matrices are directly 
obtained from the two degrees-of-freedom and multi-degree-of-freedom 
models. However, in reality, those matrices are difficult to be obtained 
from a real complicated model. In the “H1”, “H2”, “F1”, “F2” methods 
which use cross-spectrum and auto-spectrum, the frequency response 
function is estimated from the input force and the corresponding structural 
response. Therefore, such methods are easier to apply for force 
determination in real problems. 
Compared to the “H1” and “H2” methods, the “F1” and “F2” methods yield 
lower errors in identifying the force and moment values. This is because 
the direct determination methods directly calculate the inverted frequency 
response matrix, therefore eliminate the error introduced during the 
inversion of the frequency response matrix. It is also found from our 
study that when the airspeed and noise level increase, the force 
determination errors also rise. 
EXPERIMENT TESTINGS 
Experiment Model 
A 3D wing model with dimensions fitting the wind tunnel test was 
designed using the commercial CAD package Solid Edge (Fig. 33). The 
CAD model was then manufactured in the rapid prototype laboratory in 
University of Louisville (Fig. 34). The airfoil shape of this model is 
NACA-65A004 and its dimensions are listed in Table 3. 
In order to install accelerometers in to this model for vibration test, two

rectangular cutouts were created at the side surfaces of both ends of the 
boom. The cables that connect the accelerometers and signal amplifier 
were fed through the interior of this model in order to eliminate 
aerodynamic influence. Thus, both the wing and boom are hollow, the 
thickness of the wing model is 1mm, and an 8.2 mm × 8.5 mm space is 
available inside the boom.  
At the root of the wing, a plate is attached to fix the wing to the wind 
tunnel wall. In this plate, a helicoids hole is created to connect the model 
with the wind tunnel. The material of the wing model is Dura Form 
polyamide (PA), with Young’s modulus 1600 MPa, Poisson’s ratio 0.4, 
and density 590 kg/m3.

Vibratory Force for Aircraft Wings                        Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  107 
 
The equations of motion in the frequency domain are:  
X() = H()F()                                         (28) 
F() = H()-1X() 
 
 
 
 
      (29) 
where H(ω) is the frequency response function of the system and F(ω) is 
the actual force in the frequency domain. H(ω) is obtained from ground 
vibration testing, X(ω) is the airfoil response measured during flight, 
which can be measured by the two accelerometers mounted on the wing. 
Thus, the air-dynamic forces acting on the wing during flight can be 
identified by the experiment results. 
Experiment Setup  
The experiment setup for the wind tunnel test is the same as the previous 
test and the data were collected using the same way (Fig. 40). The speed 
of wind was measured by a Pitot gage as shown in Fig. (41). Table 5 lists 
the seven wind speeds measured by the Pitot gage in the wind tunnel.

As shown in Table 6, the percentage errors are below 10% at lower air

speeds and the errors increased with the air speed. The maximum 
percentage error for moments is 21.14%.  
CONCLUSION 
This chapter presents several force determination methods and applies 
those methods to identify the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on 
an aircraft wing model during the flight. Two wing models, a two 
degrees-of-freedom model and a multi-degree-of-freedom model are 
created and used for this study. The estimated force and moments are 
compared to the actual values. From the comparisons, it is concluded that 
with available mass, stiffness, and damping matrices, the traditional 
pseudo-inverse method provides the best accuracy. However, considering 
both accuracy and applicability, the direct determination methods “F1” 
and “F2” are recommended for such problem. Also, the accuracy of the 
created two degrees-of-freedom and multi-degree-of-freedom wing 
models are verified through this study.  
In the experimental analysis part, two tests, ground vibration test and 
wind tunnel test were performed on a rapid prototyped airfoil model. The 
model’s natural frequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes were calculated 
based on the data measured from the ground vibration test. The 
aerodynamic loadings acting on this model under different wind speeds 
were measured from the wind tunnel test and validated by comparing to 
the actual force values.

Abstract: This chapter provides a combined computational and analytical study to 
investigate the lateral impact behavior of pressurized pipelines and inspect effects of 
important parameters such as the outside diameter and internal pressure on such 
behavior. A total of more than 300 numerical simulations are carried out on mild 
steel pipe models with different internal pressure levels and were struck at the mid-span 
and at the one quarter span positions. These numerical simulations of the impact 
tests are performed using 3D dynamic nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) 
through LS-DYNA, where both geometrical and material nonlinearities are 
considered. The computational results for the first time systematically reveal the 
effects of internal pressure, impact position, and outside diameter on the lateral 
impact behavior of the pipeline models. Quartic polynomial functions are applied to 
formulate the maximum crushing force (Fmax), maximum permanent displacement 
(Wf), and absorbed energy (Ep) of the pressurized pipelines during the impact 
problem. The effects of the diameter and pressure on F, W, and E are therefore 
illustrated through analyzing those functions. Response surfaces are also plotted 
based on the generated quartic polynomial functions and the quality (accuracy) of

INTRODUCTION 
 
Dynamic responses and failure modes of pipelines subjected to 
low-velocity lateral impact were studied and described by Jones and other 
researchers [1-9] through a series of experimental and theoretical analyses. 
In Jones’ work [1-3, 9], pipelines with different sizes were fully clamped 
at both ends and a rigid indenter struck transversely at the pipe center, 
quarter span and near to the support at velocities ranging up to 14 m/s. 

Lateral Impact Behavior of Pressurized Pipelines            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  115 
Important experimental results (deformation mode, maximum permanent 
transverse displacement, threshold failure energy, etc.) were observed and 
associated with size of the pipelines, initial kinetic energy of the indenter, 
its impact velocity, and its impact position. In addition, properties of 
material of the pipelines were also considered and the influences of 
material strain hardening, strain rate sensitivity, and elasticity on the 
impact behavior of the pipelines were included in their analytical models. 
Pressurized pipelines were also tested in Jones’ and Ng’s work [8, 9] but 
the influence of internal pressure on the impact behavior of the pipelines 
has not been explicitly demonstrated. In reality, the internal pressure is a 
critical factor in the design and assessment of pipelines because in civil 
applications such as aerospace hydraulic systems, most pipelines convey 
gases and liquids under high pressures over long distances.  
In this study, the dynamic inelastic behavior of clamped thin-walled pipes 
with internal pressure impacted transversely by a rigid, knife-edge 
indenter at the pipe center and quarter span is modeled and examined 
computationally through more than 300 simulations. The obtained 
numerical results are validated by comparing to several previously 
published experimental data. Effects of internal pressure on the lateral 
impact response of the pipelines as well as influences of other impact 
conditions such as dimensions of the pipelines and impact location are 
revealed from those simulation results. An explicit FEA solver, LS-DYNA 
is employed to create the FEA models and run the numerical analyses.  
After the computational analysis, numerical methods are employed to 
establish analytical models to numerically show how the impact 
parameters (internal pressure and outside diameter) affect the impact 
response of the pipelines during low-speed lateral impact. This study 
mainly focuses on finding the effects of internal pressure and outside 
diameter on the pipeline’s impact force, deformation, and energy 
absorption capacity.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
The indenter geometry is selected as a fairly severe test of a pipeline and 
is an idealization of the edge of a flange which could be dropped 
accidentally onto a pipeline. The pressurized pipes are made from 
seamless cold drawn mild steel with outside diameters of 22, 42, 60, 80, 
100, and 120 mm with a fixed ratio of 2L/D = 10, where 2L is the 
distance between the two supports and D is the outside diameter. The 
selected ratio of 2L/D = 10 is currently being used in most research 
laboratory and industry plant as the largest unsupported pipe length ratio 
[5]. The cold worked mild steel pipes have a 2mm wall thickness, and the 
mechanical properties in the axial direction of the pipe are: static uniaxial 
yield stress σy = 663 MPa, static ultimate tensile stress σu = 823 MPa, and 
static uniaxial rupture strain εr = 6 ~ 7%. Several internal pressures will 
be applied in addition to the tests without any internal pressure in order to 
find out the influence of internal pressure on the lateral impact behavior 
of the pipelines. In this study, the internal pressure p varies from 0 to 150 
bar. Specifically, 6 different pressures, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 bar are 
applied on inner surface of the pipelines separately in order to achieve a 
complete understanding of how the internal pressure affects the lateral 
impact behavior of the pipelines.  
After simulations, important numerical data are measured or estimated in 
order to describe the plasticity mechanisms and impact behavior of the 
pressurized pipelines. Those data include Wf, the maximum permanent 
transverse displacement, Wl and Wg, local and global permanent transvers 
displacement respectively, maximum impact force Fmax and average 
impact force Fm, rebound velocity of the striker when it separates from the 
pipe vr, impact energy absorbed by the pipes Ep and the threshold failure 
energy Ef, etc. Fig. (1) defines Wf, Wl and Wg, from which the 
relationships among the three displacement components can be defined 
as: 
Wf = Wl + Wg

MATERIAL PROPERTIES 
In creating FEA models used for impact analysis that involves large strain 
and high strain rate problems, the material properties have to be carefully 
defined to correctly capture the impact. Here, elastic plastic material law 
with kinematic isotropic hardening is chosen to model the pipeline 
material (cold drawn steel). Dynamic effects of strain rates are taken into 
account by scaling static yield stress with a factor with the assumption of 
Cowper-Symonds relation [12]:

where εis the strain rate and Eq. (2) shows that during dynamic crushing, 
the original yield strength σ0 should be replaced by the dynamic flow 
stress σʹ0 due to the strain rate effects. C and P are constants of 
Cowper-Symonds relation, which are used to define the influence of 
material strain rate sensitivity in this study. 
The pipelines are made of cold drawn steel, whose material properties are

COMPUTER MODELING AND ANALYSIS 
72 FEA models were created for the pressurized pipelines and one for the 
rigid knife-edge indenter. The pipelines were modeled using 4-node 
Belytschko-Tsay shell elements with five integration points through the 
thickness. The indenter was modeled using rigid elements with rigid 
material properties assigned and its mass is set as 17.48 kg. It has the 
same shape and mass as the indenter used by Jones [9]. The contact 
between the pipelines and the indenter was defined through automatic 
surface to surface contact algorithm. Within the defined contact pair, the 
impact face on the pipeline was chosen as master contact surface and the 
impact face on the indenter the slave surface. An initial speed of 10 m/s 
was applied on the impact, at which it impacted onto the pipeline.  
Two loading curves were developed to define the internal pressure and 
gravity, which were applied onto the pipeline model as loading conditions. 
In applying the internal pressure curve, its direction was carefully selected 
so that the internal pressure was applied onto the inner side of the pipeline 

Lateral Impact Behavior of Pressurized Pipelines            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  119 
model along normal directions. For example, if the normal direction of 
the shell elements of the pipeline model is pointing outward of the wall, 
the negative value should be turned on in the LS-DYNA internal pressure 
curve card; otherwise, a positive index value has to be applied. For more 
details regarding definition and application of the internal pressure curve 
card, please refer to [12]. 
The generated FEA models include 1000 to more than 25,000 elements. 
More than 300 impact simulations were then performed on those models 
after applying appropriate boundary conditions (constraints on both ends 
of the pipelines), loading conditions (internal pressure on the pipelines), 
and initial conditions (initial velocity on the indenter). Figs. (2 and 3) 
present two impact scenarios, where the indenter impacted a pipeline 
model with outside diameter of 60 mm and internal pressure of 60 bar at 
its center and one quarter span, respectively.

FEA Results 
After the impact simulations, important FEA results were collected and 
compared, from which typical lateral impact response of the pressurized 
pipelines would be described. (Figs. 4 and 5), for example, plot the 
deformed configurations of the FEA models presented in Figs. (2 and 3), 
respectively. Some significant FEA results are recorded in Tables 2 and 3 
for pipeline models which were struck at middle and one quarter span 
position, respectively.

Some of the listed FEA results obtained from this study were compared 
with several previously published experimental results [8, 9] and a good 
agreement was achieved. Thus, the accuracy of the developed FEA 
models and proposed computational approach was validated. 
Effects of Impact Position on the Impact Response of Pipelines 
(Figs. 6 to 8) compare the histories of impact force, transverse 
deformation, and absorbed energy of the pipeline model when it was 
struck by the indenter at its center and one quarter span (Figs. 2 and 3). 
Similar results in impact force, deformation and absorbed energy can be 
found from other pipeline models with different dimensions and internal 
pressures.

Fig. (8). Comparison of absorbed energy yielded from models presented in Figs. (2 and 3). 
In order to better reveal the influence of impact position on the lateral 
impact behavior of the pipelines, six response surfaces are plotted based 
on results listed in Tables 1 and 2 and displayed in Figs. (9 to 11). In those 
displayed response surfaces, outside diameter and internal pressure are set 
as two input variables and the output result is maximum impact force, 
maximum deformation, and maximum absorbed energy, separately. Figs. 
(9a and 9b) compare the maximum impact force of the pipeline models 
struck at its center and at its one quarter span. Figs. (10a and 10b) 
compare the maximum deformation, and Figs. (11a and 11b) compare the 
maximum absorbed energy.

Effects of Internal Pressure on the Impact Response of Pipelines

Fig. (17). Maximum absorbed energy of pipeline models struck at one quarter. 
DISCUSSION ON COMPUTER RESULTS 
From Figs. (6 to 17) it can be observed that the different impact positions 
did not evidently alter the characteristic lateral impact response of the 
pressurized pipelines. The response surfaces of maximum impact force, 
displacement, and absorbed energy obtained from both impact scenarios 
showed similar shapes (Figs. 9 to 11). The influences of internal pressure 
and diameter on the impact response of those pipelines also rendered 
similar 
tendencies 
under 
both 
mid-position 
impact 
and 
one 
quarter-position impact (Figs. 12 to 17).  
However, different impact positions did affect the values of maximum 
impact force, transverse displacement, and absorbed energy. Figs. (12 and 
13) argue that the maximum impact forces yielded during the one 
quarter-position impact were apparently higher than those generated 
during the mid-position impact. This is because that the “one quarter 
position” is closer to fixture and therefore is more rigid than the “middle 
position”. Due to the same reason, the permanent transverse 
displacements yielded from the one quarter-position impact were 

Lateral Impact Behavior of Pressurized Pipelines            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  133 
significantly lower than those resulted from the mid-position impact (as 
shown in Figs. (14 and 15), which can also be well explained through the 
classic cantilever beam theory. However, as reflected from (Figs. 16 and 
17), the impact energy absorbed during the mid-position impact was 
slightly lower than that absorbed during the one quarter-position impact. 
Those computational findings agree well with the phenomena observed 
experimentally by Jones and his coworkers [1-3].  
As for the influences of the internal pressure and outside diameter, Figs. 
(12 and 13) reveal that when the internal pressure increased, the 
maximum impact force also increased, even such tendency was not 
apparent when the out diameter was low. It is believed that the internal 
pressure will enhance impact resistance of the pipeline model, therefore 
leads to higher impact forces. Meanwhile, those figures also tell us that 
under the same pressure, the pipeline models with larger outside diameter 
may be subjected to higher impact force.  
From Figs. (14 and 15) it is found that the maximum transverse 
displacement decreased with an increasing internal pressure. Similar to 
the maximum impact force, such tendency was not clear when the outside 
diameter was low. This phenomenon can also be explained through the 
improved impact resistance of the pipelines due to the increased internal 
pressure. On the other side, the total permanent transverse displacement 
Wf decreased when the outside diameter D increased. However, on 
inspecting the results listed in Tables 1 and 2, it can be seen that the 
permanent local displacement Wl did increase as the outside diameter 
increased, which can be perfectly explained using the theoretical model 
produced by Oliveira et al. [10]. 
Figs. (16 and 17) show that when the internal pressure increased, the 
impact energy absorbed by the pipelines decreased (still, such tendency 
was not that evident for pipelines with a small outside diameter). Similar 
finding was also reported in Ng and Shen’s work, which were obtained 
through experiments [8]. Since the internal pressure enhances the rigidity 
of the pipeline, that way the indenter will rebound at a comparatively high 

134  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Dou and Liu 
speed after impacting the pipeline and less impact energy will be 
absorbed by the pipeline. Meanwhile, from both figures it is observed that 
similar to the displacement case, the absorbed impact energy decreased 
when the outside diameter increased.  
ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS 
Response Surface Method (RSM) [11] 
In modern industry, RSM is extensively applied in developing, improving, 
formulating, and optimizing processes. During a design process, such 
method is used to determine potential influences of several input variables 
(independent variables) on the performance or quality of the entire system 
so as to acquire optimized responses from that system. This method has 
also been extensively applied by the author in optimum design of 
thin-walled columns in order to optimize their energy absorption capacity 
during crash analysis [12-17]. In this study, RSM is employed to 
determine how the internal pressure (p) and outside diameter (D) of the 
mild-steel pipelines affect their impact response, including impact force 
(Fmax), permanent deformation (Wf), and absorbed energy (Ep).  
In this study, the impact response of the pipelines (it can be the impact 
force, deformation, and absorbed energy) is approximated using a series 
of the basic functions in a form of

where n represents the number of basic functions φi(p, D). In this paper, 
the polynomials are used to build up these basic functions to formulate F, 
W, and E.  
In Eq. (3), the βi, known as the regression coefficients, are estimated using 
the method of least squares. Suppose we have m (m > n) observations 
(obtained from FEA) for the yielded response yi (y1 – ym) based on the m

By substituting Eq. (5) into (3), the response surface model is created and 
the response functions (F(p, D), W(p, D), and E(p, D)) then can be fully 
determined.  
The accuracy of the developed response surface model can be verified 
through several techniques. The relative error (RE) between the observed 
response at those sampling points y(x) and the original response ŷ(x) is 
RE = [ŷ(x) – y(x)]/y(x)

RSM Models and Assessment 
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, six pressures and diameters were selected for 
modeling and simulation and totally 36 combinations were presented. 
Thus, in Eq. (4) the matrix Φ has 36 rows (m = 36), which corresponds to 
the 36 combinations of p and D (No. 1 to 36 in Tables 1 and 2). In this 
study, quartic polynomial is used as the basic function because it provides 
the best fitness to the real problems [12]. Thus, the basic functions φi are 
terms in a full quartic form, which are 1, p, D, p2, pD, D2, p3, p2D, pD2, 

Lateral Impact Behavior of Pressurized Pipelines            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  137 
D3, p4, p3D, p2D2, pD3, D4. Substituting p and D values into Eq. (6), a 36 
× 15 matrix Φ then can be created.  
Next, response surface models (quartic polynomials) are created for F, W, 
and E separately. Based on the FEA results listed in Tables 1 and 2, the 
regression coefficients are determined using Eq. (7) and then the 
corresponding quaritc polynomial functions are achieved as:

The approximation of the responses obtained from the response functions 
and the FEA results are then substituted into Eqs. (8) to (13) to evaluate 
the fitness of the developed RS models. In those equations m = 36 and n = 
15 (number of basic functions in a full quartic polynomial form). The 
values of RE, R2, R2
adj, and RMSE are calculated and displayed in Table 3. 
From that table it can be seen that the R2 and R2
adj for force (mid-span), 
displacement (mid-span and one quarter span), and energy (one quarter 
span) are very close to the perfect value (1) and the values for energy 
(mid-span) and force (one quarter span) are still very high. The tabulated 
values prove that the developed quartic polynomial functions accurately 
reflect the pressurized pipeline’s responses during the lateral low speed 
impact process. Meanwhile, Table 4 also validates the selection of outside 
diameters and internal pressures over the entire design domain. The 
generated response surfaces with respect to variables p and D are plotted 
in Figs. (18 and 19).

PARAMETRIC STUDY 
Influence of Internal Pressure 
In order to reveal the effects of internal pressure on the pipelines’ lateral 
impact response, as well as validate the accuracy of the developed 
response surface models, we substitute D = 22, 42, 60, 80, 100, and 120 
into Eqs. (14 to 19) to obtain a series of simplified analytical models with 
the internal pressure p as the only variable. Curves are then plotted from 
those analytical models and compared with the results obtained from FEA 
simulations. (As displayed in Figs. 20 to 22).   (a) (b)

From above figures, it was found that the internal pressure affects the 
behavior of pressurized pipelines under both mid-span and one quarter 
span impact in similar ways. As shown in (Figs. 20a and 20b), the 
maximum impact forces yielded in the one quarter span impact are 
apparently higher than those generated during the mid-span impact. This 
is because that the “one quarter position” is closer to the fixture and 
therefore is more rigid than the “middle position”, which leads to higher 
impact force values. However, as reflected in (Figs. 22a and 22b), the 
change of impact positions does not evidently alter the energy absorbed 
during the impacts.  
Figs. (20 to 22) also reveal that when the internal pressure increases, the 
maximum impact force also increases, even such tendency is not evident 
when the outside diameter is small. Thus, it can be deduced that the 
internal pressure can enhance the impact resistance of the pipeline and 
therefore leads to higher impact forces. On the contrary, as the pressure 
increases, the impact energy absorbed by the pipelines decreases, still 
such tendency is not that clear when the outside diameter of the pipelines 
is small. Since the internal pressure improves the overall impact 
resistance of the pipeline model, therefore after impacting a pipeline with 
higher internal pressure, the indenter will rebound at a higher speed and 
only small portion of impact energy will be absorbed by the pipeline itself. 
These findings agree very well with the results presented in ng and shen’s 
work [8], who drawn similar conclusions through a series of impact tests 
and experimental analysis.  
INFLUENCE OF OUTSIDE DIAMETER 
Similarly, in order to study the effects of outside diameter on the pipelines’ 
lateral impact response, p = 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 are substituted into 
Eqs. (14-19) separately to create a series of analytical models with the 
outside diameter as the only variable. Those analytical models are then 
compared with the FEA results and the comparison results are shown in 
Figs. (23 to 25).

At first, it was observed that just like the internal pressure, the outside 
diameter affects the behavior of the pipeline models impacted at two 
positions in similar ways. From above figures, it was found that the 
internal pressure affects the behavior of pressurized pipelines under both 
mid-span and one quarter span impact in similar ways. As illustrated in 
Figs. (20 and 22), it is verified in Figs. (23 and 25) that the maximum 
impact forces yielded in the one quarter span impact are higher than those 
generated during the mid-span impact, and the energy absorbed in both 
cases are very close to each other. 
 
From Fig. (23a and 23b), it can be seen that as the outside diameter 
increases, the maximum impact forces also increases for most internal 
pressures. Exceptions were however observed at low internal pressures. 
For mid-space impacts, when the internal pressure is lower than 30 bar, 
the maximum impact force value goes down when the outside diameter 
exceeds 100 mm. For the one quarter span impacts, the increasing 
tendency of the maximum force value becomes much less apparent when 
the internal pressure is 30 bar and the outside diameter passes 80 mm, and 
when the internal pressure is 60 bar and the outside diameter reaches 100 
mm. Furthermore, for pipelines without internal pressure, the maximum 
force starts decreasing when the outside diameter reaches 60 mm. As 
reflected in Fig. (25a and 25b), when the outside diameter increases, the 
energy absorbed by the pipelines decreases and the decreasing tendency is 
much more obvious than the decreasing caused by the increasing internal 
pressure (Fig. 22a and 22b). In summary, the influence of the outside 
diameter on pressurized pipelines’ impact behavior is similar to that of the 
internal pressure, both of them will enhance impact resistance of the 
pipeline models.  
CONCLUSION 
In this chapter, the lateral impact behavior of pressurized pipelines is 
studied through a series of numerical simulations and analytical analyses. 
72 FEA models were created and more than 300 simulations were 

Lateral Impact Behavior of Pressurized Pipelines            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  149 
performed to simulate that the pressurized pipelines with different 
dimensions and different internal pressures applied were struck at the 
mid-span and at the one quarter span positions. Effects of impact position, 
outside diameter, and internal pressure on the lateral impact behavior of 
the pressurized pipelines are demonstrated based on the FEA results and 
RS models, which can be described as follows: 
1. The different impact positions do not evidently affect the 
characteristics of lateral impact response of the pressurized 
pipelines. 
2. The maximum impact force yielded during the mid-position 
impact is lower than that produced during the one quarter-position 
impact; the permanent transverse displacements caused by 
mid-position impact is apparently higher than that resulted from 
the mid-position impact; while the energy absorbed during the 
mid-position impact was slightly lower than that absorbed during 
the one quarter-position impact.  
3. When the internal pressure increases, the maximum impact force 
increases, the maximum transverse displacement decreases, and 
the absorbed impact energy decreases also. 
4. When the outside diameter increases, the maximum impact force 
increases, the maximum transverse displacement decreases, and 
the absorbed impact energy decreases also. 
5. The internal pressure shows less influence on the lateral impact 
response of the pipelines with smaller outside diameter.  
Based on the outcomes of this study, it is expected that a complete 
understanding of plasticity mechanisms that govern the impact of the 
pressurized pipelines can be fully obtained by implementing the proposed 
research plans. In addition, the present computational and analytical 
approaches will propel the research in safety and reliability of low 
pressure pipelines, which are used in hydraulic system of aerospace.

Abstract: A number of existing and emerging industrial applications are dependent 
on layered substrates through adhesive bonding. The interfacial fracture of 
adhesively bonded structures is a critical issue for their extensive applications to a 
variety of modern industries. In the recent two decades, cohesive zone models 
(CZMs) have been receiving intensive attentions for fracture problems in adhesively 
bonded joints due to its fairly simple and accurate predictive ability. In CZMs the 
nonlinear interfacial fracture behaviors are described by the traction-separation laws 
(also referred to as cohesive laws). The cohesive laws represent the local constitutive 
behavior, instead of the global parameter, such as toughness. While numerous global 
tests have been conducted to measure the interfacial toughness of adhesive joints, 
limited local tests have been conducted to determine the interfacial traction- 
separation laws or interfacial cohesive laws. Among the limited local tests in some 
recent experimental studies, very few studies have considered the effects of adhesive 
thickness on the local interfacial traction-separation laws. In the present work, within

the framework of nonlinear fracture mechanics, comprehensive experimental 
studies are conducted to investigate the effect of adhesive layer thickness on the 
local nonlinear interfacial behaviors. The fracture tests of adhesive joints with 
various adhesive layer thicknesses were conducted under different fracture modes: 
pure Mode-I (peel fracture), pure Mode-II (shear fracture), and mixed Mode I/II. 
The experimentally determined interfacial traction-separation laws provide 
valuable baseline data for parameter calibrations in numerical models. The current 
experimental results may also facilitate the understanding of adhesive thickness 
dependent interface fracture of bonded joints.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Background 
 
Adhesive Bonding Technology 
 
The most primitive form of adhesive bonding technology can be traced 
back to 200,000 BC when hominins in central Italy glued spear stone flakes 
to a wood with birch-bark-tar [1]. Today adhesive bonding technology has 
been used in a wide variety of modern industries, such as automotive, 
aerospace, marine, construction, and military. Many components and 
structures, from microchips to large aircrafts, are made of materials 
arranged in layers through adhesive bonding [2]. 
The strength of attachment, or adhesion, between an adhesive and its 
substrate depends on the mechanisms of adhesion and the surface area 
over which the two materials contact. The mechanisms of adhesion can be 
categorized as mechanical, chemical, dispersive, electrostatic, or diffusive. 
Mechanical adhesion occurs when adhesive materials fill the voids or 
pores of the surfaces and the surfaces are held together by interlocking; 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  155 
chemical adhesion is developed when the two materials form a compound 
at the joint; dispersive adhesion is realized through the attraction between 
two molecules with regions of slight positive and negative charge (i.e., 
van der Waals forces); electrostatic adhesion happens when some 
conducting materials pass electrons to form a difference in electrical 
charge at the joint; finally, diffusive adhesion is realized when the 
molecules of both materials are mobile and soluble in each other and 
merge at the joint by diffusion [3]. 
 
Three Basic Modes of Fracture  
Failure of the adhesive joint imposes a major threat to the reliability of 
adhesively bonded structures. There are three basic modes of fracture, 
which are opening (mode I), shear (mode II), and tearing (mode III), as 
shown in Fig. (1.1). A fracture is considered as Mode I when the tensile 
stress is normal to the plane of the crack. When the shear stress acts 
parallel to the plane of the crack and perpendicular to the crack front, the 
fracture is considered Mode II. Mode III is characterized by a shear stress 
acting parallel to the plane of the crack and parallel to the crack font. In 
reality, however, all three modes occur simultaneously. In other words, it 
is a mixed mode.

156  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                              Ji et al. 
Classical Fracture Mechanics  
During the World War I, many steel structures failed at low temperature. 
English aeronautical engineer, A. A. Griffith, provided a theory to explain 
the failure of brittle materials and built up the fundamental research of the 
Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics [5]. A major limitation of Griffith’s 
theory is that it assumes infinite stress at the initial crack tip point as the 
radius “r” approaches zero. This is impossible in reality. Therefore, in 
1954, Irwin modified the Griffith theory and proposed a plastic zone 
developed from the initial crack tip. As the applied load increases, the 
plastic zone increases in size until the crack grows and the material 
behind the crack tip unloads. The plastic loading and unloading cycle near 
the crack tip leads to the dissipation of energy as heat. Hence, a 
dissipative term has to be added to the energy balance relation devised by 
Griffith for brittle materials. In physical terms, additional energy is 
needed for crack growth in ductile materials when compared to brittle 
materials [6]. However, one basic assumption in Irwin's linear elastic 
fracture mechanics is that the size of the plastic zone is small compared to 
the crack length. This assumption is quite restrictive for certain types of 
failure in structural steels though such steels can be prone to brittle 
fracture, which has led to a number of catastrophic failures [6]. 
In the following three decades, numerous studies had been contributed to 
failure problems of bonded joints [7]. During this stage, most efforts were 
focused on the classical linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The 
advantage of LEFM lies in the obvious simplicity and decent accuracy, 
especially for relatively brittle materials and interfaces. Within the 
framework of LEFM, the remote loadings can be correlated to the critical 
conditions (crack growth) by a local parameter: stress intensity factor (SIF) 
or a global parameter: strain energy release rate (ERR). Despite the huge 
success of LEFM, the assumption of small-scale yielding beyond the crack 
tip has been identified as one of the major limitations. Specifically, with the 
increased use of modern toughened adhesives, the cohesive fracture

associated with plastic zones along the adhesive interlayer, in many cases, 
could be comparable to or even larger than the thickness of the adherends.  
Nonlinear Fracture Mechanics 
Cohesive Zone Method 
Motivated by this limitation of LEFM, a number of efforts have been 
made along the direction of nonlinear fracture mechanics (NLFM). In the 
late 1950s and early 1960s, Barrenblatt [8] and Dugdale [9] independently 
proposed the concept of cohesive zone. Specifically, the stresses across a 
potential crack path were bounded, and a localized traction-separation law 
may be able to describe the fracture behaviors within the cohesive 
processing zone ahead of the apparent crack tip, as shown in Fig. (1.2).  
 
Fig. (1.2). Cohesive zone at mode I test. 
The stresses vary with the relative surface separations according to the 
assumed interface law during the fracture process.  
 
J-Integral  
Also during this period of time, Rice [10] proposed a path independent 
integral method to calculate the energy release rate (ERR), which is 
referred to as the well-known J-integral:  

158  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                              Ji et al.

directions, T=

is the traction vector; n is the normal to the curve or 
path Γ, σ is the Cauchy stress, and u is the displacement vector [10]. 
  
This method can describe the case when there is sufficient crack-tip 
deformation and the part no longer obeys the linear-elastic approximation. 
Rice's analysis, which assumes non-linear elastic (or monotonic 
deformation-theory plastic) deformation ahead of the crack tip, is 
designated as the J integral [10]. This analysis is limited to some 
situations. First, plastic deformation at the crack tip cannot extend to the 
furthest edge of the loaded part. Second, the assumed non-linear elastic 
behavior of the material is a reasonable approximation in shape and 
magnitude to the real material's load response. Also note that the J 
integral approach can be reduced to the Griffith theory for linear-elastic 
behavior [10]. This method can measure the ductile material with plastic 
deformation. Therefore, it can be used in this study to measure the 
fracture energy of adhesive layer.  
Application of CZM in Adhesive Joint 
Encouraged by these two achievements, intensive studies have been 
conducted to investigate the nonlinear fracture behaviors of adhesively 
bonded joints in the past three decades. The1990s might be the most 
rapidly developing period of CZMs. The realistic demands for nonlinear 
simulation become urgent due to the wide applications of modern 
toughened adhesive. With such a situation, the classical LEFM, which is 
basically a single-parameter method, may have difficulties of meeting the 
increased demands in the accurate fracture simulations and predictions. 
Instead of the single-parameter model in LEFM, it has been reported that 
two or even three parameters were needed in CZMs for the sake of 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  159 
accurate modeling. For instance, these constitutive parameters could be 
chosen as the fracture toughness JIC/JIIC, the cohesive strength σmax/τmax 
and/or the characteristic length δ at which the cohesive tractions vanish [2, 
11, 12].  
Various cohesive zone models (cohesive laws) were proposed to model 
the fracture process [13-18]. The main difference between these models 
lies in the shape of the traction-displacement response, and the parameters 
used to describe that shape. All of them start from the assumption that one 
or more interfaces can be defined, where crack propagation is allowed by 
the introduction of a possible discontinuity in the displacement field. One 
feature of CZMs is that they can be conveniently incorporated in the 
traditional finite element analysis (FEA) to model the fracture behaviors 
in various materials and structures, including adhesive joints [13, 15-31]. 
It is worth noting that CZMs can be also incorporated in analytical 
models to derive the theoretical solutions for some types of specimens or 
structures with relatively simple geometries [2, 12, 32-39]. 
Although CZM based methods showed considerable difference, all 
parameters required calibrations by test data. Importantly, due to the 
effects of adhesive thickness on plastic dissipations, calibrations are 
highly preferred to be conducted with different thicknesses of adhesive 
layer. There might be two means for the parameter characterizations: 
global method and local method. For the global method, one may 
compare measured global loadings, deflections and toughnesses to those 
by numerical models embedded with the parameters to be calibrated, at 
different adhesive thicknesses. The global behaviors of bonded joints have 
been widely tested with different adhesive thicknesses [3, 26, 40-46], to 
name a few. Their study clearly showed that the fracture energy varies 
with the thickness of the adhesive layer. On the contrary, fewer attentions 
have been paid to the local test on the interfacial traction-separation laws 
across the interlayer. However, this is also a quite important issue. First, it 
may provide direct thickness-dependent equivalent interfacial laws for 

160  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                              Ji et al. 
simple models. Meanwhile, it can cross-calibrate the parameters required 
by the “CZM+elastoplastic continuum” model. One may argue that global 
tests are sufficiently good to calibrate the parameters. It is believed that 
the local separation between the two adherends may be even a more direct, 
rigorous and reliable means to calibrate the parameters in a numerical 
model. 
  
Several local experimental tests have been conducted on the local 
interfacial traction-separation laws for bonded joints. For instance, 
Søensen [47] and Andersson and Stigh [48] experimentally determined 
the interfacial traction-separation laws of bonded joint under Mode-I 
loadings. Andersson and Biel [49] and Leffler et al. [50] experimentally 
obtained the interfacial traction-separation law of bonded joint under 
Mode-II loadings. Recently, interfacial traction-separation laws were also 
tested under mixed mode loadings [27]. Most recently, Zhu et al. [51] 
conducted a local fracture test to extract the loading rate-dependent 
traction–separation laws. 
 
The Mode II, or in-plane interface shear fracture, loading mode is also of 
particular importance for adhesive joints [33]. Mode II loading may be 
induced when a cracked adhesive joint or a layered composite is subjected 
to bending. The various experimental fracture mechanics approaches to 
Mode II usually utilize some form of test specimen which is subjected to 
applied bending loads in order to determine the values of the Mode II 
toughness GIIC [52]. 
 
To measure the Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness, Russell and 
Street [53] introduced the customary end notched flexure (ENF) test, a 
three-point bending test. The compliance in bending is measured at 
several positions of the crack front with respect to the loading pin, and the 
load for the crack growth is determined for one definite crack position. 
The critical interlaminar fracture toughness is computed using the linear 
elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) combined with data reduction 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  161 
techniques.  
One of the main problems that have been encountered with Mode II 
loading has been the poor reproducibility of the values of the measured 
Mode II toughness GIIC [54]. The experimental loading-unloading cycling 
test conducted by Russel and Street [53] indicated a maximum error of 
around 2% in GIIC in composites if friction was ignored. More recently, 
Davidson and Sun [55] and Davidson et al. [56] considered the effects of 
friction in the ENF specimen and 4-ENF tests were conducted on 
composites. They concluded that friction accounted for only about 2% 
and 5%, respectively, of the measured values of GIIC from their tests. The 
effects of friction in the specimen could be a possible reason for this poor 
reproducibility. 
Another possible major cause of scatter and inconsistency in Mode II 
toughness may be a difficulty in determining the location of the crack tip 
according to some recent studies [57-59]. The difficulty in determining 
the true crack length has also been observed during Mode I peel tests in 
composites when extensive fiber-bridging and microcracking occurs. This 
has been shown to cause variations and errors in the calculation of 
toughness when corrected beam theory was employed [58].  
Additionally, numerous studies in the past several decades revealed an 
important experimental phenomenon: the global fracture behaviors are 
dependent on the loading modes [3, 19-21, 27, 41]. For instance, the 
toughness of Mode-I is usually much less than that of Mode-II, while 
those of mixed modes are between them depending on mode mixities. 
Although there are still arguments regarding the mechanism of fracture 
mode dependence, one thing for sure is that the independent fracture tests 
under pure Mode-I and Mode-II loading conditions will facilitate the 
understanding of the mode dependent phenomenon by eliminating the 
coupling of stress and plastic dissipation.  

162  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                              Ji et al. 
Some local tests have been conducted to measure the critical CZM 
parameters. For instance, with J-integral based form, the local interfacial 
traction-separation laws were experimentally tested under pure Mode-I 
and pure Mode-II loading conditions [47, 48, 50]. It is noted that these 
studies focused on the interface fracture of bonded joints with identical 
adherends through standard fracture test methods (for instance, double 
cantilever beam (DCB) and end notched fracture (ENF). Recently, an 
experimental study was also conducted to investigate the local mixed 
mode interfacial constitutive behaviors [27]. Most recently, Zhu et al. [51] 
conducted a local fracture test to extract the loading-rate dependent 
traction–separation laws. These recent efforts on the local test of interfacial 
traction-separation and traction-slipping laws across the adhesive interlayer 
provided valuable information.  
Effects of Adhesive Thickness 
Interfacial laws became dependent on the geometries, such as thickness of 
the adherend and adhesive. Because they can affect the size of plastic 
zone and the magnitude of plastic strain, they change the equivalent 
interfacial traction-separation laws. 
  
In load-bearing structures, the adhesive layers are usually weaker than the 
adherends. Therefore, the adherends can be treated as rigid constraints on 
the adhesive layer. This means that the region where a crack can 
propagate is almost in a state of prescribed deformation [49]. During 
crack propagation, a zone where the adhesive is damaged precedes the 
crack tip. This zone is denoted as the damage zone. With a tough 
engineering adhesive, it is substantially longer than it appeared in a bulk 
test and typically several times larger than the thickness of the layer [49]. 
Thus, fracture behavior depends on the thickness of the adhesive layer. 
The fracture energy for a specific adhesive can reach a maximum value at 
a certain layer thickness [3, 40]. Therefore, the effect of adhesive 
thickness is a very important parameter to design the safety factor of 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  163 
structure. 
  
However, this parameter still lack of sufficient research and attention. 
These recent efforts on the local test of interfacial traction-separation laws 
across the adhesive interlayer provided valuable information. Most of 
them were conducted with a fixed thickness of adhesive layer. As 
discussed before, in order to more efficiently calibrate the parameters, the 
local traction-separation laws tests may be desired with different adhesive 
thicknesses. However, very few tests have been conducted on the 
thickness-dependent local interfacial traction-separation laws. Among the 
very few local tests regarding effects of adhesive thickness, Kafkalidis et 
al. [43] investigated the interfacial fracture by considering three different 
thicknesses of adhesive layer and Søensen [47] tested two thicknesses. 
  
Research Objectives  
The purpose of the present work is thus to conduct a systematic study on 
the effects of adhesive thickness and obtain an entire picture about its 
effects by using Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test, End Notched 
Flexure (ENF) test, and Single Leg Bending (SLB) test with different 
thicknesses of adhesive layer. Not only its effects on the fracture energy, 
but also its effects on the local interfacial traction-separation laws are 
investigated.  
In order to reduce the workload, the thickness of the adherend remains 
identical in this work. The thickness of steel adherends is designed to be 
relatively thick to prevent from any plastic deformation. Thus, all the 
nonlinear behaviors are limited in the adhesive interlayer. For the cases 
that plastic deformations are involved in the adherends, one may refer to 
the studies [22, 23, 60]. Both local and global test are conducted 
simultaneously. With these test results, the dependency of the interface 
strength and the shape of the constitutive laws on adhesive thickness can 
be revealed. The current test results may provide valuable test data for the

research communities and facilitate the characterization of the parameters 
required by the CZM based numerical methods discussed before. 
 
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
 
Current design approaches for predicting the fracture of adhesively-bonded 
materials are still somewhat empirical, and improving these approaches is a 
critical issue for furthering the engineering applications of this technology. 
Before the physical macro-crack is formed, these two surfaces are held 
together by traction within a cohesive zone. The interfacial stresses vary 
according to the relative displacement of the surfaces, and an interface 
cohesive law describes the activities in the cohesive zone in terms of the 
separation and the traction of the interface to be formed during the fracture 
process. The fracture process of most layered or bonded structures is 
commonly under the control of mixed mode cracking combined with mode 
I and mode II component. Under mixed mode cracking, the failure process 
zone is subjected to both normal (mode I) and shear stresses (mode II). In 
order to investigate the mixed mode interface fracture of bonded joints, 
pure Mode I and pure Mode II fracture will be studied, respectively. 
  
This chapter focuses on developing a theoretical model which is able to 
characterize the nonlinear interface laws for pure Mode I, pure Mode II and 
mixed mode interface fracture test. With this developed model, the effects 
of adhesive thickness on global and local interface fracture behaviors can 
be revealed under different loading conditions. 
  
In this theoretical model, it is assumed that the crack opens in a monotonic 
fashion; neither unloading nor crack closure is permitted and the cohesive 
(or bridging) laws are assumed to be the same for each point along the bond 
length. Since the cohesive stresses represent the failure process zone, it may 
be also reasonable to assume that a certain crack opening exists, at which 
the cohesive stresses vanish when the failure criterion is satisfied. The 
classical beam theory is adapted for the adherends in adhesive joints. 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  165 
Meanwhile, it is assumed that the thickness of adhesive layer is very thin 
compared to that of the adherends. It is also assumed that the bond length is 
sufficiently long for all adhesively bonded joints. 
 
Theoretical Derivations 
Let’s consider an infinitesimal section of two adherends bonded with a thin 
adhesive layer as shown in Fig. (2.1). It is noted that this infinitesimal 
section is located within the bonded length. With the classical beam theory, 
the displacements field of the two beams U(x, z) and W(x, z) have the form

It is worth noting that Eq. (2.24) represents the governing equation of 
interfacial shear behaviors, while Eq. (2.25) represents the governing 
equation of interfacial peel behaviors. It is also noted that if only: (i) the 
resultant shear force QT in the two adherends is a constant or piecewisely 
constant within the bonded length; and (ii) the two adherends are 
identical. 
  
J- Integral for Interface Shear Behaviors 
Strictly, the adhesive material must be nonlinearly elastic during the test. 
However, for a monotonic loading process (no unloading occurs), the 
cohesive separation as well as plastic dissipation in the adhesive layer

where δʹm represents the derivative of δ=0, and δm represents the value of 
δ when dδ/dx=0. 
  
It should be noticed that the integral limits on both sides of Eq. (2.29) 
must be corresponded to each other. However, when the joint’s overlap 
length and the length between the support and concentrated middle load 
are sufficiently long relative to the cohesive zone, we may approximate 
the solution with δm→0 and δʹm →0.

Therefore, for the specimens with sufficiently long bond length, by 
denoting the tangential cohesive slip at the crack tip by δ0, Eq. (2.29) can 
be reduced to,

The value of δʹ0 at the crack tip can be readily determined as a function of 
the external forces, bending moments through global analysis as described 
by Eq. (2.12). In other words, once the crack tip slip δ0 is experimentally 
measured, the mode II energy release rate JII is then determined. 
  
J- Integral for Interface Peel Behaviors 
Similar to the discussion in interface tangential behavior, let us consider 
an arbitrary normal cohesive law σ=σ(w). It can be observed that the 
governing Eq. (2.25) is equivalent to the equation as follow,

Let us denote the beam’s rotations by θi (i=1, 2) for adherend 1 and

Determination of Interface Cohesive Laws 
It is important to note that the interfacial separation w and δ represent the 
normal opening and tangential slip between the bottom fiber of the upper 
adherend and the top fiber of the lower adherend. A typical nonlinear 
equivalent cohesive law is shown in Fig. (2.2). For most CZMs in the 
literature, the traction-separation laws are such that with increasing 
interfacial separation, the traction across the interface reaches a maximum, 
then decreases and eventually vanishes. This typical nonlinear 
separation-traction law has three segments: (a) elastic stage when the 
normal interfacial separation δ≤δ0. The normal interfacial stress σ 
increases with separation until the maximum interfacial stress σmax 
(interfacial strength) is reached; (b) softening stage when δ0≤δ≤δf. The 
normal traction σ decreases with separation δ; and (c) complete debonding 
stage. There is no interfacial stress when δ≥δf. By conducting the fracture 
tests with different adhesive thicknesses, the effects of adhesive layer on 
the constitutive laws, such as the interfacial strength, shape of the 
interfacial traction-separation law, and fracture energy can be revealed.

We shall discuss more details regarding how to measure the cohesive laws 
in the next section. Meanwhile, it is noted that this interface constitutive 
relationship is the equivalent interface cohesive law, not necessarily the 
intrinsic cohesive law. This is because in addition to the intrinsic cohesive 
separation, possible plastic deformations in the adhesive layer contribute 
to the entire separation between the two adherends during the fracture test.

Fracture Tests by DCB, ENF and SLB Specimens  
By this point, the general theoretical models have been derived for the 
interface peel behavior or normal separation (Mode-I fracture) and the 
interface shear behavior or tangential slip (Mode-II fracture). It is worth 
noting that the derived model can be also applied to the in-plane mixed 

174  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                              Ji et al. 
mode fracture (Mode I/II fracture) only if the two adherends are identical.  
However, as mentioned before, the specific formula might be different for 
different fracture test configurations due to the different boundary 
conditions. Therefore, in the work, three common standard fracture test 
methods: double cantilever beam (DCB), end notched flexure (ENF) and 
single leg bending (SLB) are adopted for Mode-I, Mode-II and in-plane 
mixed Mode I/II, respectively. 
  
DCB Specimens for Mode-I Fracture Test 
DCB specimens have been widely adopted to investigate the pure Mode-I 
interface fracture of bonded joints in previous studies [2, 3, 16-18, 21, 26, 
41-48, 61].  
Consider a typical double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen as shown in Fig. 
(2.3). It is assumed that the adherends are linearly elastic during the entire 
fracture test process. A thin adhesive layer is used to bond the two 
adherends.

concept: relative rotation θP, which reflects the relative rotation between 
the two beams at the cross section of loadline.

ENF Specimens for Mode-II Fracture Test 
End notched flexure (ENF) specimens have been widely applied to 
investigate the pure Mode-II interface fracture of bonded joints [35, 48].  
Consider a typical end notched flexure (ENF) specimen as shown in Fig. 
(2.4). It is assumed that the adherends are linearly elastic during the entire 
fracture test process. A thin adhesive layer is used to bond the two 
adherends.  
 
Fig. (2.4). Schematic of ENF specimen test. 
Obviously, with the ENF configuration, the resultant shear force QT in the 
section from left support to the mid-span loading P is a constant. Let’s 
assume that the shear forces in the upper and lower beam at the cross 
section of crack tip are Q1 and Q2, respectively. Evidently, Q1 and Q2 will 
not vary within the region from the left support to the cross section of the 
crack tip.  
Since the axial forces N1=N2=0 at the cross section of crack tip, with Eq.

SLB Specimens for Mixed Mode I/II Fracture Test 
Single leg bending (SLB) specimens have been widely applied to 
investigate the in-plane mixed Mode I/II interface fracture of bonded joints 
in previous studies.  Let’s consider a typical SLB specimen as shown in 
Fig. (2.5). It is noted that for the SLB specimen, both Mode-I fracture 
component and Mode-II fracture component exist. Therefore, we will give 
the formula for JI and JII, as well as the corresponding formula for interface

Note that for the SLB specimen, the resultant MT at the cross section of

specimen, let’s recall Eq. (2.34). Meanwhile, for SLB specimen, M1 = QT .a

where θP is the relative rotation between the two beams at the loadline. It 
is worth noting that in a real experimental SLB, it is not convenient to 
measure the rotation of lower beam’s rotation at the loadline due to the 
presence of the support, neither at the crack tip. However, one may simply 
choose any location between the crack tip and support where is more 
convenient, since the lower beam’s rotations within this region are 
identical.

obtained). Then, the interface shear stress τ (δ0) and interface normal

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
Raw Material  
Adhesive Material 
The adhesive, LOCTITE Hysol 9460, is a modified structural epoxy 
adhesive. This material has high peel strength, good impact resistance, 
and good fatigue resistance. The mix ratio of resin and hardener is 1:1 by 
weight. According to the manufacturer, its elastic modulus, tensile 
strength and elongation at break are 2.76 GPa, 30.3 MPa and 3.5%, 
respectively. The glass transition temperature is 68oC. 
 
Adherends Material  
General purpose 1018 low carbon steel bars with yield strength of 372.3 
MPa and elastic modulus of 209 GPa were used to fabricate metal based 
adherends of Double Cantilever Beam (DCB), End Notched Flexure (ENF), 
and Single Leg Bending (SLB) specimens. Before the adhesive was applied, 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  181 
the surface of the adherends were grounded by sand paper, and then cleaned 
by using acetone. 
Fabrication of Specimen 
There are two different methods to manufacture the DCBs. One is that the 
adherends are cut before the adhesive curing processes. The other one is 
that the two adherends with adhesive experience the curing processes and 
then are cut to small DCB specimens. The major problem of this method is 
that during the milling and cutting processes, the adhesive layer could be 
damaged by metal chips. Therefore, this study cut the adherends before 
bonding them with adhesive. 
The thickness of the adherends was measured before the adhesive was 
applied and compared with the thickness of the specimen after curing. In 
order to obtain different and desirable thickness of the adhesive layer, six 
different thickness feeler gage inserts were inserted in between the two 
adherends. The feeler gages can also control the edge of the adhesive and 
help in keeping the adherends parallel. It is also noted that the surface of the 
feeler gauges were sprayed with a super-thin layer of mold release agent so 
that the feeler gauges could be easily removed after the curing. 
A very thin mylar tape with thickness of 0.035 mm was carefully inserted 
from the edge of adhesive layer by 2 mm at the middle height of the 
adhesive layer immediately after the application of the adhesive layer to 
create a sharp initial crack, as shown in Fig. (3.1).    

182  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                              Ji et al. 
 
Fig. (3.1). microscope image shows the inserted 0.035 mm thick mylar sheet located at the middle 
plane of the adhesive layer. 
The prepared specimens were then pressed by the same weights and cured 
for 24 hours at room temperature. The specimens were further put into an 
oven at 60.5oC (141oF) for 1 hour for post-curing. After that, they were 
cooled down to room temperature before test. 
Steel Based DCB Specimen for Mode I Test 
The actual average adhesive thicknesses of the six groups of specimens 
were 0.09 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.8 mm, and 1.0 mm. After 
cutting, a hole (11.11mm in diameter), which was 50.8 mm from one end of 
the adherend, was drilled coaxially in the upper and lower adherends and 
coaxially machined threads inside the hole to apply the peel load using our 
specially designed loading fixture as will be discussed later. Once the 
surface of the adherends was cleaned by using acetone, the adherends were 
ready for preparing the DCB specimens, as shown in Fig. (3.2).

Since the distance between the loadline and the edge of the adhesive layer is 
50 mm, the total initial crack length “a” is 52mm. The geometry 
information of each group of specimens was given in Table 3.1. After the 
adhesive was applied, a steel pin with the same diameter as the threaded 
hole was inserted into the hole to hold the adherends in place.

After curing, the wire shape feeler gages with relevant thickness were 
inserted to the end of the specimen. Therefore, during the three-point

One end of the ball pin with threads was mated with the prefabricated 
threads within the holes in the test specimen, and the other end was 
connected with the MTS machine. The ball pin had an ability to rotate 360o 
in the XZ plane and 30o to -30o in the XY and YZ planes. 
 
Instrumentation and Test Method 
The MTS 810 machine was used to conduct the test and collect the loading 
force data “P” and the displacement “Δ” of the DCB specimens at the 
loading point. The fracture test was conducted under the displacement

controlled mode. The loading rate was set as 1 µm/s and the data collecting 
frequency was 1 Hz. 
   
In order to measure the rotating angle “θ” of the adherends during the peel 
test, a digital inclinometer and sensor were attached at the free end of the 
adherends to collect the data during the test. The accuracy of the 
inclinometer is 0.01o. The test range is from -70o to 70o. The data 
acquisition frequency is 1 Hz. 
 
Sony XCD-CR90 High resolution CCD camera with a resolution of 
3.7×3.7 µm/pixel was used in this experiment. The position of the camera 
was adjusted to be perpendicular to the side of the test specimen and the 
deformation images of test specimen during the test was shot, with focus on 
the adhesive layer. The camera shooting rate was 1 Hz. The collected 
images were input to an image processing toolkit, ImageJ, to post-analyze 
the recorded images and thus obtained the local separation of the crack tip 
“δ”. The Mode I, Mode II, and Mixed Mode (Mode I/ Mode II) test setup 
was shown in Figs. (3.6 - 3.8), respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF MODE I TEST 
This section includes two parts: one is the results and discussion based on 
the Mode I test data of steel adherends DCB specimens; the other is based 
on the data of laminated composite DCB Specimens. 
Results and Discussions of Mode I Test  
Global Test Results 
The loading rate (at loading point) was equal to 1 µm/s. The preliminary 
studies showed that this rate could lead to a very stable descending branch 
when the crack was propagated, and it could be safely treated as a 
quasistatic loading condition. In the current study, a total of six groups of 
specimens which were numbered from group 1 to group 6 for the average 
adhesive thicknesses of 0.09 mm, 0.2mm, 0.4mm, 0.6mm, 0.8mm, and 
1mm, respectively, were prepared and tested. Each group had 5 effective 
specimens, and a total of 30 effective specimens experienced the double 
cantilever beam (DCB) test by using the MTS 810 machine. The geometric 
parameters of each specimen have been given in Table 3.1. Based on the 
analytical results of Ouyang and Li [2], with the current geometric 
configuration and the experimental data, it was found that all adherends 
(tool-grade steel) remained linear elastic during the entire test process 
without any plastic deformation. This indicates that all energy dissipations 
were contributed by cohesive fracture and the plastic dissipations in the 
adhesive layer. A typical force vs. displacement curve (a specimen in group 
2 with an adhesive thickness of 0.2 mm) at the loading point is shown in Fig. 
(4.1).  
The force linearly increased until the local damage occurs. The load 
nonlinearly increases until the crack initiation process is completed. After 
that, the crack tip starts propagating. A continuous drop in the peel force 
was seen as the crack continuously propagated until the crack reached the 
DCB specimen’s end.

Fig. (4.1). A typical relationship between loadline displacements Δ and loadline peel force P for 
Group 2 (ha=0.2mm). 
Although there was no TEM, AFM or spectroscopy (XPS) examination of 
the morphology of fractured surfaces, with the help of high resolution 
microscope, it was found that the failure mode is cohesive fracture for all 
cases. Even for the thinnest adhesive layer of 90µm, an extremely thin 
adhesive layer was remained on the surfaces of the two separated 
adherends. It was thus believed that even for the thinnest layers, failure 
mode is still in the form of cohesive fracture instead of adhesive failure. 
This failure mode may be because careful surface cleaning and treatment 
were conducted during the specimen preparation associated with the good 
bonding between the adhesive and adherends. 
 
The data of the rotation angel at the loading point were collected by the 
inclinometer. A typical experimental curve between the rotation angle θP at 
the loadline and the displacement Δ at the loadline (a specimen in group 2 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  191 
with thickness of 0.2 mm) is shown in Fig. (4.2). With Eq. (2.41), the 
experimental energy release rate J is determined by combining the 
measured θP and P (or combining Figs. 4.1 and 4.2). A typical relationship 
(a specimen in group 2 with thickness of 0.2 mm) between global energy 
release rate J and loadline displacement Δ is given in Fig. (4.3). In a real test, 
we found that it was fairly difficult to exactly define when the initial crack 
tip was propagated. Therefore, a characteristic strain energy release rate J0 
was defined which represented the J value when the maximum peel force P 
was reached. Note that with the growth of the crack, the global strain energy 
release rate keeps increasing as shown in Fig. (4.3) (J-Δ curve). This 
implies that the plastic dissipations beyond the crack tip must keep 
increasing during this stable growth process. However, the increase rate of J 
becomes slower and slower as the crack grows, which seems nearly stable 
even by the end of the test. Therefore, an approximate asymptote is added in 
Fig. (4.3) to estimate the interfacial toughness of the bonded joints. And this 
estimated asymptotic value is denoted by JC or fracture energy.

Local Test Results 
In this study, crack tip local deformations along the entire adhesive layer 
were recorded using high resolution CCD camera. It was also observed 
that a whitening zone appeared near the initial crack tip and was 
becoming more visible as the load was increased, as shown in Fig. (4.4).

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  193 
It was believed that the whitening zone consisted of numerous micro- 
cracks. When a lot of micro cracks were merged together and formed a 
macro crack, the initial crack started to propagate with the continuously 
increasing load. Digital images of the displacement field at the initial crack 
tip region were taken by the high resolution CCD camera. The value of the 
crack tip separation δ was measured as the relative normal displacement 
between the two adherends at the location of the initial crack tip through the 
recorded digital images. Fig. (4.5) gives a typical relationship between the 
loadline displacement Δ (global displacement) and the local crack tip 
opening δ. By combining (Figs. 4.3 and 4.5), a typical experimental J-δ 
curve was obtained as shown in Fig. (4.6) (a specimen in group 2 with 
thickness of 0.2 mm). Based on Eq. (2.42), the experimental J-δ curves 
were used to determine the equivalent interfacial traction-separation laws 
or σ=σ(δ) at different adhesive thicknesses.

Effects of the Thickness of the Adhesive Layer 
With the global test results of different groups, the average maximum peel 
loads Pcr of the five specimens in each group (with error bar) are plotted as 
a function of the adhesive thicknesses (0.09 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 
mm, 0.8 mm, and 1.0 mm) in Fig. (4.7). It can be observed that the 
average peak load was increased from 578.8 N (Group 1) to 791.12 N 
(Group 6) when the thickness of the adhesive layer increased (from 0.09 
mm to 1.0 mm). These critical loads correspond to the characteristic 
energy release rate J0. The average estimated fracture energy JC (by the 
approximate asymptotes) and the average characteristic J0 (at the 
maximum peel load) of the five specimens in each group (with error bar) 
were plotted as a function of the adhesive thickness in Fig. (4.8). One may 
see that the fracture energy JC at the thickness of 0.09 mm is increased by 
approximately 160% when the adhesive thickness becomes 1.0 mm. The 
significant increase of J0 and JC are responsible for the increased load 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  195 
capacity when the adhesive thickness becomes thicker. Meanwhile, with 
Fig. (4.8), one may see that when the adhesive thickness is thin, J0 and JC 
are relatively close to each other. On the other hand, when it is relatively 
thick, J0 and JC are relatively departed from each other. Thus, we denote 
the difference between J0 and JC by ΔJ=JC─J0. Let’s consider a parameter 
ξ, which represents the ratio of the average ΔJ over the pertinent average 
J0 of the five specimens in each group. This ratio ξ is then plotted as a 
function of the adhesive thickness in Fig. (4.9). Obviously, the ratio ξ 
represents the relative increase in J to its initial value of J0 as J value 
becomes a nearly stable value (JC). Thus, Fig. (4.9) actually reflects the 
effects of adhesive thickness on the contributions by geometry a/h to the 
increase of plastic dissipations as crack grows.

Fig. (4.10). Typical shape of the equivalent interfacial traction-separation laws with different 
thicknesses of adhesive layer. 
After data collecting and curve-fitting process of the experimental J-δ 
curves, by applying Eq. (2.42), one can see that the interfacial 
traction-separation laws were determined by numerically differentiating the 
experimental J-δ curves. The cohesive law was calculated for each 
specimen. The typical equivalent cohesive law of each group is given in 
Fig. (4.10) at different adhesive thicknesses. From Fig. (4.10), one can see 
that three major effects of the adhesive thickness. First, the local 
characteristic separation (δ0) corresponding to the interfacial strength σmax, 
decreases with the decrease in the adhesive thickness. Second, the 
interfacial strength increases with the decrease of the adhesive thickness. 
Finally, the total area under the δ-σ curve, which represents the strain 
energy release rate at crack propagation, increases with the increase in the 
adhesive thickness. The complete thirty interfacial traction-separation 
laws (six groups with various adhesive thicknesses) are given in Fig. 
(4.11). One may see the five specimens in each group (each adhesive 
thickness) present fairly consistent results.

The average interfacial strength σmax of the six groups (with error bar) are 
plotted as a function of the adhesive thickness in Fig. (4.12). According to 
the manufacturer, the tensile strength of the bulk adhesive material is 
approximately 30.3 MPa (its yield strength is slightly lower than its tensile 
strength). One can see that the interfacial strength was 88 MPa at the 
thickness of 0.09 mm, which is approximately 3 times as large as the yield 
strength of the bulk adhesive material. The authors expects that with further 
decrease in the adhesive thickness, the measured equivalent interfacial 
strengths should keep increasing. This tendency is correct because the 
lower bound is when the adhesive thickness is reduced to the atomistic level, 
where the traction-separation response of a discrete atom pairs shows a very 
high strength but very low separation. On the contrary, with the increase in 
adhesive thickness, the measured interfacial strengths asymptotically 
approach a constant value. This asymptote seems being the yield strength of 
bulk adhesive material. Another phenomenon is that the equivalent 
interfacial strength seems increasing dramatically when the adhesive 
thickness was thinner than a certain value (such as 0.2 mm).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS OF MODE II TEST 
Global and Local Experimental Results 
Based on the analytical results of Ouyang and Li [35], with the current 
geometric configuration and the experimental data Table 3.2, it was found 
that all adherends (low carbon steel) remained linear elastic during the 
entire test process without any plastic deformation. This indicates that all 
the energy dissipation during the crack initiation and propagation were 
contributed by the intrinsic cohesive fracture and the possible plastic 
dissipation in the adhesive layer. A typical force vs. displacement curve at 
the loading point is shown in Fig. (5.1) (a specimen in group 1 with 
thickness of 0.1 mm). The force linearly increases until the local damage 
occurs. However, the load increases in a nonlinear pattern until the crack 
initiation process is completed. After that, the crack tip starts propagating. 
The crack continuously propagates with a continuous drop in the force until 
the crack propagates to the end of the ENF specimen. With Eq. (2.44), the 
experimental value of the strain energy release rate JII can be obtained by 
combining experimental values of δ0 and QT.

Group 1 (ha=0.1 mm). 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  201 
The value of the shear slip δ between the two adherends at the location of 
the initial crack tip is calculated based on the digital images, and they are 
plotted as a function of the loadline displacement Δ (global displacement) 
in Fig. (5.2) (a specimen in group 1 with thickness of 0.1 mm). By 
combining Figs. (5.1 and 5.2), a typical experimental J-δ curve is obtained 
as shown in Fig. (5.3) (a specimen in group 1 with thickness of 0.1 mm). 
With Eq. (2.45), the experimental J-δ curves are used to determine the 
equivalent interfacial traction-separation laws or τ=τ(δ) at different 
adhesive thicknesses. A characteristic strain energy release rate J0 is 
defined as the J value when the crack starts propagating immediately after 
the maximum fracture load Pcr is reached. It can be seen that J0 is generally 
smaller than the critical strain energy release rate or the fracture energy JIIC, 
which reflects that the strain energy release rate JII keeps increasing after 
the crack propagation. This is because the plastic dissipation (or plastic 
zone) can be further increased after the crack initiation.

In this study, the crack initiation and propagation processes were recorded 
by using the high resolution CCD camera. It was observed that the initial 
crack tip started opening as the shear load increased. It was also observed 
that the whiting zone appeared near the initial crack tip and was becoming 
more visible as the load was increased, as shown in Fig. (5.4) (red circle 
area). 
 
It was believed that the whiting zone consisted of numerous microcracks. 
When a lot of micro cracks were merged together and formed a macro crack, 
the initial crack started to propagate with the continuously increasing load, 
as shown in Fig. (5.5). Based on Eq. (2.45), these experimental J-δ curves 
are used to determine the equivalent interface cohesive laws or τ=τ(δ) at 
different adhesive thicknesses. Fig. (5.6) gives a typical shear stress vs. 
local slip displacement curve (a specimen in group 1 with thickness of 0.1 
mm).

Effects of the Thickness of the Adhesive Layer 
 
With the global experiment results for different groups, the maximum 
peel loads are plotted as a function of the adhesive thicknesses (0.1 mm, 
0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm, and 0.8 mm) as shown in Fig. (5.7). It can be 
observed that the average peak load is increased from 4912.24 N (Group 
1) to 5836.33 N (Group 5) when the thickness of adhesive layer increases 
(from 0.1 mm to 0.8 mm). However, the rate of increase in the peak load 
reduces as the adhesive layer thickness increases.

Fig. (5.7). The average maximum shear load Pcr at different adhesive thicknesses (ha=0.1 mm). 
The increase in the adhesive layer thickness might increase the bending 
stiffness of the ENF specimen. However, this contribution is very small 
since the adherends were made of low carbon steel with a much higher 
thickness of 9.535 mm and much higher bending stiffness. The estimated 
average fracture energy JC and the average characteristic J0 (at the 
maximum peel load) were plotted as a function of the adhesive thickness 
in Fig. (5.8) (0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm and 0.8 mm). The 
significant increase in J0 and JC are responsible for the increased load 
capacity when the adhesive thickness becomes thicker. Meanwhile, one 
may see that when the adhesive thickness is thin, J0 and JC are relatively 
close to each other. When it is relatively thick, J0 and JC are relatively 
departed. After data collecting and curve-fitting process of the 
experimental J-δ curves, by applying Eq. (2.45), one can see that the 
interfacial traction-slip laws are determined by numerically differentiating 
the experimental J-δ curves.

A typical equivalent interfacial law of each group is given in Fig. (5.9) at 
different bondline thicknesses. One may see that the effects of the 
bondline thickness on the interfacial traction-slip laws. First, the 
interfacial strength increases for steel ENF joint with the increase in the 
bondline thickness. Second, the initial stiffness of the interfacial laws (the 
initial slope of the τ-δ curve) is identical for steel ENF joints with various 
bondline thicknesses, which suggests that the shear deformation is 
controlled by the adhesive layer. Finally, the fracture energy (the total area 
under the δ-σ curve) increases with the bondline thickness. As shown in 
Fig. (5.9), the fracture energy JC of the bonded joints is plotted as a 
function of the adhesive thickness. The fracture energy JC at the thickness 
of 0.1 mm is increased by approximately 238% when the adhesive 
thickness is 0.8 mm. This significant increase in fracture energy can 
explain the increase in load capacity when the adhesive thickness is 
increased.

The average interfacial strength τmax of the five groups (with error bar) are 
plotted as a function of the adhesive thickness in Fig. (5.10). According to 
the manufacturer, the shear strength of the adhesive material is 
approximately 13.8 MPa (when the thickness is 0.75 mm with steel 
adherends). One can see that the interfacial strength was 14.9 MPa at the 
thickness of 0.8 mm, which is approximately the yield shear strength of the 
bulk adhesive material. Finally, the complete fifteen interfacial 
traction-separation laws of the bonded steel ENF joints (three specimens in

each group at various bondline thicknesses.

TEST 
 
Global and Local Test Results 
The geometric parameters of each specimen have been given in Table 3.3. A 
typical force vs. displacement curve (a specimen with ha=0.1mm and an 
initial crack length a=80mm) at the loading point is shown in Fig. (6.1). 
  
The force linearly increased until the local damage occurs. The load 
nonlinearly increases until the crack initiation process is completed. After 
that, the crack tip starts propagating. A continuous drop in the bending force 
was seen as the crack continuously propagated until the crack reached the 
specimen’s end.

The data of the rotation angel at the loading point were collected by the 
inclinometer. With Eq. (2.50), the experimental energy release rate J is 
determined by combining the measured θP and P. A typical relationship (a 
specimen with ha=0.1mm and initial crack length of 20mm) between global 
energy release rate J and loadline displacement Δ is given in Fig. (6.2). In a 
real test, we found that it was fairly difficult to exactly define when the 
initial crack tip was propagated. Therefore, a characteristic strain energy 
release rate J0 was defined which represented the J value when the 
maximum peel force P was reached. Note that with the growth of the crack, 
the global strain energy release rate keeps increasing as shown in Fig. (6.2) 
(J-Δ curve). This implies that the plastic dissipations beyond the crack tip 
must keep increasing during this stable growth process. However, the 
increase in J becomes slower and slower as the crack grows, which seems 
nearly stable even by the end of the test. Therefore, an approximate 
asymptote is added in Fig. (6.2) to estimate the interfacial toughness of the 
bonded joints. And this estimated asymptotic value is denoted by JC or 
fracture energy.

In this study, crack tip local deformations along the entire adhesive layer 
were recorded using the high resolution CCD camera. The value of the 
crack tip separation δ was measured as the relative normal displacement 
between the two steel adherends at the location of initial crack tip through 
the recorded digital images. By combining JI-δ curve and crack tip 
separation δ, a typical experimental JI-δ curve was obtained as shown in Fig. 
(6.3) (a specimen with ha=0.1mm and initial crack length of 80mm). With 
Eq. (2.51), the experimental JI-δ curves were used to determine the 
equivalent interfacial traction-separation laws or σ=σ(δ), as show in Fig. 
(6.4).

It was observed that the initial crack tip started opening as the shear load 
increased. It was also observed that the whiting zone appeared near the 
initial crack tip and was becoming more visible as the load was increased, 
as shown in Fig. (6.5) (circle area).

The value of the shear slip δ between the two adherends at the location of 
the initial crack tip is calculated based on the digital images. By combining 
P-Δ curve and local shear slip δ, according to Eq. (2.46), a typical 
experimental JII-δ curve is obtained as shown in Fig. (6.6) (a specimen wiht 
ha=0.1mm and initial crack length 80mm). With Eq. (2.49), the 
experimental JII-δ curves are used to determine the equivalent interfacial 
traction-separation laws or τ=τ(δ) at different adhesive thicknesses. A 

214  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                              Ji et al. 
characteristic strain energy release rate J0 is defined as the J value when the 
crack starts propagating immediately after the maximum fracture load Pcr is 
reached. It can be seen that J0 is generally smaller than the critical strain 
energy release rate or the fracture energy JIIC, which reflects that the strain 
energy release rate JII keeps increasing after the crack propagation. This is 
because the plastic dissipation (or plastic zone) can be further increased 
after the crack initiation. 
 
Based on Eq. (2.47), these experimental JII-δ curves are used to determine 
the equivalent interface cohesive laws or τ=τ(δ) at different adhesive 
thicknesses. Fig. (6.7) gives a typical shear stress vs. local slip displacement 
curve (a specimen with ha=0.1mm and initial crack length of 80mm).

Effects of the Thickness of the Adhesive Layer 
With the global experiment results for different groups, the maximum 
bending loads are plotted as a function of the adhesive thicknesses (0.1 
mm, 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm, and 0.8 mm) as shown in Fig. (6.8). It can 
be observed that the average peak load is increased from 3417.67 N to 
4791.10 N when the thickness of adhesive layer increases (from 0.1 mm 
to 0.8 mm), as shown by the trend line in Fig. (6.8).

The increase in the adhesive layer thickness might increase the bending 
stiffness of the specimen. However, this contribution is very small since the 
adherends were made of low carbon steel with a much higher thickness of 
6.35 mm and much higher bending stiffness. The estimated average fracture 
energy JIC, JIIC and the average characteristic energy JI0, JII0 (at the 
maximum peel load) were plotted as a function of the adhesive thickness in 
Figs. (6.9 and 6.10) (0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm and 0.8 mm). The 
significant increase in J0 and JC are responsible for the increased load 
capacity when the adhesive thickness becomes thicker. Meanwhile, one 
may see that when the adhesive thickness is thin, J0 and JC are relatively

close to each other. When it is relatively thick, J0 and JC are relatively 
departed. After data collecting and curve-fitting process of the experimental 
J-δ curves, by applying Eq. (2.51), one can see that the interfacial 
traction-slip laws are determined by numerically differentiating the 
experimental J-δ curves.

A typical equivalent interfacial law of each group is given in Figs. (6.11 
and 6.12) at different bondline thicknesses with initial crack length 
a=20mm. One may see that the effects of the bondline thickness on the 
interfacial traction-slip laws. 
 
Mode I Portion 
 
After data collecting and curve-fitting process of the experimental J-δ 
curves, by applying Eq. (2.46), one can see that the interfacial 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  217 
traction-separation laws were determined by numerically differentiating the 
experimental J-δ curves. The cohesive law was calculated for each 
specimen. The typical equivalent cohesive law of each group is given in 
Fig. (6.11) at different adhesive thicknesses. From Fig. (6.11), one can see 
that three major effects of the adhesive thickness. First, the local 
characteristic separation (δ 0) corresponding to the interfacial strength σmax, 
decreases with the decrease in the adhesive thickness. Second, the 
interfacial strength increases with the decrease in the adhesive thickness. 
Finally, the total area under the δ-σ curve, which represents the strain 
energy release rate at crack propagation, increases with the increase in the 
adhesive thickness. Again, the upper bound is the bulk material, which 
has the lowest traction but highest separation, and the lower bound is the 
atomistic level, which has the highest traction but lowest separation.

bondline thicknesses ha (a=20mm). 
Mode II Portion 
 
First, the interfacial strength increases for steel joint with the increase in 
the bondline thickness. Second, the initial stiffness of the interfacial laws 
(the initial slope of the τ-δ curve) is identical for steel joints with various 
bondline thicknesses, which suggests that the shear deformation is 
controlled by the adhesive layer. Finally, the fracture energy (the total area 
under the δ-τ curve) increases with the bondline thickness. As shown in 
Fig. (6.10), the fracture energy JIIC of the bonded joints is plotted as a 
function of the adhesive thickness. The fracture energy JIIC at the 
thickness of 0.1 mm is increased by approximately 143% when the 
adhesive thickness becomes 0.8 mm. This significant increase in fracture 
energy can explain the increase in load capacity when the adhesive 
thickness is increased.

Mode Mixities 
 
The ratio of the estimated fracture energy JIIC and total fracture energy 
(JIC +JIIC) with different adhesive thickness was plotted in Fig. (6.13). 
The ratio of the shear strength and total strength with different adhesive 
thickness was plotted in Fig. (6.14). It is observed that the ratio of the 
estimated fracture energy JIIC and the ratio of the shear strength were 
increased as the thickness of the adhesive layer increased. This indicates 
that the ratio of mode I within the mixed mode I/II was decreased as the 
thickness of the adhesive layer increased. The stiffness of the adhesive 
layer is much lower than the stiffness of the adherends. Therefore, as the 
thickness of adhesive layer increased, the plastic dissipation increased.

Effects of the Initial Crack Tip Length of the Adhesive Layer 
In this study, the effects of the initial crack tip length of the adhesive layer 
were also considered with different thickness of the adhesive layer. Three 
different initial crack lengths a=20mm, 50mm, and 80mm were selected in 
this study. 
The maximum bending load Pcr at each initial crack length with different 
thickness of the adhesive layer was plotted in Fig. (6.15). It is observed that 
the maximum load was decreased as the initial crack length increased; the 
maximum load was increased as the thickness of the adhesive layer 
increased at each initial crack length. As the initial crack length increased at 
the same thickness of the adhesive layer, the bending moment was 
increased at the initial crack tip. It caused the peeling force increase near the 
crack tip area at the same time. In other words, the mode I portion was 
increased as the initial crack length increased.

adhesive thicknesses ha. 

222  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                              Ji et al. 
When the thickness of the adhesive layer was 0.1mm, as the initial crack 
length increased, the mount of the adhesive material between the 
adherends decreased and the moment around the initial crack tip area 
increased. Additionally, the relative rotation angle between the two 
adherends increased and as a result, the smallest peeling force can make 
the crack propagate, as shown in Fig. (6.15). According to Eq. (2.50): 
JI=P*θ/4, although the loading force increased from 2047N to 3417N as 
the initial crack length decreased from 80mm to 20mm, the relative 
rotation angle decreased from 3.23rad to 1.97rad. As the thickness of the 
adhesive layer increased, the ratio of the increased relative rotation angle 
increased. It can be explained that why the increased ratio of JIC with 
initial crack length a=80mm is larger than the other two, as the thickness 
of adhesive layer increased. 
 
The estimated fracture energy JIC and JIIC at each initial crack length with 
different adhesive thickness were plotted in Fig. (6.16 and 6.17). It is 
observed that the JIC and JIIC were increased at each initial crack length as 
the thickness of the adhesive layer increases.  
In Fig. (6.16), the JIC was increased when the initial crack length was 
increased from 20mm to 50mm. Further increasing the initial crack length 
from 50mm to 80mm leads to reduction in JIC when the adhesive 
thickness is 0.1mm. With the increase in the adhesive layer thickness, the 
tread line of JIC with the initial crack length of 80mm line crossed the 
other trending lines with initial crack length at 20mm and 50mm. The 
phenomenon may be due to the combination effect of the thickness of the 
adhesive layer and initial crack length. This is a very interesting point that 
deserves in-depth investigation.  
 
In Fig. (6.17), the JIIC was decreased as the initial crack length increased 
with the same thickness of adhesive layer. It is understandable due to the 
decreased loading force with increased initial crack length. Additionally, 
as the thickness of the adhesive layer increased, the relative rotation angle 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  223 
between the two adherends increased and caused the increase in shear 
force.

Typical shapes of the interfacial traction-separation laws and traction-slip 
laws of the bonded steel with different bondline thickness were plotted in 
Figs. (6.18 and 6.19) (a=50mm), Figs. (6.20 and 6.21) (a=80mm). The 
interfacial strength σmax, τmax at each initial crack length with different 
thickness of the adhesive layer were plotted in Figs. (6.22 and 6.23). For 
each initial crack length, first, the local characteristic separation (δ0) 
corresponding to the interfacial strength σmax decreased with the decrease in 
the adhesive thickness. Second, the interfacial strength increases with the 
decrease in the adhesive thickness. Finally, the total area under the δ-σ 
curve, which represents the strain energy release rate at crack propagation, 
increases with the increase in the adhesive thickness. 
 
Additionally, the interfacial strength τmax increases for steel joint with the 
increase in the bondline thickness. The initial stiffness of the interfacial 
laws (the initial slope of the τ-δ curve) is identical for steel joints with 
various bondline thicknesses, which suggests that the shear deformation is 
controlled by the adhesive layer. The fracture energy (the total area under 
the δ-τ curve) increases with the bondline thickness.

Fig. (6.23). The effect of the adhesive thickness on the interfacial strength τmax with different initial 
crack length. 
According to Figs. (6.22 and 6.23), as the initial crack tip length increased, 
the interfacial shear strength was decreased with the increased thickness of 
the adhesive layer. Additionally, as the initial crack tip length increased 
from a=20mm to a=50mm, the interfacial peel strength decreased with 
increased thickness of the adhesive layer. However, when the initial crack 
length increased from 50mm to 80mm and the thickness increased from 
0.1mm to 0.6mm, the peel strength increased due to the increased moment 
and relative rotation angle which caused a compression zone near the crack 
tip area and prevented the crack propagation. Therefore, the peel strength 
increased. When the thickness increased from 0.6mm to 0.8mm, the 
bending stiffness of the adhesive layer increased and caused the decreased 
relative rotation angle. Therefore, the peel strength decreased without the 
compression zone around the crack tip area.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
Three fundamental fracture mechanics test (mode I, mode II, and mixed 
mode I/II) were conducted by the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB), End 
Notched Flexure (ENF), and Single Leg Bending (SLB) specimens with 
different adhesive thicknesses. According to the global test results of load 
and displacement and local test results of separation and slipping of initial 
crack tip under the quasi-static load, the fracture toughness and cohesive 
laws of traction-separation and traction-slipping (σ-δ and τ-δ) were 
developed with different thicknesses of adhesive layers.  
 
Mode I Test 
DCB specimens with different adhesive thicknesses experienced peel test 
(mode I test). Within the boundaries of the used materials parameters and 
based on the obtained data results, the following conclusions are yielded: 
 
a. The adhesive thickness has an influence on the critical loading 
force. As the thickness of the adhesive layer increases, the critical 
force is increased.  
b. As the adhesive thickness increases, the fracture toughness JIC and 
characteristic energy JI0 (corresponding to critical load) are 
increased.  
c. The local crack tip separation δ is also increased, as the thickness 
of the adhesive layer increases. 
d. The thickness of the adhesive layer also has a significant effect on 
the interfacial strength (σ). For the adherends made of higher 
bending stiffness material (greater than the adhesive’s flexure 
stiffness such as steel in this study), as the adhesive thickness 
decreases, the fracture strength (σ) is increased due to the 
increased constraining force of the adherends which can prevent 
the crack propagation around the initial crack tip area.

e. With the J-integral theory, the present study first presents the 
experimental evidence that the cohesive strength is 88 MPa which 
is about 3 times of the yield strength of the bulk adhesive when 
the adhesive thickness is 90 μm (steel based specimen). 
f. It is also noted that the significant plastic dissipation will not 
necessarily be reflected in the globally measured value of the 
fracture energy when the adhesive thickness is relatively thin  
and even the intrinsic cohesive strength is much higher than the 
bulk adhesive’s yield strength.  
Mode II Test 
In this study, the steel based adherends of adhesively bonded joints are 
subjected to mode II loading using End Notched Flexure (ENF) 
specimens. The objective is to measure the fracture toughness of the joint 
corresponding to different thicknesses of the adhesive layer and to deduce 
the nature of the cohesive (traction-separation) law that governs the crack 
growth behavior. Within the boundaries of the used materials parameters 
and based on the test results, the following conclusions are obtained: 
a. The adhesive thickness has an influence on the critical loading 
force. As the thickness of the adhesive layer increases, the critical 
force is increased.  
b. As the adhesive thickness increases, the fracture toughness JIIC 
and characteristic energy JII0 (corresponding to critical load) are 
increased.  
c. The local crack tip slipping δ is also increased, as the thickness of 
the adhesive layer increases. 
d. The thickness of the adhesive layer also has a considerable effect 
on the fracture strength (τ). As the adhesive thickness increases, 
the fracture strength (τ) is increased.

Mixed Mode I/II Test 
In this study, the steel based adherends of adhesively bonded joints are 
subjected to mixed mode I/II loading using Single Leg Bending (SLB) 
specimens. The objective is to measure the fracture toughness (JIC & JIIC) 
of the joint corresponding to different thicknesses of the adhesive layer 
and different initial crack lengths and to deduce the nature of the cohesive 
(traction-separation & traction-slipping) law that governs the crack 
growth behavior. Within the boundaries of the used materials parameter 
and based on the test results, the following conclusions are derived: 
 
a. The adhesive thickness has an influence on the critical loading 
force. As the thickness of adhesive layer increases, the critical 
force is increased.  
b. As the adhesive thickness increases, the fracture toughness JIC, JIIC 
and characteristic energy JI0, JII0 (corresponding to critical load) 
are increased.  
c. The local crack tip separation and slipping δ are also increased, as 
the thickness of the adhesive layer increases. 
d. The thickness of the adhesive layer also has a significant effect on 
the interfacial strength (σ). As the adhesive thickness decreases, 
the fracture strength (σ) is increased due to the increased 
constraining force of the adherends which can prevent the crack 
propagation around the initial crack tip area.  
e. The thickness of adhesive layer also has a considerable influence 
on the fracture strength (τ). As the adhesive thickness increases, 
the fracture strength (τ) is increased.  
f. As initial crack length increases, the critical loading force is 
decreased with the same adhesive thickness.  
g. The fracture toughness JIIC and fracture strength τ are increased as 
the initial crack length decreased with the same thickness of 

Effect of Bondline Thickness                            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  231 
adhesive layer. It means the mode II portion is decreased as initial 
crack length increased. 
 
However, the fracture toughness JIC and fracture strength (σ) are not 
always increased or decreased as the initial crack length increases. It is 
very complicated due to the combination effect of the initial crack length 
and adhesive thickness.

Abstract: With the continual development of the aircraft industry, aircraft engines 
have provoked people’s attention more and more. The turbine blade plays a vital and 
critical component of aircraft engines. In order to conform to the dimensional 
tolerances of wax pattern die-profile for turbine blade in investment casting process, 
this chapter provides an optimization method of geometric parameter for turbine 
blades based on inverse adjustment. The geometric parameters for optimizing were 
extracted, and the bending and torsional deformation can be compensation. 
Therefore the nonlinear deformation compensation during solidification and cooling 
procedure can be efficiently realized. This method set the theoretical foundation on 
optimization method of die-cavity for turbine blade. The die-profile optimization 
system which was developed in this paper proves better effect for the die-cavity 
design. This chapter also offers a reverse design methodology for investment die 
casting using ProCAST. In industry, the performance of the engine depends not only 
on shape, but also on the dimensions of the components. This process is difficult as 
super-alloy blade material cannot be easily machined. However investment casting 
is an ideal process for such net - shape components, but it still requires an accurate 
determination of the casting-die profile. In order to investigate and analyze the 
methods that affect the shape and dimensions of the turbine blade most, similar

simulations have been conducted by ProCAST. By combining the methods of 
simplifying grid files and quick sorting, the efficiency of sorting and matching can 
be largely improved. Furthermore, the mold die cavity anti-deformation system can 
be easily built by utilizing that reverse design methodology. The optimized die 
profile for investment casting can be established with ProCAST.

INTRODUCTION 
Investment casting, or traditionally called lost wax casting process, is to 
make precise metal product without further machining by pouring the 
liquid metal into a pre-shaped mold. This process simplifies production 
by casting a single complex-shaped piece instead of manufacturing a 
product that requires assembling several pieces together [1]. It is well 
known that investment casting is used routinely for fabricating 
single-crystal nickel super-alloy turbine blades. The turbine blades are 
usually of complex geometries with intricate channels, which allow air to 
flow within and along the blades during operation [2-3]. 
A conventional investment casting procedure includes: A. preparing wax 
patterns by injecting wax into previously designed dies; B. making 
ceramic shells covering the wax patterns; and C. the alloys are cast into 
the de-waxed shell molds. It is obvious that the shape of the casting 
significantly depends on the cavity geometry of the metal die. Due to the 
shrinkage of the wax and solidification of the alloy material, the size of 
the component produced by the investment casting process is smaller than 
that of the die cavity. Although the volume changes in the solidification 
process are simple in nature, the complex geometry of the turbine blade 
makes closed-form solutions for the shrinkage almost intractable. 
Therefore, in order to ensure the dimensional tolerance, the geometrical 
accuracy and the surface roughness, the design of the die profile for 
turbine blade needs to consider the compensation of the shrinkages and 
thermal distortion during solidification [4]. 
Due to the complex, time-consuming and expensive process of 
investment casting, traditional methods for designing die profile assumes 
constant shrinkage rate [5]. However, the complex shape and structure 
causes uneven heat dissipation during cooling, and thus the non-linear and 
non-uniform shrinkage distribution. Further considerations have to be 
given to the shrinkage of wax pattern during preparation; ceramic shell

shrinkage during drying and expansion during casting; super-alloy 
material (if applicable) shrinkage during solidification, as well as cooling 
from the solidus to room temperature. The dimensional changes 
associated with the wax, the shell mold, or the alloy are thereafter referred 
to as wax, shell mold, or alloy shrinkage factors (SFs) (or tooling 
allowances), respectively. It is a typical practice to calculate the 
dimensions of the die tools by adjusting the nominal casting dimensions 
by SFs. Moreover, the casting deforms due to the mold constrain stress 
and the thermal stress. Taking the cast steel and cast iron materials for 
example, the geometrical shrinkage can be in the range of several 
millimeters. Therefore, solid shrinking causes the most accuracy loss 
during casting. 
The principle of designing the die profile is to compensate geometrical 
deformation. At present, the establishment of die profile is based on the 
linear scaling methodology including uniform scaling method; chord 
length scaling method; mean camber line scaling method; and shrinkage 
center scaling method [6]. All these methods assume a constant shrinkage 
rate for designing the die tool profile. Consequent discrepancy from the 
reality is generated due to the negligence of non-uniform distribution 
shrinkage. Ito et al. [7] and Ferreira et al. [8] presented a method by 
utilizing different shrinkage rates for various directions. However, such 
calculation did not consider the influences of casting structure and various 
constraint conditions. It also required experiences and efforts for 
establishing an appropriate numerical model.  
With the help of commercially developed solidification simulation 
software based on finite element analysis, reliable simulation results can 
be obtained once the thermal properties data and boundary conditions are 
available [9-16]. Therefore, the calculated local deformation, due to the 
thermal field and geometrical constraints, can provide the evidence for 
designing the die profile. Modukuru et al. [17] proposed a grid 

244  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                            Dou et al. 
displacement reverse stacking method, in which the calculated 
deformations were reversed and stacked into each node, this process was 
iterated until the deformed shape had good agreement with the ideal one. 
With 3-D graphical output, this method can be regarded as a virtual 
process of modifying die profile until the accurate numerical simulation 
result is achieved. Recently, Zhang Dan et al. [18] developed a simple 
reversing methodology of adjusting parameters for the casting die profile 
design of turbine blades, in which the casting shrinkages were considered 
as nonlinear at different positions. The die profile obtained by employing 
this method can satisfy the design requirement. However, a 2-D 
configuration of this method limited its extensive applications; the 
accuracy and reliability of die profile require further improvement. 
OPTIMIZATION OF GEOMETRIC PARAMETERS FOR TUR- 
BINE BLADE 
Geometric Parameter Extraction of Cross-section 
There are more than 20 kinds of parameters which are related to the 
structure, strength, and the manufacturing process of turbine blade [19], 
however, this paper mainly studies the method in determining die-profile 
of turbine blade. Because the blade-design method can be based on 
specifying a thickness distribution around the mean camber line, thus, 
those parameters which can be used to represent and re-construct the 
mean camber line are discussed. 
The deformation of turbine blades can be divided into three aspects: 
torsional deformation, bending deformation and shrinkage deformation 
[20]. Hence, the geometric parameters can be divided into three categories: 
the torsional control parameters, the bending control parameters, and the 
shrinkage control parameters. In this paper, assuming that the shrinkage 
ratio shows the constant change, which means, the shrinkage ratio is using

the experienced value. Thereafter, only two categories of parameters are 
discussed in this paper. 
Extraction of Bending Control Parameters 
The bending control parameters can be expressed by mean camber line. In 
essence, the mean camber line is a two-dimensional free-form curve. If 
the length of mean camber line remains constant, the freedom of mean 
camber line can be restricted by four parameters: α1, α2, L, and Pmax. The 
blade exit angle α2 is the angle between the tangents to the camber line at 
the trailing, it represents the slope of blade exit part. If the numbers of 
discrete points on mean camber line are sufficient, the angle between the 
line connecting the last two points of mean camber line and the front of 
blade can be regarded as the blade inlet angle (Fig. 1). 
 
Fig. (1). Sketch of geometric parameters. 
 
The way of extraction blade exit angle (α1) is similar to the blade inlet 
extraction method. Considering the angle between the line connecting the 
first two points and the front of blade as the blade inlet angle, the blade 
inlet angle can be established. 

246  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                            Dou et al. 
If chord is considered as the horizontal axis in coordinate system, the 
maximum deflection position (Pmax) can be regarded as the point which 
has the maximum distance from the mean camber line to the chord. Thus, 
a line parallel to the chord can be drawn which being tangent to the mean 
camber line, and the tangency point can be identified as the maximum 
deflection position

Extraction of Torsional Control Parameters 
Using the direction which is perpendicular to the front of blade direction 
as X axis direction, the leading edge point is the point which has the 
minimum abscissa amount, while the trailing edge point is the point 
which has the maximal abscissa amount, and the chord can be define as 
the line connecting the leading edge point and the trailing edge point. 
Then, the stagger angle can be defined as the angle between chord and the 
front of blade. 
Optimization of Torsional Control Parameters 
The stagger angle β is the parameter which can be used to represent the 
torsional deformation of blade, hence, the compensation of the torsional 
deformation is to compensate the deformation of β. As indicated in Fig. (2), 
the solid line represents the schematic diagram of the blade section and the 
dashed line represents the section after torsional deformation. β1 represents 
the stagger angle of CAD model, and β2 represents the stagger angle of the 
measuring model. The torsional deformation can be expressed as ∆β = β2 - 
β1, the equation which can be used for torsion deformation compensation 
can be rearranged as:

Where βm the optimized is stagger angle, ∆D is equal to ∆β, βc is stagger 
angle of CAD model. 
Optimization of Bending Control Parameters 
The bending deformation can be denoted by the blade inlet angle α1 , the 
blade exit angle α2, the maximum deflection position Pm, and the chord 

248  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                            Dou et al. 
length L (Fig. 3). The optimization of the bending control parameters is to 
compensation each parameter properly. However, these parameters are not 
independent and are of interaction and restricted mutually. Therefore, it is 
necessary to determine the relationship of geometric parameters firstly. As 
is shown in Fig. (3), the coordinate value of A dot (XA, YA) and the last 
point of mean camber line B (m, M) need to be determined, the 
geometrical meaning of A dot is the intersection point of the tangent lines 
of the first and last point of mean camber line. Hence, the establishment of 
the coordinate value of dot A can be calculated based on two-point form 
of straight-line equation. 
Then respectively calculating the coordinate values of A dot in CAD 
model and measuring mode of the certain turbine blade, based on the 
compensation of discrete points, the optimized coordinate value of A dot 
can be determined by optimized coordinate value of A dot can be 
determined by

distance between dot $A$ in CAD model and measuring model, 
respectively. 
The coordinate value of dot B, which is the last point of mean camber line 
can be solved in the same way by the distance compensation method. (Eq. 
(2). 
By solving a quadratic equation with cot α1 as a variant, the dependent 
variables are the coordinate value of the last point of mean camber line (m,

is the shape coefficient, for the form error is related to the structure of

Hence, a shape coefficient noted is introduced.

Using Eq. (4) to compensate the bending deformation, the shape 
coefficient must be firstly determined. Assuming the length of mean 
camber line keeps unchanged after investment casting, based on calculus 
relation, the whole mean camber line can be divided into infinite units 
equally, shown in Fig (4). Assuming that the length of curve-unit is 
sufficiently small, thus, the curve-unit can be interpreted as the straight 
line, which can be formed with a right-angled triangle by chord length and 
height of segment H.

Fig. (4) shows that the change of chord length is influenced by the height 
of segment variation, the shape coefficient can be expressed as ∆Hi+1 / 
∆Hi. Where H

represents the difference between the height of segments 
of measuring model and CAD model. ∆Hi represents the difference of 
intervallic deformation between two iterative calculation steps.  

Optimization of Geometric Parameters                  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  251 
Therefore, the optimized chord length can be determined, meanwhile, the 
optimized blade inlet angle, optimized blade exit angle and the optimized 
maximum deflection position can be obtained, and the bending 
deformation can be compensated. 
Results and Discussion 
The extraction of a type of certain turbine blade is shown in Fig. (5). After 
the extraction of parameters, the corresponding data of CAD model and 
measuring data are calculated. For the cross- section at height of 50mm, 
the results are shown in Fig. (6), and the optimize cross-section is shown 
in Fig. (7). The lines shown in Fig. (7) are the mean camber line, the 
thicker line represents the optimized mean camber line, while the thinner 
line represents the original one.

Based on the method proposed above, using several (4-6) sections to 
reconstruct the die profile. Although the optimized die-profile for the 
investment-casting of turbine blade is established, however, the 
die-profile's availability obtained by the method proposed still needs to be 
further investigated by numerical simulation. Using ProCAST [21], the 
displacement of three directions can be obtained.

From Fig. (8), the maximum displacement along Z direction is 0.908mm, 
the dimension is still can’t satisfy the accuracy requirements. Therefore, 
based on the numerical simulation results, using the inverse method to 
optimize the die cavity again, calculating the displacement field by 
ProCAST based on the same material properties and boundary conditions, 
the simulation results are shown in Fig (9). From Fig (9), the maximum 
displacement along Z direction is 0.545mm. The deviation is decreased, 
which proves the methods proposed in this paper can improve the casting 
accuracy efficiently.

In order to conform to the dimensional tolerances of wax pattern 
die-profile for turbine blade in investment casting process, an optimized 
method for the determination of geometric parameter of die cavity is 
proposed in this chapter. The geometric parameters describing die-cavity 
are extracted and optimized, the deformation of the turbine blade occurred 
in solidification process can be compensated. This method therefore 
exhibits its advantage over the traditional linear scaling method. An 
optimization system is developed to realize the optimization process, 
which proves better effect on the die cavity design.

OPTIMUM DESIGN METHOD OF DIE PROFILE 
The traditional way for designing die profile is to reserve certain 
deformations opposite the deformation directions obtained by numerical 
simulation or experience. In order to prevent deformations, the shape of 
casting would be equal to that of the CAD model after solidification. Fig. 
(10) illustrates the basic principle of reverse deformation method, in 
which line P represents initial shape, line Q is the shape after deformation, 
and line R is the shape after reverse deformation operation.  
 
Fig. (10). Sketch for the basic principles of reverse deformation. 
Due to the complicated shape of turbine blade, the accuracy requirement 
cannot be satisfied by one step compensation. Consequently, this paper 
adopts cyclic iteration to approach the target shape. Assume D(x, y, z), 
P(x, y, z), Q(x, y, z) and W(x, y, z) are the objective function, the shape 
function of turbine blade before investment casting, the shape function of 
blade after casting process, and the displacement field function 
(deformation function) of the each node (x,y,z) in the FEM model, the 
initial shape of Pi(xi, yi, zi) will evolve into the deformed shape Qi(xi, yi, zi) 
after i times inverse iterations. The casting result is then compared with 
the target shape and the difference of ∆Di(xi, yi, zi) is calculated as:

If difference ∆Di is less than ∆Max (the threshold for maximum error), 
Pi(xi, yi, zi) can be taken as the ideal deformed shape. Otherwise, the 
deformed shape must be adjusted by -∆Di (as shown in Eq. 6) and 
program iterates until the maximum error threshold is met. Fig. (11) 
shows the program flow chart of such iteration. The final reverse 
deformation function can be established as Eq. 7.

Fig. (12). Flow chart of the simulation process based on ProCAST. 
The primary workflow of ProCAST can be divided into three stages - 
“Pre-Processing”; “Problem Solving” or “processing”; and “Date Output”. 
In the first stage, the 3-D entity model and gating system are established 
by CAD software, such as UG. ParaSolid is employed to deliver the 
model information and to convert file format if necessary. After the CAD 
model is imported into ProCAST, MeshCAST module - a fully automatic 
3-D tetrahedral mesh generator - is called to generate surface mesh, the 
shell and the volume mesh. PreCAST module deals with the model 
geometry and defines conditions (such as assigning materials, defining 
interface, setting boundary conditions, appointing process, and selecting 
suitable running parameters). It is noted that each chosen surface can only 
be assigned by one boundary condition, therefore the definition of surface 

Optimization of Geometric Parameters                  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  257 
boundary condition is critical. DataCAST module manages data, 
including converting the text files generated by PreCAST module to 
binary format. FEM calculation takes place in ProCAST module and the 
results (such as temperature field, stress field and displacement field 
during simulation) can be rigorously visualized by ViewCAST module. 
The intermediate files produced in each step during simulation using 
ProCAST are also included in Fig. (3). For example, *.sm is the surface 
mesh file recording the number of surface mesh nodes and the 
corresponding coordinates; * _shell.sm is the casting and shell surface 
mesh files; * _shell.mesh is volume mesh file collecting volume mesh 
information; *_shelld.dat file records all information in *_shell.mesh files 
and interface between shell and casting; *_shelld.out files contain 
boundary conditions and thermo-physical properties; and *_shellgd.dat 
files record all volume mesh information upon termination. 
FEM PROCESSING 
The FEM process using ProCAST can be divided into two aspects: A. 
collect necessary node information by reading corresponding mesh files 
(refer to Fig. 13); and B. generate plenty grid nodes for accuracy during 
the simulation process. 
During FEM process, sorting nodes has to be optimized for not only 
reducing the CPU time but also shortening the node matching process. 
Rearrangement of nodes first occurs after ProCAST automatically assigns 
a contact node at the interface of casting and shell (those nodes are 
generated in MeshCAST module) and put this new node at the end of the 
file. 
DataCAST module transforms *_shelld.dat from text into binary format 
to improve execution efficiency. Node rearrangement also occurs in this 
module, in which nodes are sorted with updated coordinate information. 

258  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                            Dou et al. 
The sorted node information is then exported into *_shelld.out file, which 
also contains an index table recording the corresponding relationship 
among grid nodes.

Node matching is completed by processing two rearrangements 
simultaneously. Shown in Fig. (14), two index tables are created after the 
rearrangement and then the corresponding relationship of the nodes can 
be obtained by referring to the index table. 
Then the mesh files should be simplified and the necessary node 
coordinates information is extracted. In current work, the demarcation 
searching method is used to search the corresponding nodes. Demarcation 
searching method is commonly used to compare the data sizes by 
boundary values [18]. First, the data are sorted by initial boundary values 
and the boundary value will be adjusted in accordance with demarcation

Demarcation searching method sorts by employing a divide and conquer 
strategy to divide a list into two sub-lists. The steps are: firstly pick an 
element, called a pivot, from the list. Then reorder the list so that all

elements which are less than the pivot come before the pivot and so that 
all elements greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go 
either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is 
called the partition operation. Finally recursively sort the sub-list of lesser 
elements and the sub-list of greater elements. The base cases of the 
recursion are lists of size zero or one, which are always sorted. 
EXAMPLE VERIFICAITON 
DD6 alloy is chosen as the turbine blade material, and the mold material 
is silica sand (thermo-physical properties of DD6 alloy and the mould 
material can be found in Ref [22-23]). Fig. (16) shows a typical blade 
mould design with a gating system. To simplify the geometry of the 
turbine blade modeling and to improve the computational efficiency, only 
one third blade module group is chosen (shown in Fig. 17). Further, we 
adopt gravity filling method and ignore the influence of filling period. We 
assume the initial casting temperature is 1550℃, the temperature of the 
shell mould (pre-heat) is 1500℃, and the calculation is terminated at a 
temperature of 600℃. 
Simulation result (including intermediate results) can be extracted from 
the data file generated after each iteration step. Fig. (18) illustrates the 
deformation of the turbine blade during simulation process at the steps of 
80, 150, 300 and 640, respectively. Fig. (18a) represents the deformation 
of blade width (X direction); (b) represents the thickness deformation (Y 
direction), (c) represents the length deformation (Z direction). It has been 
found from the simulation data that severe blade surface deformation is in 
the width direction (Fig. 18a). Non-uniformly distributed stress field is 
caused by complex heat dissipation in the solidification process. It is 
anticipated that the blade back undertakes tensile stress and the 
thin-walled part of the blade pressure side undertakes compressive stress. 
The shrinkage of the blade turns toward the suction direction and the 
maximum deformation.

The displacement field of the turbine blade represents the summation of 
nodes displacement. It is determined by the structure of the blade and the 
boundary conditions (reflecting the blade and casting process). However, 
the casting dimensional change is also associated with wax pattern, wax 
property, wax temperature, wax flow and the manufacturing process, etc. 
In this paper, we assume the wax pattern is fixed with less distortion or 
even no distortion. The influence of wax pattern dimensional changes is 
negligible.

system interfaces is shown as Fig. (19).

This system module reads files generated from each simulation step, 
orders and matches the grid nodes while updating the displacement field. 
The output of the system is the new surface mesh file. Fig. (20) shows a 
new surface mesh of die profile of a turbine blade.

Then the investment casting process should be simulated again so as to 
obtain a new turbine blades model. Based on ProCAST, shape error is 
used to evaluate the results of displacement field compensation. The 
shape form error can be defined as follows:

where D the CAD leaf is coordinates of ith node, Q is the simulated 
surface coordinate of ith node, N is the total number of surface nodes. 
The shape form error M reflects the coincidence degree of two surface 
meshes. The smaller the form error is the more optimized mesh surface 
from the original CAD one. Let X,Y,Z denote the average form error of 
three directions, respectively, one can see from Table 1 that after 4th 
iterations, the synthetic form error decreases from 0.516mm to 0.002mm. 
Such convergence effect can meet the error requirement of the die cavity 
design for turbine blades.

CONCLUSION 
Based on ProCAST, the mesh files generated during numerical simulation 
are used as input for the mesh information processing system. The quick 
sorting and matching of nodes are realized, the disorder nodes can be 
transformed into ordered ones. By analyzing the characteristics of mesh 
files, a reversing design methodology is proposed; the form error can 
meet the design requirement after iteration. The investment casting blades’ 
mould optimization system was developed and verified with an example. 
This research has potential applications in optimizing die profile design, 
reducing cost and increasing productivity.

Abstract: This chapter discusses the structural analysis aspects of aerospace 
structures focusing on vibration induced fatigue. Metal Fatigue of dynamically 
loaded structures is a very common phenomenon in engineering practice. Several 
aerospace structures are used in environments where they experience dynamic 
loading. Furthermore, when the loading is dynamic, the response of the structure is 
affected by the structural resonances. Thus, the structural response to the loading will 
amplify at the regions of resonance. As a case study, an antenna (12-59 V/UHF) 
integration process on helicopter is investigated where the importance of the dynamic 
response is highlighted. Flight tests and finite element analyses (FEA) are carried out 
to ensure the safety of the integration process. Furthermore, another important aspect 
of the structural analysis of aerospace structures is the testing strategy. In this study, 
the fatigue tests performed by uni-axial tests which is a procedure defined in military 
standards are compared to multi axial testing. The results are shown for a helicopter 
Chaff/Flare Dispenser Bracket. The military standards assume that cumulatively uni- 
axial testing has equal multi axial testing fatigue damage. In this study, the uni-axial

fatigue tests were compared to multi axial fatigue tests which were performed by 
FEA simulations. Furthermore, the effects of various loading conditions and 
geometries were investigated. The study showed that the assumption of multi axial 
testing can be represented by uni-axial testing does not hold for various cases.

INTRODUCTION 
Mechanical structures usually work in a dynamic loading environment 
and most of the time the loading is repeating itself in time. This repetitive 
loading doesn’t have to be above the yield stress of the structure for 
failure. Repetitively loading the structure will ultimately cause failure. 
 
This phenomenon is called as Fatigue Failure. Typically, fatigue failure 
starts at the highest stress zones by forming cracks and then propagates 
under cyclic loading, where the stress state can be still under the yield 
point of the material. When a limit is reached for the number of cycles of 
loading the component fails at a fatigue failure surface. Unfortunately, 
most of the time fatigue failures cannot be detected until catastrophic 
accidents occur. In the past, many accidents due to the fatigue failures in 
metals have occurred. Fig. (1) shows some of them. 
Furthermore, according to the survey [3] for helicopter component fatigue 
failures, these failures are approximately 55% of all premature failures in 
helicopter components as shown in Table 1. 
This chapter will consist of two case studies which will focus on different 
analysis and testing aspects of aerospace structures. The first section will 
investigate an antenna integration process including flight tests and stress 
analysis where the structure will not require fatigue analysis [4]. The 
antenna is part of the MXF-484 V/UHF transmitter, which is used to 
safely communicate without any enemy interference. Fig. (2) shows the 
integration area on the helicopter.

The second section will be focusing on vibration induced fatigue analysis 
and testing of a helicopter’s Chaff/Flare Dispenser Bracket which is an 
extended version of the study given by Aykan et al. [5]. The Flare (Fig. 3) 
is used to misguide missiles where small, very hot particles are disposed 
from the helicopter whereas Chaff hides the radar signature of the 
helicopter where electromagnetic particles are disposed.

FLIGHT TESTS AND NUMERICAL ANALYSES OF AN 
ANTENNA FOR SAFETY OF FLIGHT 
Operational Flight Tests before Integration 
In order to assess the safety of the integration process, vibration analysis 
and testing of the antenna integration region must be performed. First of 
all, the loading to the antenna has to be measured. The measured values of 
pre-integration state will also be used to compare the test results that are 
measured after integration. Flight tests are performed according to a flight 
profile which was defined by test pilots. It includes steady flight sections 
as well as rough maneuvers that the helicopter will encounter through its 
life. The vibration levels of the antenna integration location are measured 
by using 7 ICP type tri-axial accelerometers (Fig. 2b) where the sampling 
rate was chosen to be 5000 S/s. 
 
Numerical Structural Analyses 
The structural analyses consist of modal analysis and vibration analysis. 
In order to have accurate results, a wider portion compared to the antenna 
integration region of the helicopter is modeled. The cowling model 
including the antenna region is given in Fig. (4). 50859 Shell elements 
with 90537 nodes are used for modeling the cowling in ANSYS [6]. 

274  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                       Aykan and Çelik 
 
The edge numbered by "1" as shown in Fig. (4a) is a locked edge and the 
edge numbered with "4" is far away from the location analyzed. Therefore, 
the degrees of freedoms of these edges are fixed. Quarter turn fasteners 
are used close to the edges "2" and "3" and these edges are not fixed but 
simply supported. The materials used in the analysis consist of aluminum 
2024-T3 and steel 4140. 
Modal analysis of the cowling model is performed for with/without 
antenna configurations. The mode shape for the first natural frequency of 
the cowling changed from bending to rotation and the first natural 
frequency of the antenna integration region has decreased from 154.3 Hz 
to 67.9 Hz as shown in Fig. (5).

Similarly, the stress distributions of the cowling with and without the 
antenna are also needed to assess the safety of integration. A smaller 
region of the cowling Fig. (6) is included in the vibration analysis as the 
modal analysis results showed that the first 3 modes of the antenna region 
are local modes. The analysis model has 19959 elements and 60935 
nodes.  
The random time history signals are usually defined in frequency domain 
as Power Spectral Density (PSD) functions [7]. PSD presents this 
information as a statistical spectrum where the area under the curve 
represents the mean square amplitude of the wave other than the 
amplitude. Since PSD values are needed for the vibration analysis, the 
tri-axial vibration measurements are transformed to PSD and applied as 
loading boundaries at the measurement locations in the FEA.  
 
Fig. (6). Simplified model created for PSD analyses. 
Maximum equivalent von Mises stresses are obtained at the cowling 
mounting holes when the antenna is not present as shown in Fig. (7a) and 
at antenna mounting holes when the antenna is present (Fig. 7b). Since 
PSD stresses are statistically 1σ results, maximum stress values should be 
tripled to achieve 3σ results. That is, three times larger stresses may occur 
on the given location statistically (Fig. 8).

Table 2 summarizes the results of the numerical modal and vibration 
analyses. It is clear that a significant increase in maximum stress and 
decrease in first natural frequency results from integration of the antenna. 
However, as even the 3σ stress values are small compared to the fatigue 
strength of the aluminum alloy used, the antenna integration is not fatigue 
critical.

Operational Flight Tests after Integration 
Numerical results showed that there is little risk for the installation of the 
antenna. In order to validate the integration, flight tests with the antenna 
are performed according to the same flight profile. A total of seven 
tri-axial accelerometers are placed on the cowling portion on which the 
antenna is mounted. Accelerometer locations for this configuration are 
shown in Fig. (9). 
The acceleration data collected during flight tests are compared with the 
previous test where the antenna was not installed. According to the PSD 
comparison, antenna integration has increased the overall vibration levels 
at some of the measurement locations. A sample comparison is given for 
location 5 in Fig. (10).

PSD graphs are also compared with the levels given in the military 
standard MIL-STD-810F [8]. Fig. (11) shows the comparison of 
measured lateral vibrations at location-5 with a sine-on-random graph 
which is specified in MIL-STD-810F. Fig. (11) shows that the peaks 
occur at the same frequencies as in the standards’ profile. In addition, 
floor levels do not exceed the random portion of the standards’ profile. 
This is valid for all the locations where vibration data is collected. This 
comparison gives confidence that the integration process does not 
significantly change the overall vibration characteristics of the helicopter 
even at the locations where the vibration levels have increased.

VIBRATION INDUCED FATIGUE ANALYSIS AND TESTING OF 
A CHAFF/FLARE DISPENSER BRACKET 
The design of a bracket for a chaff/flare dispenser has many requirements 
to fulfill. Static, modal, transient and fatigue analyses must be performed 

280  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                       Aykan and Çelik 
 
to complete the design with required safety factors. In this study, fatigue 
analysis and testing of an aerospace structure exposed to broadband 
loading is highlighted. Traditionally, fatigue analyses have been 
performed in the time domain where the response is calculated by static 
analysis. However, studies [9-12] show that when the loading excites the 
natural frequencies of the structure, time domain approach lacked the 
dynamics of the structure. Therefore, the analyses in this study are 
performed in the frequency domain using random vibration theory. Fig. 
(12) shows the basic flow for both time and frequency domain methods. 
Moreover, it is common to perform fatigue tests under uniaxial loading 
conditions. Even when multi-axial analyses are performed, the S-N 
diagrams used are obtained from uni-axial tests. There are numerous 
studies in the literature which point out that multi-axial fatigue analyses 
are necessary when higher accuracy is required [13-16]. However, the 
importance of multi-axial testing in fatigue analysis has yet received 
much attention. Recent studies showed that multi-axial testing affects the 
failure duration, mode and the distributions even on very simple 
specimens [17].

Vibration Fatigue Analysis Method 
Vibration fatigue method, which is a frequency domain method, is 
applicable when the encountered loading is random in nature and the 
statistical information of the process has to be evaluated. The random 
processes can be categorized as broad band and narrow band processes. 
Furthermore, it may consist of a broad band spectra with periodic waves 
on top of it (i.e. sine- on-random), which is the case in helicopters. The 
random time histories are usually expressed as PSD functions. Sample 
time histories and corresponding PSD functions are given in Fig. (13). 
 
Fig. (13). Time histories and corresponding PSD graphs [7]. 
Given a measurement for a duration T of the random time series y(t), its 
PSD, Gyy(f,T) can be defined [18] as Eq. 1 where all phase information is 
lost in the process.

Thus, using Eq. 5, the stress response PSD values can be calculated for a 
specific location of the structure where the loading induced is partially 
correlated.  
Furthermore, in Vibration Fatigue analysis, the Probability Density

Function (PDF) of Rainflow ranges [19] has to be extracted for damage 
calculations. By using such a method, the PDFs will be used in the stress 
ranges counting, instead of the classical Rain flow counting method 
which is used in time domain. The PDF is derived from the response 
stress’ PSD. The elements of the loads' counting process are given in Fig. 
(14).

(∆S-d(∆S) : ∆S+ d(∆S)). 
The key element of vibration fatigue analysis is the PDF and PDF can be 
obtained from the PSD of stresses [20]. The characteristics of PSD that 
are used to obtain this information are the spectral moments of the PSD 
function. The nth spectral moment of the PSD is defined as shown in Fig. 
(15) and expressed as in Eq. 7.

The spectral moments can be used to calculate the expected value of 
peaks per second, E[P], which is used in the calculation of fatigue life. In 
order to derive the fatigue damage equation for a random process, let 
p(∆S) to be defined as the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the 
random process. For a resonant system subjected to a broadband 
excitation, in time T there will be on average E[P]·T stress cycles of

From this equation one can find the life of a component by setting the 
E[D] equal to unity and obtain the life, T in seconds. For the integrations 
given above a cut-off value for the upper limit is necessary. This value is 
typically given in terms of Root Mean Square (RMS) values of stress. It is 
common to set the cut-off value to 3 RMS in amplitude or 6 RMS in 
range, but practice has shown that it should be at least set to 4.5 RMS in 
amplitude in order not to miss fatigue damage. 
There are many empirical solutions for the probability density function of 
Rainflow stress ranges, p(∆S), like Tunna, Wirsching, Hancock, 
Chaudhury and Dover [7] but the best correlation was obtained by Dirlik 
[21] after computer simulations to model random signals using the Monte 
Carlo method.

The damage equation (Eq. (8)) with the probability density function (Eq. 
(9)) is used primarily in Aerospace, Military and in some industrial areas. 
The ability to include broad band frequency loading environments to 
fatigue damage calculations makes this method more powerful than time 
domain methods when the dynamic characteristics of the structure cannot 
be ignored. 
Fatigue Analysis and Tests 
In this study, due to the combined broad band and narrow band frequency 
loading encountered which is typical for a helicopter; vibration fatigue 
method is chosen as the analysis method. This section will include the 
analysis of three different designs in order to investigate different 
parameters effecting fatigue life and damage location.  
The analysis method requires transfer functions of the structure and the 
vibration loading. It is possible to measure or calculate the transfer 
functions from prototypes or from numerical analysis of virtual 
prototypes. In this study, they are obtained from a FEA software 
(ANSYS). Verification of the numerical model was made by modal 
testing and analysis. The modal tests and analysis showed that the first 3 
modes of the structure had a maximum error of 2% between the 
numerical and test model. The details of the modal testing and analysis

performed will not be discussed in this study. Furthermore, for the 
vibration fatigue analysis calculations, MSC Fatigue [22] software is 
used.  
The installation location of the bracket was chosen to have the maximum 
dispersion of Chaff/Flare particles (Fig. 16). In order to find the load time 
histories for this location, military standards (MIL-STD-810E/F, 
GAM-EG-13 etc.) were investigated for the AH-1W helicopter but 
unfortunately very coarse information was obtained. Therefore, the 
loading time histories were obtained from flight tests performed on the 
helicopter using two tri-axial accelerometers where the system will be 
installed.

The vibration fatigue analysis requires the PSDs’ of the loading. 
Therefore, a loading PSD matrix with cross correlation components and 
corresponding transfer function numbers are calculated and given in Table 
3 and Figs. (17-19).

During the fatigue analysis, the mean stress is not corrected due to the fact 
that mean stresses cannot be directly defined in vibration fatigue analysis 
method. In this method, the response always oscillates around zero stress 
level. However, it is always possible to calculate the mean stress level for 
the structure and then shift the S-N curve by applying any mean stress 
correction theories (Goodman, Soderberg). Furthermore, a better and 
faster solution is to calculate the life under oscillating stresses only and 
then the life of the critical points can be recalculated with the added mean

stress, as used in this study.  
Analysis of Design-1 
The fatigue life results of the first designed Chaff/Flare dispenser bracket 
are shown in Fig. (20). This design is produced from aluminum blocks 
and assembled using bolts. In order to validate the calculations, fatigue 
tests had to be performed by testing the bracket three axes simultaneously. 
However, the testing hardware was not suitable for the multi axial testing. 
Thus, tests were performed on each axis separately as shown in Fig. (21). 
The laboratory vibration tests were performed in 4 hours where the 
operational loading was accelerated from 12000 flight hours for the 
fatigue tests. The fatigue tests ended with no visual damage.

location under multi axis loading (Fatigue Life 8.59e-3 sec).

Fig. (21). Fatigue testing of the Chaff/Flare dispenser bracket (z-axis). 
However, this is not the same as applying all of the vibration profiles at 
the same time as it is occurring in real life. Fatigue analyses were 
recalculated for each axis separately which is encountered in accelerated 
tests for test and analysis comparison. From the analysis results, it was 
observed that x-axis (longitudinal axis of the helicopter) loading has 
nearly no effect on the fatigue damage accumulation. Y-axis (transverse 
axis of the helicopter) has the biggest effect and z-axis (vertical axis of the 
helicopter) has a lower effect compared to the y-axis. 
As for each axis a different critical location can exist, 445 locations (with 
gradual damage distribution) are obtained from the first fatigue analysis, 
in which all the three axes loading is applied at the same time, and then 
the damage analyses are performed for these locations. In this analysis, 
damage values from each axis are summed for these locations which gave 

292  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                       Aykan and Çelik 
 
the cumulative damage for axis by axis loading. The analysis results were 
compared with the simulation results of multi axial loading. Furthermore, 
the percent deviation values of uni-axial loading from multi axis loading 
are calculated and a moving average algorithm is applied on the data. The 
mean percent deviation of damage was obtained as ranging from 35% to 
72%. 
 
From this analysis it is evident that test time has to be extended in order to 
fully obtain the multi axis loading effect when performing an axis by axis 
test procedure. However, the increase in test time cannot be the same for 
all locations due to having different percent deviations of damage. In 
order to be safe, the testing duration for sequential testing can be 
increased by 72%.   
Analysis of Design-2 
In order to investigate the effect of different geometries on the deviation 
in damage, a model without four stiffener corner components of the 
Chaff/Flare dispenser is analyzed.  
The new model where the stiffeners are removed is re-analyzed for 6061 
HV T6 material at operational and MIL-STD-810F loading environment. 
However, it must be noted that this profile is accelerated for 2600 flight 
hours whereas the operational loading is used in the previous analyses. 
The results of this analysis showed that the life distribution changed and 
most damaged locations are at the bottom of the dispenser as shown in 
Fig. (22). The mean percent deviations for these new locations are given 
in Fig. (23). 
In this case study, it is found out that when operational loading is applied 
most of the damage is due to the z axis loading. However, for MIL STD 
810F loading case, all of the axes have more or less equal amount of 
contribution to damage. This phenomenon is dominant for locations 
between "10" and "35" which causes a decrease in the mean percent 
deviation of MIL STD 810F loading. The faster accumulation of damage 

Vibration Induced Fatigue Analysis                       Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  293 
 
in those locations for MIL STD 810F loading decreases the mean percent 
deviation. However, for MIL STD 810F loading case different critical 
locations are also formed. This clearly shows that the conservativeness of 
military standards can change the critical location for some cases.

Analysis of Design-3 
In the case study given above, it was shown that slight geometric change 
affected the damage distributions considerably. In this case study, a 
completely different design is analyzed for fatigue. In order to reduce the 
weight of the dispenser bracket, the bracket was produced from sheet 
metal where the connecting elements are mostly rivets as shown in Fig. 
(24).

metal model [23]. 
The last analysis emphasizes the geometry dependence of the mean percent 
deviation of damage for sequential loading from multi axis loading.  
In order to compare the fatigue analysis results with tests for the sheet 
metal model, fatigue tests were performed on each axis separately as 
shown in Fig. (27). The operational loading is again accelerated to 4 hours 
of laboratory test time which corresponds to 12000 flight hours for the 
fatigue tests. 
The failure criterion for these tests is defined as the formation of a visible 
crack. The x and y axes concluded with no visual damage. However, at 
the third hour in z axis, the dispenser loosened. As the x and y axis were 
already completed, the corresponding flight hour where the dispenser 
loosened cannot be accurately determined. A coarse approximation can be 
that these deformations occurred at the 9000th flight hour for three axes 
loading.

The fatigue analyses resulted in similar locations having high damage 
values but the observed deformations at these locations cannot be referred 
as fatigue failures. The damage type that can be analyzed with vibration 
fatigue method is only fatigue damage. Other types of damage such as 
plastic deformations cannot be identified with this approach. However, 
due to the plastic deformations observed, there is high probability that 
fatigue failures will occur at these locations which is consistent with 
sequential uni-axial fatigue analyses. 
CONCLUSION 
Structures used on helicopters are exposed to a broad frequency band of 
excitation which consist of random and periodic loading caused by 
aerodynamics and the rotors and transmissions of the helicopter, 
respectively. Structures containing dynamic behavior as resonance are 
indeed difficult to analyze for fatigue. The response of the structure is 
amplified when the loading has frequency components which drive the 
structure to resonance. Due to this phenomenon, the time domain fatigue 
methods where it is assumed that the structure response can be solely 

298  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                       Aykan and Çelik 
 
obtained from static analysis cannot be used. One more point to highlight 
is that, although the loading is multi-axial, vibration fatigue method was 
used as the dynamics of the structure dominate the response, instead of 
multi axial fatigue methods. If stress data for the multi-axial loading can 
be obtained, which for large and complex structures in FEM is impractical 
(requires transient dynamic analysis) then multi-axial fatigue theories can 
also be used. But this method, without using FEM, requires experimental 
methods. 
It should be noted that the accurate stress results obtained from the finite 
elements analysis play a critical role for fatigue life of the structure. 
Approximately 7% increase in stress value causes 50% reduction of life. 
Therefore, it may not be enough that the finite element model simulates 
the dynamic characteristics correctly. Stress concentrations occurring in 
the finite element is the main reason for inaccurate stress results, which 
can only be validated by tests. In the analyses performed, the damage 
distribution of the structure was obtained which is a more valuable 
information than the life. As a result, the most damaged areas can be 
modified to be stronger. Furthermore, it should be noted that the critical 
location found from a static analysis is different from the critical location 
obtained from the dynamic analysis. This is due to the fact that when the 
natural frequencies of the structure are excited, the response of the 
structure is controlled by the mode shapes.  
The fatigue tests performed also contain some assumptions. First of all, 
the tests are sequential and cross correlations are not included in the 
fatigue tests. Secondly, the moments are not applied. The parametric case 
studies showed that the fatigue damage accumulating for a structures 
varies with changes in loading, material and geometry and a formulated 
factor that can take these parameter changes into account is not available. 
This sensitive structure when combined with nonlinear response in the 
frequency domain yields multi axis testing to be an industrial and military 
standard. Also from (Fig. 23), it is evident that accelerating the vibration 
loading can cause a further deviation from multi axis testing. The most 
realistic case would be to use a six-DOF vibration testing machine where 

Vibration Induced Fatigue Analysis                       Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  299 
 
the loading is not accelerated.  
In the case where sequential testing is necessary, a fatigue analysis has to 
be performed for sequential and multi axis loading in order to calculate 
the safety factor to compensate the damage deviation.  
A better way of obtaining fatigue life is obtained by using strain gages at 
critical locations, which can be obtained by the fatigue analysis performed 
in this work, and then performing operational flight tests to get the stress 
history. Then this stress history can be used to get the fatigue life of the 
strain gage locations. Due to the fact that the stress values obtained during 
flights will be more accurate than the finite element stress results a more 
accurate life value can be achieved.  
Structures designed for the aerospace applications must ensure flight 
safety requirements. This is indeed a very difficult objective to achieve 
with the presence of wide band frequency loading along with structural 
nonlinearities. In such cases, experimental analysis is still the best method 
to secure the durability of these aerospace structures.

Abstract: Surface treatments, such as laser peening, can increase the life of the 
component by generating compressive residual stresses on the surface. Laser peening 
of an already peened component, termed as re-peening, can further increase the 
fatigue life of the component. Re-peening has several applications in the aerospace 
industry. The huge population of ageing aircraft components is one such application, 
which can benefit significantly from the re-peening process. However, this process 
is not optimized for maximum fatigue life due to the presence of many design 
variables and the complex nature of the problem which requires a large number of 
experimental testing to reach conclusions. Therefore, a computationally efficient 
optimization strategy needs to be developed to conduct large-scale laser peening 
simulations for problems related to fatigue life, such as aircraft lug failure, a problem 
that requires consideration of component curvature and residual stress relaxation 
effects. Deciding the time to peen an already peened component (re-peening time) is 
another variable which makes the problem further complicated. The ultimate goal of 
this research is to construct the framework to predict the optimum parameters for 
maximum fatigue life on structural components.  A two-step optimization strategy 
is adopted for the fatigue life optimization of an aircraft lug component. The strategy

INTRODUCTION 
The potential reason for fatigue failure on structural components is the 
generation of tensile stresses on component surface. These surface regions 
become the hot spot to initiate cracks. Generation of compressive residual 
stresses can inhibit or delay the crack initiation and growth. Surface 
enhancement techniques can generate compressive residual stresses and 
hence play an important role in improving the life of the peened 

304  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Vasu and Grandhi 
components [1]. Shot peening is the most commonly used mechanical 
surface treatment method. Other widely applied methods in the industry 
are low plasticity burnishing, water jet peening, laser peening, roller 
burnishing, ultrasonic peening, peen forming, cavity peening, etc. Laser 
peening generates deeper compressive stresses compared to other surface 
treatments like shot peening, making it appealing to the industry. Fig. (1) 
shows the fatigue effect of the material Al 7075-T7351 treated by laser 
peening with comparison to unpeened and shot peened materials (bending 
tests, stress ratio=0.1) [2]. This shows that laser peened material has an 
improved fatigue life. 
 
Fig. (1). Fatigue life comparison for Al 7075-T7351. 
A pictorial representation of a typical laser peening method is shown in 
Fig. (2). The target material is typically coated with an ablative overlay 
and confined by a transparent overlay. When the laser pulse impacts the 
material, the absorbent material vaporizes and creates plasma. This 

Fatigue Life Optimization                              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  305 
plasma confined by the transparent overlay creates a pressure pulse which 
is propagated into the material as a shock wave. When the stress created 
by shockwave exceeds dynamic yield strength of the material, plastic 
deformation of the surface microstructure occurs and compressive stresses 
are generated inside the material, significantly more near the surface. The 
ablative overlay protects the material surface from temperature effects and 
makes laser peening a purely mechanical process. The transparent overlay 
confines the plasma from rapid expansion away from the material surface 
which helps to obtain a high intensity pressure pulse into the material. 
Black paint or tape is usually considered as the opaque overlay while 
flowing water along the peening surface is generally taken as the 
transparent overlay.

Although the conventional laser peening process takes advantage of the 
sacrificial overlay, laser peening without coating (LPwC) has been 
employed for the underwater maintenance of nuclear power plants in 
Japan [3]. This process results in surface roughness and may have thermal 
effects due to direct ablation, but can increase in the fatigue life of the 
component. The method’s advantages in the application in remote 
environments such as nuclear facilities make it a preferable choice for 
certain operations. 
 
Fig. (3). Cracking at frame lug. 
Laser peening has extensive applications in the aerospace industry. One 
such example is the F-22 Raptor, which is a twin engine fifth-generation 
fighter aircraft that uses stealth technology. In the fatigue life testing 
carried out on this aircraft, cracks in the wing attachment lugs were 
identified, as shown in Fig. (3) [4]. Location 1 indicates the region at the 
lower lug profile that experienced the initial cracking approximately 1.2 

Fatigue Life Optimization                              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  307 
lifetimes of testing. This region was repaired during the test and after 2.5 
lifetimes of testing another crack emerged around the lug bore region 
(Location 2). Replacing the lugs with new ones requires removing the 
part from the entire assembly. This process is very cost prohibitive. Laser 
peening serves the purpose of imparting favorable residual stresses in the 
material surface thereby improving the fatigue life of such components. 
Other aerospace applications include usage on engine parts, turbine blades, 
fasteners, valves, transmission components, etc. 
Crack initiation often occurs along the curved regions or fillets of 
structural components because of the presence of high stress 
concentrations. Laser peening should be conducted in these critical 
regions to improve the life of the components. There are several 
parameters which will affect the peened regions. However, the physics of 
laser peening involves shock wave propagation and is very complicated. 
Simulation models are very useful in predicting the structural behavior 
and hence, save the costly experiments. This research concentrates on 
predicting the material behavior after laser peening using computational 
models. The residual stress induced in a curved geometry cannot be 
predicted based on the trends obtained from a flat model, since neglecting 
the curvature effect can lead to an incorrect assumption of residual 
stresses and thereby the fatigue life [5]. Therefore, it is pivotal to 
understand the behavior of laser peening application along component 
curvature. The complicated nature of residual stress behavior on curved 
geometry makes this task very difficult for researchers [6]. Laser peening 
of an already peened component can increase the fatigue life during the 
service life of the component. Peening the component at the correct time 
can also be key to increasing the fatigue life. However, the residual 
stresses generated by surface enhancement techniques can relax 
(reduction in compressive nature) during the fatigue life cycle. Therefore, 
the effect of stress relaxation needs to be considered for better fatigue life 
prediction and re-peening decision. In addition, the actual loading 
scenarios can also affect the fatigue life significantly. Surface treatments 
are generally not optimized for maximum fatigue life due to the presence 

308  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Vasu and Grandhi 
of many design variables and the complex nature of the problem which 
requires a large number of experimental testing to reach conclusions. 
Therefore, a computationally efficient optimization strategy needs to be 
developed to conduct large-scale laser peening simulations for problems 
related to fatigue life, such as aircraft lug failures, which is a problem that 
requires consideration of curvature and relaxation effects. 
In this research, a two-step optimization strategy is implemented to 
maximize the fatigue life of a laser peened component. In the first step, a 
DOE-based response surface model is created with the novel surrogate 
modeling technique, the Sorted k-fold Approach (SKA). This step will 
maximize the compressive residual stress (CRS) while satisfying the 
maximum allowable tensile residual stress (constraint). In the second step, 
the maximum CRS will be input into the re-peening formulation for 
obtaining the maximum fatigue life when the re-peening time is used as 
the design variable. 
INFLUENCING FACTORS FOR FATIGUE LIFE PREDICTION 
The prediction of fatigue life can be improved significantly by 
considering all the important parameters related to laser peening of 
structural components. Five factors have been deemed critical for accurate 
prediction of laser peened components; they are the peening-induced 
residual stresses, the applied load, the relaxation of residual stresses, the 
re-peening mechanism, and the fatigue failure. The framework for 
predicting the fatigue life is shown in Fig. (4). An indirect approach is 
adopted where the load and the residual stresses are analyzed separately. 
In a realistic scenario, it is a sequential process where residual stresses are 
generated by laser peening and then the load is applied. However, the 
computational cost of doing it is very high that the residual stress can be 
assumed to be a mean stress added to the applied load. The fatigue 
loading can cause the residual stress to relax; hence, the relaxation step 
should be considered in order to give a good prediction of the fatigue life. 
By adding re-peening to the existing framework, the increase in the 
fatigue life of the structure can be predicted. The significance of each 

Fatigue Life Optimization                              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  309 
factor has been explained previously by the authors [7]. A summary of 
predicting these factors are discussed in this section. 
 
Fig. (4). Computational framework for conducting fatigue life prediction. 
Applied Load 
The fatigue load on the components is usually approximated by simplistic 
constant amplitude loading to save the experimental cost. However, 
realistic load scenarios can have a significant impact on the fatigue life of 
the component. Using simulation models, fatigue load on the component 
can be applied similar to what the component experience during its life 
cycle. For aerospace components, a loading standard was introduced 
pertaining to a fighter aircraft wing bending mechanism primarily 
governed by maneuver loadings. FALSTAFF (Fighter Aircraft Loading 
Standard for Fatigue) represents uniquely defined sequence of normalized 

310  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Vasu and Grandhi 
numbers ranging from 1 to 32 representing the peaks and troughs in load 
history generated from 200 flight data as shown in Fig. (5a) [8]. The 
FALSTAFF has much more pronounced peaks due to aggressive 
maneuvers of fighter aircrafts. Although the FALSTAFF spectrum 
overestimates the fatigue life, many aircrafts (not just fighters) use it as a 
standard for a worst case scenario, thus promoting safety. Based on the 
stress induced on the critical component, a stress spectrum can be created 
from the load spectrum as shown in Fig. (5b). This stress spectrum can be 
utilized in the fatigue analysis.

Laser Peening Induced Residual Stresses 
The residual stresses generated by laser peening process can be predicted 
by finite element analysis (FEA) [9]. The geometry of the critical region 
is an important factor to consider while modeling laser peening process 
with FEA. Assuming the geometry to be a simplified flat model can 
significantly affect the residual stress prediction [10]. The comparison of 
compressive residual stress prediction of spherical models to cylindrical 
models for concave and convex geometry is shown in Fig (6). The 
difference in compressive residual stress is due to the difference in 

Fatigue Life Optimization                              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  311 
plasticity generated by the shock waves.

Residual Stress Relaxation 
Many empirical and analytical models, which can be used to evaluate the 
effect of relaxation during cyclic loading, have been formulated by 
researchers over the years. Some of the most prominent empirical models 
are given in this section. Morrow and Sinclair modeled residual stress 
relaxation based on mean stress relaxation in axial fatigue tests [11]. 
Kodama proposed a linear logarithmic relationship based on surface 
stresses on a shot peened material [12]. Their empirical models are given 
by Eqs. 1, and 2 respectively.

C1, and C2 are constants which are determined by curve fitting the

sophisticated physics-based models have also been developed [13]. Any 
of these models can be utilized in predicting the residual stress relaxation 
of laser peened components based on the requirements of the application.

Fatigue Life 
 
In this research, a stress-life approach is used to predict fatigue life of 
laser peened components. Other fatigue prediction methods, such as 
strain-life approach, can also be used as an alternative based on the 

Fatigue Life Optimization                              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  313 
availability of material parameters and the nature of the problem [14]. Fig. 
(7) shows the step-by-step procedure for life prediction of components 
undergoing the laser peening process. The load on the aircraft component, 
represented by the FALSTAFF spectrum, is used to create stress spectrum 
on the component by conducting a unit load FEA. The alternating stress 
(σa) and the mean stress (σm) due to the fatigue loading are obtained from 
the stress spectrum. The residual stress (σr) from the laser peening 
simulation is added to the mean stress. Using Modified Goodman 
Equation, fatigue strength (σNf) is calculated. In the next step, number of 
cycles to failure (Nf) is calculated for individual stress segments using 
Basquin’s equation. The Cumulative Damage caused by the complete 
stress spectrum is obtained by palmgen-miner linear damage rule. In the 
last step, the fatigue life is calculated by inverting the cumulative damage.

Re-Peening 
 
A flow of predicting re-peening stress state is shown in Fig (8). The 
predicted residual stress state is also shown. In the first step, laser peening 
is conducted on the base material. The generated residual stresses will 
undergo relaxation when the component is subjected to fatigue loading. 
Another round of laser peening on the relaxed component can bolster the 
fatigue life by increasing the magnitude of residual stresses around the 
surface regions. As seen from the figure, re-peening can also increase the 
compressive residual stress depth, which can further delay the 
propagation of crack along the peened regions.

OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE 
Application of laser peening on an aircraft lug component is used as an 
example to illustrate the fatigue life optimization process. The critical 

Fatigue Life Optimization                              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  315 
region predicted by unit load FEA (concave geometry with angle of 
curvature 400) matched the crack location in the lug as shown in Fig (9). 
Therefore, laser peening FEA was conducted for concave geometry to 
predict the residual stresses. Johnson-Cook material model is often used 
to predict the effects of laser peening process on components due to the 
high strain rate behavior [15]. The material used in this research is 4340 
Steel. The details of the FEA model, material properties, and the analysis 
results have been published by the authors recently [7]. 
 
Design Variables 
 
The design variables considered are re-peening time (R), peak pressure of 
the laser pulse (P), mid-span duration of the laser pulse (t), and percentage 
overlapping (O) of the laser spots. A brief description of the design 
variables and the choice of design bounds are explained in the following 
paragraphs: 
 
Re-Peening Schedule 
 
Re-peening is believed to increase the fatigue life by delaying the crack 
nucleation as well as the propagation of structural components. Since 
peening multiple times during a component’s life can be a costly process, 
we assume that re-peening is conducted once during the lifetime of the 
component. Therefore, the bounds for re-peening time can be any time 
(once) during the component’s life time and is represented in problem 
formulation. Cyclic loading leads to relaxation and redistribution of the 
residual stress field. These factors influence the fatigue life during 
re-peening. Two stress relaxation models are created to predict the 
residual stresses after re-peening. The first one is a conservative model 
which takes the maximum stress amplitude from the stress spectrum to 
predict the re-peened residual stress state. The second relaxation model 
uses all the information from the stress spectrum to predict the residual 
stresses using a weighted average method [7]. The effects of the two 
models for an initial residual stress of -493 MPa is shown in Fig (10). 

316  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Vasu and Grandhi 
 
Fig. (10). Re-peening effect caused by maximum and weighted relaxation models. 
Mid-Span Duration 
In the experiments, the laser beam mid-span duration normally varies 
between 10-30 ns. The pressure pulse mid-span duration is approximately 
2 to 2.5 times that of the laser beam mid-span duration. Therefore 20 ns 
and 60 ns are taken as upper and lower limits for the mid-span duration. 
The temporal pressure profile input to the simulation box can be 
approximated by seven representative points as shown in Fig. (11). Point 
5 is used to define the mid-span duration while keeping point 4 constant. 
The bounds for point 5 are calculated with a two-point formula and are 
found to be 30 ns and 90 ns.

Fig. (11). Temporal pressure profile taken for optimization. 
Peak Pressure 
Plastic deformation occurs only if the peak pressure pulse is at least 1 
HEL (Hugoniot Elastic Limit), which is a function of dynamic yield 
strength. A very high peak pressure can lead to spallation of the material 
resulting in reduction of fatigue life. Hence, the bounds for the peak 
pressure (3 GPa - 6 GPa) have been chosen accordingly. 
Percentage Overlap 
Percentage overlapping is another important parameter to be considered 
while modeling for maximum fatigue life [16]. Laser peening without 
proper overlapping instructions can lead to the formation of tensile 
stresses and can even cause premature failure of the laser peened 
component. Increasing the percentage of overlapping has been found to 
have a direct correlation with higher CRS and hence a bound of 40% to 
80% is considered. A 75% overlapping pattern is shown in Fig. (12).

Optimization Strategy 
The choice of cost function is based on the major output of the simulation, 
which is to obtain the maximum fatigue life. A two-step optimization 
strategy is followed in this chapter as shown in Fig (13).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Compressive Residual Stress Optimization Results 
The problem statement is given by: 
Maximize f(x), f(x) = Compressive Residual Stress 
subject to g(x) ≤ 100 MPa, g(x) = Allowable Tensile Residual Stress 
where the bounds of the variables are given by: 
3 GPa ≤  P  ≤ 6 GPa, P – Peak pressure 
30 ns  ≤  t ≤  90 ns, t – Mid-span duration 
40% ≤ O ≤ 80%, O – Percentage Overlap 
A DOE-based solution method (Sorted k-fold Approach) is developed to 
create the surrogate models for f(x) and g(x). Peak pressure (P), 
percentage overlapping (O), and mid-span duration (t) are used to 
construct the surrogates for compressive residual stress optimization [17]. 
All these variables are quantitative in nature and have been proven to 
make a significant difference in the compressive residual stress (σCRS) 
generated on the surface of the component as well as the tensile stress 
generated inside the material (σTRS). The data set to be utilized in the 
metamodels is obtained through latin hypercube sampling (lhs) to obtain 
30 data points. The tabulated laser peening simulation outputs with design 
input parameters based on the design bounds are shown in Table 1. 
A quadratic polynomial response surface model is considered for this 
analysis, which requires determining ten regression coefficients. The 
surrogates for the objective function and constraints are constructed with 
the ten-fold SKA, and are given by Eqs. 3 and 4 respectively.

The optimized results are given by: P = 3.97 GPa, O = 80%, t = 30 ns, 
σCRS = -542 MPa, and σTRS = 100 MPa. An extra simulation is run at the 
optimized design point which yields σCRS = -511 MPa, σTRS = 103 MPa, 
which is very similar to the predicted result. Therefore, this result is used 
for the second phase of the optimization problem. 
Optimization of the Re-Peening Schedule 
The maximum CRS (σCRS = -511 MPa) obtained for the aircraft lug 
problem can be directly used as the mean stress for fatigue analysis. Since 
analytical equations are used in fatigue life calculation with the stress-life 
approach, exhaustive optimization scheme is employed. Fig. (14) shows 
the fatigue life versus re-peening schedules for the maximum and 
weighted relaxation models. The results from the life predictor models 
with the relaxation models show that the best time to re-peen the 
component is ~ 55% of the component’s expected life.

The optimum parameters to laser peen a structural component in order to 
maximize the component’s fatigue life have to be determined. The fatigue

loading can cause the residual stress to relax; hence, the relaxation step 
should be considered to give a good prediction of the fatigue life. By 
conducting re-peening, we will be able to increase the fatigue life of the 
component. A computational framework is created incorporating the key 
constituents impacting the life such as load spectrum, residual stress 
relaxation, and re-peening for the laser peening process to predict an 
optimal re-peening schedule to improve the fatigue life. A two-phase 
optimization strategy is employed to obtain prolonged fatigue life of an 
aircraft lug. In the first phase, a three-variable RSM is constructed with 
the SKA for both objective function and the constraint to conduct CRS 
optimization. The predicted CRS matches the simulation results closely. 
In the second phase, the optimum CRS is input into re-peening 
optimization routine, which predicts the best time to re-peen the 
component for maximum fatigue life. It is observed that re-peening the 
component around 55% of its initial fatigue life yields the maximum 
fatigue life for the structural component.

Abstract: Laser peening is an advanced surface enhanced method which induces 
compressive residual stress on the critical regions of components prone to fatigue 
failure. However, the residual stresses relax under the fatigue loading conditions. 
Constitutive models have to be robust enough to predict the residual stress 
relaxation mechanism. Although tensile cold working increases the tensile yield 
strength, the compressive yield strength is reduced. As a result of this, a lower 
compressive load can relax the initial compressive residual stress. This 
phenomenon, termed as Bauschinger Effect, can be represented by an analytical 
stress-strain model to predict the relaxation effects based on the cold working of 
the material. Three dimensional finite element (FE) models are created to represent 
residual stress relaxation in a low cycle fatigue regime for Ti-6Al-4V material. The 
creation of the numerical model for simulating stress relaxation model involves 
two phases. The first phase is modeling the stress gradient effect which relates to 
the effect of cold working. This process utilizes a laser peening simulation model. 
The second phase is modeling the stress-strain response of the material by creating 
a mixed hardening model.

INTRODUCTION 
How to prevent failure in materials has been a great research interest all 
over the world for centuries. It has been found out that cyclic loading is a 
major cause of failure in many situations. There can be other contributing 
factors, such as manufacturing defects and the presence of unfavorable 
residual stresses. But residual stresses can also play a positive role and 
can enhance the life of the component, if applied properly. There exist 
methods named Surface enhancement techniques (SET), which can 
induce favorable residual stresses (mechanical SET) on surface regions of 
peened components to improve the fatigue life of the component [1]. Fig. 
(1) depicts a pictorial representation of the impact of SET on fatigue life.

Fig. (2) shows the mechanism behind the mechanical surface 
enhancement methods. When the material is peened under loading, the 
surface region in contact would be plastically deformed. The surrounding

bulk material, which is elastically deformed, tries to come back to its 
initial state generating compressive stresses in the surface region while 
tensile stresses are created in the subsurface to attain static equilibrium in 
the material. These methods are effective on solving problems such as 
tensile stress buildup, the main reason of failure in many components. 
Surface enhancement techniques play an important role in improving the 
life of the peened components by creating compressive stress field on the 
surface, and thus, delaying or eliminating the crack initiation and 
propagation inside the material [2].

Laser peening has emerged to be a popular surface treatment method 
because it can significantly improve the fatigue performance of structural 
components by inducing compressive residual stresses [3]. However, the 
process parameters should be carefully chosen to obtain optimal

performance; application without proper strategy can result in unwanted 
tensile stresses and even reduction in the fatigue life [4]. The residual 
stresses induced by different peening methods may also relax due to 
cyclic loading [5]. The material still shows an overall beneficial effect on 
the fatigue life of the specimen in spite of the relaxation, but neglecting 
the relaxation effect would lead to over-prediction of the fatigue life [6]. 
James proposed that the relaxation behavior due to cyclic loading can be 
separated into three regimes based on the yield strength and the endurance 
limit [7]. When the stress exceeds the yield strength of the material, a 
complete redistribution of the residual stress takes place and can cause 
rapid relaxation of initial compressive residual stress. When the stress is 
below the endurance limit, a relatively weak relaxation can take place in 
the material. In the case of intermediate stress amplitudes, relaxation has 
been found to be a function of cyclic stress amplitudes. 
 
Morrow and Sinclair created an empirical model to predict the relaxation 
effect based on axial fatigue test experiments [8]. Many other researchers 
followed up the initial work to generate more experimental models to 
quantify cyclic stress relaxation. Jhansale and Topper suggested an 
exponential relationship between mean stress relaxation and the number 
of cycles [9]. Kodama proposed a linear logarithmic relationship based on 
the surface stresses on a shot peened material, and claimed that the 
relaxation rate was proportional to stress amplitude [10]. Zhuang and 
Halford proposed an advanced physics-based relaxation model which 
could take into account parameters like degree of cold working, stress 
ratio and stress gradient, and the results were comparable to those 
predicted by finite element analysis [11]. Smith et al. conducted finite 
element analysis to compare the relaxation effect of the two material 
hardening models [12]. They found out that complex multi-linear model 
had more relaxation than a simple linear hardening model. But the 
predictions were poor compared to measurements in the cyclic loading 
case. Farrahi et al. showed that residual stresses decreased and their 
reduction rate was a function of the cyclic stress level and an inverse 
function of the depth of the plastically deformed surface layer on shot 

Prediction of Residual Stress Relaxation                   Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  331 
peened spring steel specimens [13]. Iida et al. found out that repeated 
cyclic loading caused more relaxation when compared to reverse cyclic 
loading [14]. Boyce et al. investigated relaxation effect due to foreign 
object damage [15]. They found out that damage sites with high stress 
concentrations which were initially under a state of strong compression 
relaxed, and cracks tend to form in these regions. Vasu et al. developed a 
computational methodology to incorporate the relaxation effect into 
fatigue life prediction models [16]. However, very little information is 
available to comprehend the relaxation behavior in laser peened 
components subjected to low cycle fatigue loading conditions. 
 
In this research, we predict the relaxation behavior when material yielding 
occurs due to the combined effect of residual stresses and applied loading. 
Finite element method is used to predict the relaxation behavior. The first 
step is to choose an efficient hardening law. Constitutive models have to 
be robust enough to represent the relaxation mechanism. The mixed 
hardening model has been very useful in accounting the Bauschinger 
effect, a phenomenon that refers to the reduction of flow stress after a 
reversal in strain direction that makes even lower applied loads able to 
generate additional plastic deformation in the material. Experimental test 
for the chosen material is used to obtain the material constants, and can be 
directly input into the simulation to replicate the stress-strain behavior. 
Once experimental data is obtained, finite element laser peening 
simulation is conducted on the fatigue specimen to obtain the residual 
stress profile for analysis. In this research, an axial fatigue problem is 
considered to illustrate the implementation of residual stress relaxation 
occurring on laser peened components. 
 
LASER PEENING MECHANISM 
 
A pictorial representation of laser peening process is shown in Fig. (3). 
The target material is coated with ablative overlay and confined by 
transparent overlay. When the laser pulse impacts the material, the 
absorbent material vaporizes and creates plasma. This plasma which is 
confined by the transparent overlay creates a pressure pulse which is 

332  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Vasu and Grandhi 
propagated into the material as a shock wave. When the stress created by 
shockwave exceeds dynamic yield strength of the material, this results in 
plastic deformation of the surface microstructure generating compressive 
stresses inside the material. Black paint or tape is considered most of the 
time as the opaque overlay while flowing water along the peening surface 
is usually taken as the transparent overlay. Some special features observed 
in the process of laser peening are discussed in this section. The features 
are unique of laser peening among all surface enhancement methods. 
 
Fig. (3). Laser peening process. 
 
Pressure Pulse Generation 
 
The vaporization of heated ablative material by laser beam generates 
plasma. Confined plasma creates shock wave that is propagated into the 
material. The dynamic nature of the shock wave generated by the laser 
beam is represented as a pressure pulse having a temporal as well as a 
spatial profile. The laser pulse generated by the laser source and the 

Prediction of Residual Stress Relaxation                   Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  333 
pressure pulse generated by the shock wave are monitored and the 
temporal profile representing them is shown in Fig. (4) [17]. This pressure 
pulse has unique properties such as high peak pressure and very short 
pulse duration. 
 
Fig. (4). Temporal profile of the laser pulse and the generated pressure pulse. 
 
High Strain Rate Phenomenon 
 
The shock waves generate high strain rates inside the material during the 
laser peening process on the order of 106/sec. These high strain rates can 
play an important role in determining the material behavior. It has been 
experimentally proven that many materials are sensitive to high strain rate 
effects. It requires a higher stress to yield the material in case of high 
strain rates when compared with a quasi-static process. The stress-strain 
curve showing this high strain rate effect can be represented as shown in 
Fig. (5) [18].

Fig. (5). Stress-strain curve showing the strain rate effect. 
 
Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) is a measure to represent the dynamic yield 
stresses due to high strain rate effect. The HEL is the axial stress required to 
plastically deform a material in a uniaxial strain state and is represented as a 
function of dynamic yield strength and Poisson ratio of the material as 
shown in Eq. 1 [19].

When the shock wave propagates into the material, the pressure pulse 
amplitude drops (shock wave attenuation) as it goes deeper into the material. 
When the stress wave magnitude goes below the HEL, no further plasticity 
occurs and the surrounding material representing the elastically deformed 
field compresses the plastically affected region to achieve static 
equilibrium. 
 
Plasticity in Laser Peening 
 
Plasticity experienced in a high strain rate process like laser peening can be 
explained by means of the dependence of plastic strain on impact pressure 

Prediction of Residual Stress Relaxation                   Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  335 
with the use of the HEL as the measure, as illustrated in Fig. (6) [19]. This 
model assumes a Von Mises yield criterion along with a uniform pressure 
along the impact region. The first step involves the elastic loading until the 
HEL is reached. The second step involves plastic loading where plastic 
deformation occurs in the material. The third step is the elastic unloading 
phase and the final step is the plastic unloading phase. When the impact 
pressure is between 1 and 2 HEL, plastic strain can occur with a purely 
elastic reverse strain. When the impact pressure is more than 2 HEL, elastic 
reverse strain gets saturated and plastic reverse strain occurs. If the impact 
pressures are of the order of 2.5 HEL or more, this can result in the 
spallation on the material. Hence impact pressure should be optimized to 
obtain best results. Theoretically, a load of 2 HEL should give the 
maximum compressive residual stress according to Fig. (1.15). If the load is 
beyond 1 HEL, permanent plastic deformation occurs. When the load is 
between 1 and 2 HEL, as the plastic strain increases, the compressive 
residual stress also increases.

FINITE ELEMENT MODELING OF LASER PEENING 
 
2D Axisymmetric finite element models can predict the residual stresses for 
one shot laser peening process. However, 3D models are required to predict 
the residual stresses for a realistic application scenario. The details of the 
2D and 3D FEA models have been described by the authors before [20, 21].

This section discusses the important parameters considered while 
conducting the modeling and analysis of laser peening. 
 
Pressure Pulse Input 
 
The temporal profile of the shock wave is constructed similar to the sharp 
rise time pulse profile obtained from experimental testing as shown in Fig. 
(7). Although non-homogeneity is observed along the spatial profile of the 
laser shot impact, the effect on the peak pressure is fairly small [22]. This 
research considers the initial condition of laser power density, which is 
uniformly distributed along the laser spot with the same area dimensions for 
all three geometries. A uniform spatial profile over the spot is used for the 
current investigations.

Simulation Procedure 
 
Laser peening simulation process can be divided into two stages. The first 
stage involves the generation of pressure pulses by high-energy plasma, 
which can be explained by laser physics. The second stage incorporates 

Prediction of Residual Stress Relaxation                   Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  337 
the plastic deformation on the surface of the material induced by the 
shock waves generated by the pulse pressure [23]. Our interest is to model 
the second stage of the process using a finite element model to obtain the 
residual stress field induced in the material. The conventional method 
involves an integrated approach using both explicit and implicit solving 
techniques to predict the shock wave phenomenon imparted to the 
material. However, this “explicit-implicit” procedure becomes difficult to 
implement for 3D finite element simulations with a large number of laser 
shots. Each shot takes more than 1 day (~ 40 CPU hours) to simulate a 
finite element model encompassing 0.5 million elements at the Ohio 
Supercomputing Center (OSC) Facility. At OSC multiple nodes of quad 
core 2.5 GHz Opteron 24 GB RAM are available to perform the analysis. 
A modified explicit procedure is a good approximation to reduce the 
computational time, as shown in Fig. (8). In this “modified explicit” 
procedure, the explicit solver is run for a short duration until a steady 
dynamic stress state is reached for each laser peening shot (when kinetic 
energy approaches zero). For the final shot, an extended explicit 
simulation time replaces the time consuming force equilibrium analysis 
(implicit part). The modified explicit procedure is suggested based on the 
observation that the redistribution of residual stress field becomes weak 
when a steady dynamic stress state is reached. The details of the 
procedure and the comparison of its performance have been discussed 
before [21].

Constitutive Model 
 
The strain rate for laser peening is in the order of 106 /second. In order to 
give an accurate prediction of the material response, temperature effects 
as well as the effect of strain rate on the flow stress should be included in 
the constitutive model. The Johnson-Cook model has been an efficient 
material model to deal with high strain rate processes and is used for all 
the finite element simulations in the present work [24]. According to the 
Johnson-Cook strength model, the equivalent Von Mises stress is given 
by:

Constant A is the yield stress at 0.2% offset strain; Constant B and 
exponent n represent the strain hardening effect. The expression in the 
second bracket represents the strain rate effect through constant C. Model 
constants A, B, n and C are determined from experimental data in the 
form of room temperature stress-strain curves at specific strain rates. It 
can be observe that, the thermal term has been neglected from the 
Johnson cook material model. The absorbent layer can protect the 
material surface from thermal effects of laser irradiation. It not only 
prevents the part surface from the direct laser ablation, but also prevents 
the thermal effect propagating into the specimen; hence the thermal term 
is dropped. More discussion will be given in the next section. 
 
Effect of Temperature in Laser Peening Process 
 
The heat effect is not considered in the simulation because the absorbent 
layer can protect the material surface from thermal effect during laser 
peening. Sources of heat in laser peening to consider include laser 
irradiation of the material and temperature rise due to the plastic strain 
caused by shock waves. The heat penetration depth dp shown in Fig. (9) 
due to the nanosecond laser irradiation is given by:

Taking black paint as an example of the absorbent layer, the heat diffusion 
coefficient is D = 2.1*10-7 m2/s. If it is irradiated by a 20 ns laser beam, 
the heat penetration depth would be on the order of 0.065 μm. The layer 
thickness used in the laser peening process is usually tens of micrometers. 
Therefore, the ablative layer not only prevents the part surface from the 
direct laser ablation, but also prevents the thermal effect propagating into 
the specimen.

Shock waves generated by the laser pulse create compression in the 
material resulting in temperature rise. A thermo-mechanical finite element 
analysis is conducted on Ti-6Al-4V material (flat geometry, spot radius = 
2.5 mm, initial temperature = 25°C, melting temperature = 1660°C). A 2D 
axisymmetric model is used to perform this analysis [25]. As the pressure 
pulse goes beyond 8 GPa, we can see the spike in temperature in the 
material as shown in Fig. (10). We can also observe that, in the laser

peening operating range (3-6 GPa related to HEL), maximum temperature 
observed is around 121 °C. The Johnson-Cook material constants for 
Ti-6Al-4V are shown in Table 1.

To see how the temperature rise affects the residual stress in the material, 
a peak pressure of 5.5GPa (~2HEL) is applied to the material. The 
residual stress imparted to the material on the surface as well as the depth 
direction are shown in Fig. (11). The results indicate that the effect of 
temperature due to laser peening in its operating conditions is small and 
hence temperature effect needs not be considered to model the laser 
peening process.

Curvature Effect 
 
The finite element modeling simulation conducted to demonstrate the 
significance of curvature effects is illustrated in Fig. (12) for Ti-6Al-4V 
(Rc = 7.64 mm for convex and concave geometries). A difference in peak 
compressive residual stress of 300 MPa (greater than 30%) is observed. 
This big difference in magnitude should not be neglected since the 
assumption of flat geometry can lead to incorrect residual stress

prediction, which can be detrimental in fatigue life estimation. Note that 
the differences, though significant, only concern the surface layer of the 
depth mostly within 0.05 - 0.1 mm; beyond this depth, the differences 
start to become less significant or even negligible. We can also observe 
the reduction of compressive residual stress on surface around the spot 
center, which can be attributed to the stress focusing due to Raleigh waves 
[23].

RESIDUAL STRESS RELAXATION 
 
The residual state just after peening should not be directly taken into 
fatigue analysis. Residual stresses generated by laser peening or any other 
surface enhancement method on structural components will have to deal 
with complex loads during their life cycle. The cyclic fatigue loading, as 
well as elevated temperature, can take off the beneficial effect of the 
surface enhancement methods significantly. This phenomenon of stress 
instability is called stress relaxation. There are three different ways to 
impart relaxation to peened components. The first one is termed as 
thermal stress relaxation, which occurs when the surface treated 
components are exposed to elevated temperature [26]. The second 
mechanism is called the static relaxation, which arises when the sum of 
the residual stress and the applied load exceeds the yield criterion of the 
material [27]. The third way to yield stress relaxation is through repeated 
fatigue cycles and is the most prominent method among all three. This 
process is called cyclic stress relaxation and can happen even when there 
is no macroscopic plastic deformation. It should also be noted that 

344  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Vasu and Grandhi 
relaxation can happen as a combination of these three relaxation 
mechanisms, but the scope of this research is confined to stress relaxation 
resulting from a cyclic load. Depending on the magnitude of loading, the 
residual stress field can undergo relaxation and redistribution if the 
loading exceeds yielding criterion. Relaxation can also occur due to micro 
plasticity effects. A pictorial representation of the cyclic stress relaxation 
effect on a surface treated component is shown in Fig. (13). 
 
Fig. (14). Two phases in determining the relaxation effect. 
 
The main parameters which can influence stress relaxation are the number 
of cycles, load amplitude, stress ratio, and degree of cold working [11]. 
Compared to shot peening, the effect of cold working is low in the case of 
laser peening [28]. A framework has been constructed to determine the 
relaxation behavior as shown in Fig. (14). It can be divided into two 

Prediction of Residual Stress Relaxation                   Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  345 
phases. The first phase is the peening phase where residual stresses are 
generated in the model by the laser peening. An advanced 
modified-explicit procedure is employed for simulating the multi-shot 
laser peening process. The second phase involves the relaxation effect 
where the residual stress is subjected to cyclic loading. Based on the 
number of cycles applied onto the material, we can solve the problem 
using FE models or available empirical/analytical models. The division is 
based on two categories of fatigue failure, namely Low Cycle Fatigue 
(LCF) and High Cycle Fatigue (HCF). LCF relaxation can be predicted 
by finite element simulation models while HCF relaxation can be 
predicted by already existing analytical models. The prediction of stress 
relaxation with FE models has been detailed in this section. 
 
Obtain Empirical Data for Calibration 
 
In order to conduct the numerical simulation, we require material 
parameters defining the hardening model. An axial fatigue problem is 
considered. Boyce conducted strain-controlled test to measure the cyclic 
stress-strain behavior of Ti-6Al-4V [15]. The experimental specimen and 
the stress-strain behavior are shown in Fig. (15).

Boyce measured the stress-strain behavior for 5 cycles, and a functional 
fit to the data yields the parameters which can be directly input in to 
ABAQUS to define the hardening behavior of the material. The hardening

calibrated from the cyclic testing data and are given by C1 = 1.38x1011 and 
γ=635. 
 
FE Modeling of Stress Relaxation 
 
The numerical modeling can be broken down into two steps. The first step 
is to laser peen the specimen to obtain the residual stress field. The 
importance of curved geometry is taken into consideration while 
modeling the residual stress imparted to the specimen. To make a good 
representation of the real problem, multi-shot laser peening with 
overlapping is conducted on a 3D convex model and the individual stress 
components for each element are imported into the 2D axisymmetric FE 
model as prestress. This task of modeling the initial residual stress field is 
performed with the use of SIGNI.f, a user subroutine in abaqus. Step 1 is 
shown in Fig. (16). 
 
The second step is to apply fatigue load on the laser peened specimen. 
Variable amplitude loading such as that obtained from FALSTAFF can be 
used to describe the loading spectrum. But for the simplicity of the 
procedure of calculating the cyclic response due to loading magnitudes, 
constant amplitude loading is considered for this research. Step 2 is

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Residual stress response for a maximum stress of 200 MPa and 
completely reversible loading are shown in the Fig. (18) along the 
longitudinal and transverse directions. The red line in both graphs 
represents the initial residual stresses. We can observe significant 
relaxation in both directions. The relaxation phenomenon is dominant in 
the initial cycles and gradually there is no change in the residual stresses 
after a certain number of cycles. We can not only see relaxation of 
compressive residual stresses, but also the relaxation of tensile stresses as 
we move along the depth. These trends correlate well with the 
experimental results conducted on shot peening fatigue specimen.

Fig. (19) shows the residual stress in the longitudinal and transverse 
directions for a completely reversible loading condition with different 
maximum stresses. We can observe that, as the maximum stress gets 
higher, relaxation becomes significant in both directions. For a repeated 
loading case scenario, the relaxation effect is minimal. This indicates that 
compressive loading is the driving force for the relaxation of residual 
stresses produced by methods like laser peening.

CONCLUSION 
 
Numerical models are constructed in ABAQUS to simulate the relaxation 
behavior of laser peened residual stresses in Ti-6Al-4V. Three 
dimensional multi-shot laser peening is conducted on a concave specimen 
representative of the gauge section of the fatigue specimen. The residual 
stresses obtained from laser peening are used in the two-dimensional 
axisymmetric model as an initial residual stress field. The experimental 
results obtained from a strain-controlled test for an axial fatigue problem 
are used to construct a mixed hardening model representing the cyclic 

350  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                     Vasu and Grandhi 
hardening behavior of the material. The results from the simulation 
models indicate that relaxation has a significant effect, especially in the 
initial cycles for the axial fatigue problem, at higher load levels, while 
minimal relaxation is observed at lower load levels. The effects of 
relaxation in different loading conditions are investigated. It is found that 
the compressive fatigue cycles play an important role in the relaxation of 
compressive residual stresses.

Abstract: The aerospace industry has utilized high strength aluminum alloys to 
propel the production and manufacturing of advanced aerospace technology; 
however, welding of Aluminum and its constituent alloys introduce challenges which 
affect the structural integrity of the welded area if conducted indecorously. For this 
reason, Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) of welded areas is conducted to ascertain 
defective regions to ensure structural integrity of the aerospace structure. NDE 
techniques are noninvasive and can determine whether the object contains 
irregularities, discontinuities, or flaws. Inspecting weld areas allows for cost 
reduction by detecting discontinuities in the early stages of manufacturing; 
consequently, reducing the time and money to rework the error and allows for the 
validation of sound welds. A variety of NDE techniques are available depending on 
the applications, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Among the 
number of NDE techniques, radiography and ultrasonics are the most widely utilized 
for inspection of weld defects. In this study, a detailed analysis was thereby 
conducted to ascertain the critical phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) parameters 
for the detection of weld defects, more specifically with Friction-Stir-Welding (FSW). 
Consequently a comparison to X-ray radiography is also included. It was observed

1.0mm; however, it was found that PAUT was the only technique able to discover 
defects in the range of 0.15 mm.

INTRODUCTION 
Welding is an essential manufacturing process performed in almost every 
major industry; however, in many welding techniques flaws or defects are 
quite common in the welded joints. These defects can be found in the 
form of surface or sub-surface cracks, undercut, porosity, or inclusions 
[1-3]; and consequently, failure can occur from these flaws [4]. An 
important decision must be made regarding severity of these weld defects 
and their effect on the strength; therefore, weld quality and integrity are 
critical to safety in an extremely wide range of products and structures, 
especially in the aerospace industry. To ensure sound welds have been 
forged, Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques can be employed to 
determine if defects have formed [5]. Different NDE methods can identify 
cracking, porosity, incomplete penetration, misalignment, inclusions, and 
lack of fusion which all can compromise weld strength and eventually 
structural integrity under dynamic loading conditions. 
 
NDE techniques are utilized in a multitude of scenarios including: 
Determination whether an object is acceptable after each fabrication step 
(in-process inspection), determining whether an object is acceptable for 
final use (Final inspection), and lastly, determining whether an existing 
object already in use is acceptable for continued uses (in-service 
inspection). To summarize, NDE is applied to find welding defects as well 
as quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) of welded structures [6]. 
The most common NDE techniques to conduct various inspections are: 

356  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Dewan et al. 
Ultrasonic Testing (UT), Radiographic Testing (RT), Liquid Penetrant 
Testing (LPT), Magnetic Particle Testing (MT), Eddy Current Testing 
(ET), and Acoustic Emission (AE) testing. Each NDE technique discussed 
previously has distinct advantages and disadvantages; consequently, 
depending on the application one technique may be better suited than 
another. Table 1 briefly illustrates NDE techniques and their principle of 
operation, applications, limitations, advantages, and welding defects that 
can be determined. It is noted that NDE techniques rely heavily on human 
skills and knowledge to correctly assess and interpret results. Proper and 
adequate training, developing confidence, and appropriate certifications 
are required to perform non-destructive testing (NDT) [7, 8]. Therefore, 
flaws or defects are often dictated by a code or requirement which 
indicates acceptable tolerances, i.e. The American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers Pressure Vessel Code [9] and American Welding Society 
Structural Welding Code [10-12]. 
 
Among the number of NDE techniques, ultrasonics and radiography are 
the most widely used for checking for weld defects. In recent years, the 
conventional ultrasonic testing technique has been replaced with more 
reliable and technologically advanced techniques of Phased Array 
Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) and Time of Flight Diffraction (TOFD). 
Alternatively, radiography is utilized providing a range of techniques 
from traditional X-ray generators and film to newer technologies such as 
Computed Radiography (CR), Direct Radiography (DR), and 3D 
Computed Tomography (CT). These new technologies allow for remote 
visual inspection and enhancement of data visualization.

 ULTRASONIC TESTING (UT) 
 
Ultrasonic testing has become a widely used NDE technique with many 
advancements and variations. Ultrasonic testing can be used to detect 
(Table 1) contd.....

358  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Dewan et al. 
cracks, voids, and changes in geometric and material parameters such as: 
thickness, stress concentration, and modulus [13]. In ultrasonic testing, 
high frequency ultrasound vibrations are generated from piezoelectric 
elements and thereby transmitted into test specimens. The transmitted high 
frequency waves are reflected or scattered by discontinuities inside the 
material as the waves propagate. The piezoelectric elements also act as 
receivers which detect the ultrasonic reflections from the discontinuities. 
 
FUNDAMENTALS OF ULTRASONIC TESTING 
 
In solids, sound waves can propagate in four principle methods that are 
established by fundamental particle oscillation principles. Sound can pro- 
pagate as longitudinal waves, shear waves, surface waves, and plate 
waves. Longitudinal and shear waves are the two modes of sound wave 
propagation most commonly used in ultrasonic testing. In longitudinal 
waves, the oscillations occur in the longitudinal direction or the direction 
of wave propagation. In the transverse or shear wave, the particles 
oscillate at a right angle or transverse to the direction of wave propagation. 
Three important properties of sound waves propagating in isotropic solid 
materials are: wavelength (𝜆), frequency (𝑓), and velocity (𝑉). The 
wavelength is directly proportional to the velocity of the wave and 
inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave. This relationship is 
shown below in Eq. (1). The wavelength is related to defect detection 
capabilities, which vary with ultrasonic transducer capabilities. Generally 
the measurable smallest defect size should be larger than one half of the 
wavelength. In general, a defect size must be larger than one-half the 
wavelength in order to be detected. Therefore, if a material’s velocity 
remains constant, by increasing the frequency the size of λ will decrease 
which will result in smaller defects that can be found; hence, low 
frequency probes can overlook defects and can cause an operator to 
believe that a defect-free weld has been conducted.

(1) 
The speed of sound (𝑉) within a material is a function of the properties 
of the material and is independent of the amplitude of the sound wave. 
The general relationship between the speed of sound in a solid and its 
density and elastic constants is shown in Eq. (2). Ultrasonic velocity is 
constant for each material. 
𝑉= √
𝐶𝑖𝑗
𝜌 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
Where, elastic constant Cij is Young's modulus (E), Poisson’s ratio(𝜇), or 
shear modulus (𝐺), depending on the type of sound wave. When 
calculating the velocity of a longitudinal wave, Young's Modulus and 
Poisson's Ratio are commonly used. When calculating the velocity of a 
shear wave, the shear modulus is used. 
 
Sensitivity and resolutions are two important ultrasonic properties 
generally used to describe the ability to locate flaws during testing. 
Sensitivity is the ability to find small defects and resolution is the ability 
to detect flaws that are close together within the materials. Generally 
sensitivity and resolution of an ultrasonic probe increases with the 
increase of frequency. On the other hand, as frequency increases, sound 
tends to scatter from large or coarse grain structure and from small 
imperfections within a material. Before selecting an inspection frequency, 
the material's grain structure and thickness, and the discontinuity's type, 
size, and probable location should be considered. 
 
During ultrasonic testing, the sound waves generally originate from a 
number of the piezoelectric transducer surface rather than a single point. 
Due to multiple waves, the ultrasound intensity along the beam is affected 
by constructive and destructive wave interference. The wave interference 
results extensive variations in the sound intensity near the source and it is 

360  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Dewan et al. 
known as near field. Because of intensity fluctuations within near field, it 
is difficult to accurately estimate defect size when a defect is located 
within this area. The area beyond the near-field where the ultrasonic beam 
is more uniform is called the far-field [14-16]. In the far-field, the beam 
spreads out in a pattern originating from the center of the transducer and 
sound waves have maximum strength. Therefore, optimal detection 
results will be obtained when flaws occur in the far-field area. Near-field 
distance (𝑁) can be expressed as Eq. (3). Ultrasonic wedges helps to focus 
the defect in far-field area for thin metal inspection. Schematic of near-field 
and far-field is shown in Fig. (1).

Where, 𝐷 is the probe diameter, 𝑓 is the probe frequency, and 𝑉 is the

The energy in the ultrasonic beam does not remain in a cylinder, but 
instead, spreads out as it propagates through the material. The 
phenomenon is usually referred to as beam-spread but is sometimes also 

Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)                       Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  361 
referred to as beam-divergence or ultrasonic diffraction. Beam-spread is 
twice the beam-divergence (see Fig. 2 below). It occurs because the 
vibrating particles of the material do not always transfer all of their 
energy in the direction of wave propagation. Beam-spread is largely 
determined by the frequency and diameter of the transducer. Beam-spread 
is greater when using a low frequency transducer than when using a high 
frequency transducer. As the diameter of the transducer increases, the 
beam-spread will be reduced. Eq. (4) is used to calculate the beam- 
divergence angle (θ). Larger beam-divergence results over- estimation of a 
defect size. Fig. (2) illustrates beam-divergence and beam-spread during 
ultrasonic inspection.

Ultrasonic technology in general, can be classified into three categories: 
conventional ultrasonic testing (UT), time-of-flight-diffraction (TOFD) 
ultrasonic testing, and phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT). Fig. (3) 
illustrates PAUT, TOFD, and UT configurations designed with 
ESBeamTool software. The basis of all UT inspection is A-scan data. 
A-scan waveforms represent the reflections from one sound beam 
position in the test piece (various illustrations for A-scan views are 
discussed later). A-scan data are used to generate other scan views 

362  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Dewan et al. 
including B, C, and S-scan views which allow better representation of 
inspection data and defects. The B-scan is an image showing a 
cross-sectional profile through one vertical slice of the test piece, showing 
the depth of reflectors with respect to their linear position. The C-scan is a 
two dimensional presentation of data displayed as a top or planar view of 
a test piece. The S-scan or sectorial scan image represents a 
two-dimensional cross-sectional view derived from a series of A-scans 
that have been plotted with respect to time delay and refracted angle. Fig. 
(4) illustrates B, C, and S-scan patterns of ultrasonic testing.

CONVENTIONAL ULTRASONIC TESTING (UT) 
 
A typical conventional ultrasonic inspection system consists of several 
functional units, such as a pulser/receiver, transducer, and display device. 
A pulser/receiver is an electronic device that produces high voltage 
electrical pulses. Driven by the pulser, the transducer utilizing the 
piezoelectric elements converts the electrical pulses into mechanical 
energy in the form of ultrasonic vibrations. When there is a discontinuity 
in the wave path, part of the energy will be reflected back from the flaw 
surface. The reflected wave signal is transformed into an electrical signal 
by the transducer and is displayed on a screen. The reflected signal 
strength is displayed versus time. Signal travel time can be directly related 
to the distance that the signal traveled. From the signal, information about 
the reflector location, size, and orientation are acquired. The conventional 
UT method scanning process is time consuming. The presentation of 

364  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Dewan et al. 
defects is obtained from A-scan data and documentation of the defect 
position has to be calculated manually. Inspections with more than one 
angle require sequential operations, which also increases the inspection 
time. One important aspect of conventional ultrasonic testing is to calculate 
the size and location of the inspected defect. Fig. (5) illustrates a schematic 
of weld defect detection using angle beam ultrasonic testing. Fig. (6) shows 
the corresponding A-scan view.

For A-Scan data, an ultrasonic echo will be found in between the front 
and back wall echoes versus travel time (∆𝑡). For the particular material, 
sound velocity (𝑉) is known. Accordingly, the sound path can be 
calculated using Eq. (5). 
 
𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑕= (∆𝑡 × 𝑉)/2

Now, if the reflection angle (𝜃𝑅) and material thickness (𝑇) is known, the 
location of the defect can be calculated using the following equations: 
 
𝑆𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒= 𝑆𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑅× 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑕

𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑕= 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑅× 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑕

TIME-OF-FLIGHT-DIFFRACTION 
(TOFD) 
ULTRASONIC 
TESTING 
 
Time-Of-Flight-Diffraction (TOFD) is another important version of 
ultrasonic testing. In TOFD, a single element angled beam with one pulser 
and receiver is used to obtain A and B scan views to represent defects. Fig. 
(7) illustrates a schematic of the TOFD process and the A and B scan 
views that are acquired. TOFD images can be corrupted by incorrect setup 
parameters such as gain value, gate setup, transducer separation, 
transducer positions from weld center or other problems such as electrical 
noise [9]. At lower gain levels diffracted signals can become undetectable. 
At high gain values noise levels increase which obscures the diffracted 
signals leading to reduced probability of detection and poor sizing. 
Correct gate settings are critical, because in TOFD A-scans are not that 
easy to interpret since there are multiple visible signals. As a minimum, 
the gates should cover the lateral wave and longitudinal wave’s first 
back-wall signal. If the transducer separation distance is too large the 
back-wall and lateral wave signal weaken, causing the diffracted signal 

366  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Dewan et al. 
amplitudes to drop. If the transducer separation distance is too close, the 
lateral wave signals become large and the back-wall signals become weak. 
If the transducers are not centered on the weld, the diffracted signal 
amplitudes will decline to the point where flaw detection is seriously 
impaired. As discussed previously, noise levels can seriously impair 
TOFD interpretation. The generation of noise can come from a number of 
sources such as electrical interference, ultrasonic focusing depth, gain 
values, and coupling. One main challenge of TOFD analysis is the data 
interpretation and classification of defects. Table 2 represents some 
typical welding defects and corresponding TOFD scan views.

PHASED ARRAY ULTRASONIC TESTING (PAUT) 
 
PAUT is relatively a new ultrasonic testing technology and greatly 
decreases the level of difficulty in determining welding defects. 
Ultrasonic phased arrays eventually replaced conventional ultrasonic 
methods in many nondestructive evaluation applications [19-21]. Phased 
arrays offer increased inspection sensitivity and coverage, as well as 
decreasing inspection times compared with the conventional ultrasonic 
techniques using single and multi-element transducers. Another benefit of 
phased array systems is their ability to produce immediate images 
allowing straightforward visualization of the internal structure of a 
component thereby simplifying data interpretation. By using PAUT 
technology an operator is better prepared to determine the size, shape, and 
orientation of a defect versus traditional pulse echo UT techniques [22, 
23]. 
 
PAUT has three distinct components. Firstly, the probe (transducer) which 
functions as the transmitter and receiver of the high frequency sound 
waves. Phased array ultrasonic probes utilize an array of piezoelectric 
elements that in sequence generate high frequency sound waves. 
Transducer frequencies are most commonly found to be in the range of 2 
MHz to 10 MHz [24]. The probe is mounted on top of a wedge 
component which couples the sound waves generated by the probe to the 
work piece. Wedges are also used to steer the sound waves at a certain 
angle as they enter the work-piece according to Snell’s Law. The couplant, 
typically a moderately viscous, nontoxic liquid or gel, is used between the 
wedge and the work-piece to facilitate the transmission of sound energy 
between the wedge and the test piece. Lastly, a data acquisition unit is 
used to generate images that can utilize the sound waves to determine 
defects of a material. These data acquisition units are very sophisticated 
and have many input variables that will affect the images produced. In Fig. 
(8), an illustration is given of a probe/wedge unit that is situated on top of 

Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)                       Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  369 
a Friction-Stir-Weld with a defect located on the upper advancing side. 
During one firing sequence, each element is engaged beginning in the 
direction of the arrow starting from A and ending at B (shown on the 
probe). With the associated wedge angle and firing sequence, a wave front 
is created following Huygen’s interference patterns [24, 25] allowing 
defects to be found in a large area. For simplicity only the “first leg” of 
the wave front is illustrated. In practical applications, one can use 
multiple legs and can view larger swept areas. 
 
 
Fig. (8). A typical probe and wedge configuration with illustration of wave propagation inside a 
friction stir (FS) welded specimen. 
 
For PAUT inspection, multiple input parameters must be entered into the 
data acquisition unit to accurately determine defect sizes and locations. 
These variables include the characteristics of the transducer, wedge, and 
welded area. Setup variables also include parameters that assist in 
generating an accurate focal law for the high frequency sound waves. 

370  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Dewan et al. 
These parameters include scan type, wave type, number of elements to be 
viewed, beam angle, and gate settings. Lastly, one of the most important 
procedures that need to be conducted is “calibration”. Different types of 
calibration blocks (ASTM, PACS, IIW, NAVSHIP, etc.) are utilized 
depending on the application and defect code. Calibration blocks should 
be made of the same material that is to be inspected [26]. In the 
calibration procedure, many steps are required that have to be followed in 
a particular order to allow for the system to calculate correct wave 
characteristics. In general, three procedures have to be conducted. These 
include the material velocity, wedge delay, and sensitivity calibrations. In 
the calibrations, three different types of reflectors can be used to verify 
velocity and wedge delay variables which include radius, depth, and 
thickness. If one is using an angle-beam wedge, the radius and depth 
reflectors must be utilized; however, if a 0 degree wedge is employed then 
the thickness reflector (back-wall reflection) can be used. 
 
The sound waves are predictable due to wave physics principles. These 
wave principles are classical physics phenomena and have been well 
documented as they pertain to ultrasonics, as seen in [27-34]. Work has 
also been conducted to determine the effect of element size in linear 
phased arrays [35]. Optimization of PAUT probe design has likewise been 
discussed in [36, 37]. Simulations of PAUT systems have been conducted 
to predict phased array ultrasonic wave interactions and behavior inside 
materials in [38-40]. With this new technology, simulation software has 
been developed to aid in the scanning process to create the required 
PAUT software to accurately detect defects. A requirement is to describe 
the inspection task and enter fundamental information such as site 
location, number of welds, pipe diameter, thickness, material properties, 
weld preparation, procedure, and ultrasonic method to be used. The 
software will then calculate and generate all the UT set-up parameters 
required to perform Phased Array inspection of the welds. 
 

Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)                       Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  371 
As mentioned earlier the most common scan views (images) that a PAUT 
system utilizes are A, B, C, and S scans. If there is a defect present in the 
scanned samples, it can be visualized with 6-dB color change [25, 41, 42]. 
Fig. (9) shows typical A, S, and C-scan views obtained from phased array 
ultrasonic testing. The S-scan is perhaps the most useful asset to current 
PAUT post-weld evaluation due to the ability to steer the sound waves in 
a range of angles which allows for easy visualization of a specimen [20]. 
The horizontal axis corresponds to location of the defect from probe 
position, and the vertical axis to depth of the test piece. During inspection, 
the inspection data for each weld is stored into the memory. The location 
can be identified by incorporating an encoder or scanner. After inspection, 
a sophisticated software package is employed allowing a qualified 
ultrasonic inspector to review and analyze the inspection data utilizing 
advanced analysis tools such as: real time volume corrected imaging, as 
well as, conventional image analysis, image enhancement, and 
measurement determination.

Defect Sizing Using PAUT 
 
Defect sizing capabilities of the PAUT unit was examined using the 
Olympus OmniScan MX2.0 unit and TomoView software version 2.10. For 
defect sizing, two important parameters need to be considered: (i) gain 
and (ii) index offset. In this study, defects were measured with (-2 dB), (-3 
dB), and (-6 dB) color drop techniques and was compared with actual 
defect sizes. Higher gain value results in higher A-scan amplitude; and 
higher A-scan amplitude leads to oversize estimation. It is also observed 
that the higher color drop (-6 dB) technique implies larger defect sizing 
compared to smaller color drop (-2 dB) techniques. Hence, during 
post-weld inspection the defect size is dependent on the peak A-scan 
amplitude and color drop technique (Fig. 10). The index offset is the 
distance of the tip of the wedge from the weld-centerline. For constant 
A-scan amplitude, a higher index offset results in higher defect size 
estimation (Fig. 11).

Another important calibration parameter is Time-Corrected-Gain (TCG). 
If the TCG calibration is not performed, the A-scan amplitude will 
decrease with the increase of index offset, which results in defect size 
estimation errors. After TCG calibration, A-scan peak amplitude remains 
constant with the variation of index offset (Fig. 12).

To find the detectability and defect sizing capability of PAUT, varying 
sizes (0.79 mm, 1.58 mm, 1.98 mm, 2.38 mm, 2.78 mm, 4.76 mm, and 
6.35 mm diameters) of seven holes were prepared on an AA6061-T651 
plate and scanned with a calibrated PAUT unit. Fig. (13) shows the 
C-scan view of the plate with varying-hole sizes. The PAUT unit can 
precisely detect the sizes and locations of the holes. To identify the defect 
sizing precision and accuracy of PAUT, different size side-drilled-holes 
(SDH) were bored into an Aluminum Alloy (AA) 2xxx block at varying 
depths and were measured. The variation in measurement is shown in 
Table 3. Absolute error in height, depth, and location sizing was 
0.24±0.20, 0.28±0.18, and 0.46±0.17 respectively. It is generally accepted 
that the tolerance for PAUT is 0.5-1.0 mm depending on how stringent the 
application requirement [13]. It is observed that there is overestimation 
for thicker plates and underestimation for thinner plates. This exemplifies 
one of the characteristics of waves propagating through a material. For a 
defect at larger thicknesses, the sound waves travel a larger distance 
which causes the wave to expand.

This results in the elongation of the defect image; alternatively, for defects 
at smaller depths, the wave has not reached its focal length and thereby 
underestimates the defect. In other words the defect image depends on the 
near and far fields focusing distances of the wave. These results indicate 
that PAUT has the ability to accurately detect defect sizes and locations.

Case Study: Welding Defect Detection with PAUT 
 
In a previous study, PAUT was applied to find and classify welding 
defects in Tungsten-Inert-Gas (TIG, also known as GTAW) welded 
aluminum alloy AA6061-T651 plates [43]. Non-destructively measured 
defects were classified into three different categories and compared with 
microscopic defect sizing. PAUT defect sizing correlates well with 
destructive measurements (Fig. 14). PAUT was also applied to detect 
flaws in Friction-Stir-Welds (FSW). These friction stir (FS) welds were 
executed utilizing varying weld parameters (plunge or forge force, travel 
speed, and spindle speed). Fig. (15) illustrates a FS weld that has incurred 
a surface defect located on the advancing side (AS) of the weld. Another

example in Fig. (16) illustrates a FS weld that has incurred an internal 
defect located on the advancing side (AS) of the weld. The defect found 
from Fig. (16) was measured to be in the range of 0.15 mm. After 
scanning with the PAUT unit, the defect sizes and locations were verified 
with optical microscopy (OM) which confirms that PAUT can be 
successfully applied to find ‘on the surface’ and embedded internal 
defects.

RADIOGRAPHIC TESTING (RT) 
 
One of the widely used NDT methods for volumetric examination is 
radiography. In radiography, X-rays or gamma-rays are used to produce a 
radiographic image obtaining differences in thickness, defects (internal 
and surface), and changes in structure. The procedure for producing a 
radiograph is to have a source of penetrating (ionizing) radiation (X-rays 
or gamma-rays) on one side of a specimen to be examined and a detector 
of the radiation (radiographic film) on the other side, as shown in Fig. 
(17).

FUNDAMENTALS OF RADIOGRAPHIC TESTING 
 
Different radioactive materials and X-ray generators produce radiation at 
different energy levels and at different rates. It is important to understand 
the terms used to describe the energy and intensity of the radiation. The 
energy of a single wavelength X-ray can be calculated by the Eq. (8). 
 
𝐸= 𝑕. 𝜗=
𝑕𝑐
𝜆 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(8) 
 

Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)                       Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  379 
Where, 𝐸 is the energy, 𝑕 is Planck’s constant, 𝜗 is frequency, and c is 
velocity of electromagnetic radiation, and 𝜆 is the wavelength. 
The energy of the radiation is responsible for its ability to penetrate matter. 
Higher energy radiation can penetrate more and higher density matter 
than low energy radiation. Radiation intensity is the amount of energy 
passing through a given area that is perpendicular to the direction of 
radiation travel in a given unit of time. The penetrating intensity can be 
expressed as Eq. (9). 
 
𝐼= 𝐼0. 𝑒−𝜇𝑡  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(9) 
 
In which, 𝐼0 is intensity at material entry, 𝐼 is intensity at materials exit, 𝜇 
total absorption coefficient, and 𝑡 is materials thickness. 
 
The relation between intensity and distance according to the Newton's 
Inverse Square Law can be expresses as Eq. (10). 
 
𝐼1𝑑1
2 = 𝐼2𝑑2
2   
 
 
 
 
      (10) 
 
Where, 𝐼1and 𝐼2 are intensities at distances 𝑑1 and 𝑑2 from the source, 
respectively. Source to film distance (𝐹) can be calculated from the Eq. 
(11). 
 
𝐹=
𝑡(𝑈𝑡+4𝑠)
𝑈𝑡
  
 
 
 
 
 
      (11) 
 
Where, s is effective source size, t is the object thickness, and 𝑈𝑡 is total 
un-sharpness which can be expressed (see Eq. 12) in-terms of film 
un-sharpness (Uf) and geometric un-sharpness (Ug).

Presently, a wide range of industrial radiographic equipment, image 
forming techniques, and examination methods are available. Similar to 
ultrasonic NDE methods, knowledge and experience are needed to select 
the appropriate method for a particular application. Generally for weld 
inspection, the methodology will follow ASTM-E1032 standards [45] 
with associated safety requirements [10]. The radiographic sensitivity 
shall be judged based on a penetrometer or wire image quality indicators 
(IQI). The results of the X-ray image produce a two dimensional 
representation of the specimen. In a radiographic film, darkness of the 
film vary according to the amount of radiation that has reached the film 
through the test object. In radiographic film, darker areas indicate more 
exposure and lighter areas indicate less exposure. The processed film (or 
image) is usually viewed by placing it in front of a screen providing white 
light illumination of uniform intensity so that the light is transmitted 
through the film and the image can be clearly seen. The term 
“radiographic density” is a measure of the degree of film darkening. 
Radiographic density is the logarithm of two measurements: the intensity 
of light incident on the film (𝐼0) and the intensity of light transmitted 
through the film (𝐼𝑡).

       (13) 
 
One important challenge of radiographic analysis is the data interpretation 
and defect classification. For this reason, X-ray images that are acquired 
are compared with standard radiographic images [9, 44]. Table 4 
illustrates typical welding defects and corresponding radiographic images.

Case Study: Welding Defect Detection with RT 
 
In the current study FS welded plates were analyzed employing digital 
X-ray radiography and compared with PAUT results. Fig. (18) illustrates 
a representation of the X-ray images of internal and surface defects in the 
FS welded plates. It is shown that X-ray radiography can be successfully 
applied to locate the surface-defects and embedded internal defects.

Comparison of PAUT and RT to Obtain Welding Defect 
 
A comparison of the two most prominent techniques, PAUT and X-ray 
radiography, defect detection capabilities was conducted utilizing various 
FS welded specimens. It was observed that both methods easily found 
large surface-defects as well as internal welding defects. Fig. (19) 
illustrates a representation of internal defects of the X-ray image 
compared with the B-scan and C-scan views of the PAUT system. This 
shows that both the NDE techniques correlate very well for large defects, 
which is expected; however, practically in industry smaller defects are 
more common. Therefore, a very small defect was analyzed, see Fig. (20). 
The defect found was measured to be in the range of 0.15 mm; however, 
fascinatingly the X-ray image does not detect the small defect. The 
associated PAUT’s B-scan and C-scan images produce the defect which is 
located in two portions of the weld.

CONCLUSION 
 
The objective of this study was to increase understanding of the post-weld 
NDE techniques that are currently used in industry, especially in the 
aerospace industry which heavily relies on welding. For further 
verification, NDE results were compared with microscopic analysis. 
X-ray radiography requires detailed knowledge to interpret correctly; 
although, in a sense, is more straightforward due to the permanent image 
that is created. PAUT post-weld inspection is complex and requires 
significant time and understanding in order to be applied effectively. It 
has been shown that the PAUT technique is an excellent choice for this 
undertaking and also the more reliable of the two techniques. It was found 
that the essential methods to conduct PAUT include setup and calibration. 
The calibration process requires that sensitivity, velocity, and wedge delay 

Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)                       Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  387 
values must be accurately determined to precisely display defect sizes and 
locations. The importance of A-scan amplitude, index offset, gain value, 
TCG calibration, PAUT imaging, and defect sizing were discussed. It was 
observed that in order not to overlook small defects a higher frequency 
phased array probe is required. Depending on the application, the PAUT 
system may need to be calibrated to find small defects with a satisfactory 
color drop.

INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced 
control systems and electronics have been developed to improve their 
performance and reliability for civil applications. Among different 
UAVs that include an extensive range of aircrafts, from small 
hand-launched 
to 
strategic 
high-tech 
ones, Remotely Piloted 
Helicopters (RPHs) with the capability of performing different flight 
modes and maneuvers such as hovering and backward flight in a small 
radius of turn have drawing more interest on the market. To name a 
few, traffic monitoring [2], communication relays [3], forest fire 
surveillance [4], sports reporting [5], and delivering goods [6] are 
among civil applications of RPHs. In recent years, there is a strong 
support of implementing renewable energies across the world [7, 8]. 
Employing UAVs in civil applications would help the global motion for 
CO2 emission reductions. 
 
Besides all advantages of RPHs for civil applications, their dynamics 
complexities, complicated aerodynamics, and structural challenges 
require precise studying to develop reliable and robust models. The 
statistical information achieved from an earlier study on distribution of 
operational RPHs all around the world, showed the worldwide interest 
in developing these UAVs [1]; USA is the pioneer among more than 20 
active countries in developing this technology. Monitoring roadway 
networks with large distances require either a large fixed infrastructure 
or large amount of labor. Also, intelligent transportation system 
technologies require quick and real-time aerial monitoring for 
highway/city traffic information and management, and roads surface 
condition monitoring (in mountain regions) [9, 10]. In this chapter, a 
novel procedure for developing an RPH is proposed in four major 
phases: 
 

Development of a Remotely Piloted Helicopter              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  397 
 
1. Conceptual design 
2. Detailed design 
3. Manufacturing and assembly 
4. Tests and reliability analysis. 
 
Each phase is studied in details through applying this procedure on an 
RPH case study, called Parvan, with a specific application in traffic 
monitoring. It should be noted that the emphasis here is on providing a 
designing procedure of the development of an RPH. Hence, further 
studies on different aspects of an RPH with the traffic monitoring 
mission such as flight stability, camera selection, data transmission, and 
high quality surveillance are required. 
 
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
 
The main goal in the conceptual design phase is to specify the desired 
application of the RPH and determine the proper range of weights, 
dimensions, and stability and performance characteristics at different 
flight modes including hover, climb, and forward flights. There are 
different methods to obtain these characteristics. Two different methods 
can be implemented: 1) deriving theoretical equations based on 
aerodynamic and dynamic principles of helicopter performance, such as 
blade element theory and momentum theory [11-14], and 2) deriving 
empirical equations based on similar helicopters characteristics. Here, we 
employ a combination of both methods to obtain the desired RPH 
characteristics for the defined mission. A strong database that includes 
dimensions and performance characteristics of similar operational 
unmanned helicopters is needed. Table 1 summarizes the studied parameters 
of more than 100 RPHs all around the world. These RPHs are classified in 
four major groups of power unit, weight, performance, and dimension [1]. In 
order to have a complete database the performance characteristics of the 

398  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
studied unmanned helicopters at sea level (SL) are also used.

A five-step procedure using the mentioned two methods would be 
employed to obtain initial estimations of the desired RPH characteristics 
(Parvan in this study): weight sizing, configuration selection, rotor 
sizing, aerodynamic sizing, and power sizing. 
 
2.1. Weight Sizing 
 
Using the obtained trends [1], one can estimate the empty weight (WEmpty), 
payload weight (WPayload ), fuel weight (WFuel ), and overall weight (WOverall) 
of an RPH for a desired mission. Mission requirements affect the RPH 
performance (altitude, range, endurance, and climate), design, 
monitoring requirements (real time or post flight, bandwidth for real 

Development of a Remotely Piloted Helicopter              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  399 
flight), and subsystems characteristics. The configuration of the RPH is 
affected by the type of the payload (imaged based surveillance, 
environmental 
sampling, 
payload 
delivery, 
communi-cations, 
serviceability, and so on). Table 2 summarizes the average performance 
characteristics (takeoff weight (WTO), operation altitude (HOperation), 
operation speed (VOperation), rate of climb (ROC), and service ceiling 
altitude (HService) of studied RPHs for four missions and the desired values 
for Parvan.

2.2. Configuration Selection 
 
In order to get the insight on the configuration design a rough sketch of 
the RPH configuration should be drawn for the specific selected 
mission. The designer has the option to follow a regular design such as 
conventional main and tail rotor, coaxial rotor [15, 16], NOTAR (no 
tail rotor) [17], and tandem rotor [18], or comes up with a new 
innovative design. Design and manufacturing complexities, cost, 

400  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
mission requirements, and aesthetic aspects of the design should be 
considered for the final configuration [1]. Fig. (1) illustrates the final 
configuration of Parvan for the defined mission of traffic monitoring. A 
conventional main and tail rotor design, a camera system as its 
payload, a fuel tank, and other parts as will be described in the following 
are modeled in CATIA to obtain this configuration at this phase. 
 
Fig. (1). The final Parvan configuration after conceptual design. 
 
2.3. Rotor Sizing 
 
The next step is to characterize the main and tail rotor geometric 
dimensions. Interpolating in the trends of different RPH design geometric 
characteristics in the created database can be performed through defining 
a set of dimensionless parameters [1]. One of the well-used 
non-dimensional parameters is the solidity factor σ, the ratio of blades 
area to rotor area which has a significant role in rotor sizing. Using σ 
helps the designer to interpolate between three main design parameters: 
number of blades b, blade chord c, and rotor radius R. The interpolation 
of c and R with two blades for the Parvan gave the initial σ value of 
0.081, the blade chord of 0.093 m and the blade radius of 0.73 m. 
Besides defining dimensionless parameters that reduce the number of 
design variables and simplify the interpolation of geometric 
characteristics, there are certain relationships between some design 
parameters. Fig. (2) illustrates the relationship between main and tail 
rotor diameters and Fig. (3) illustrates the relationship between RPH 
body height and main rotor diameter using the database [1]. These 
 
 
 

Development of a Remotely Piloted Helicopter              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  401 
relationships were used to design Parvan. Finally, initial guess on other 
geometric characteristics such as the overall length and tail rotor length 
can be made based on the empirical trends obtained from the database. 
Table 3 summarizes the Parvan components dimensions.

2.4. Aerodynamic Sizing 
 
The blade element theory together with the created database are the 
basis for aerodynamic sizing, thrust sizing, and rotational speed (in 
RPM) selection. Due to the importance of this step, three different 
methods are performed and compared to each other to obtain the final 
values: 
 
1. Using the database to estimate the required power, select the RPM, 
and obtain the lift/drag coefficients based on the required thrust; 
2. Using the database to estimate the lift/drag coefficients and RPM 
through the power and thrust relations; 
3. Using conventional airfoil databases to select an airfoil, determine 
the thrust, required power, and RPM. 
 
2.5. Power Sizing 
 
All the generated and lost powers should be calculated in order to estimate 
the required power and choosing the right engine type. Through the Parvan 
project, it was found out that the most important parts of the power 
contributions are the induced power (Pi) and the profile power (Po) which 
are defined by [13]:

where Cpi is the induced power coefficient, ρ is the air density, A is the rotor 
area, R is the rotor radius, ω is the rotor blade angular velocity (in RPM), κ 
is an empirical factor equal to 1.15, CT is the thrust coefficient, and CD is the 
drag coefficient. The total power at different altitudes, rate of climbs, 
speeds, and different flight modes including hover, climb, and forward 
flights should be calculated [1]. Different software packages or self-coding 
can be employed for performance analysis and calculating performance 
parameters such as maximum sustainable speed, maximum ROC, hover 
ceiling, service ceiling, and power matching. These parameters were 
calculated through a novel coding developed by the Parvan group. The 
changes in the main rotor power, total power, and the maximum ROC at 
different forward speeds have been shown in an earlier study [1]. It was 
seen that at a specific altitude, the main rotor power decreases with 
increasing the forward speed.  Also, at a specific altitude, the total power 
(the summation of induced power, profile power, parasite power, and main 
rotor power) has its minimum for maximum forward speed in the range of 
32-72 km/hr and it increases as the maximum forward speed increase.  
Finally, the maximum ROC decreases with altitude. 
 
DETAILED DESIGN 
 
Upon completion the estimations made on initial design parameters 
through conceptual design phase, further refinements on design 
parameters should be performed to obtain the final RPH design. Hence, 
final component design characteristics for Parvan were determined, 
detailed component sketches got prepared, and the material selection 

404  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
and manufacturing steps were performed accordingly. Before final 
manufacturing and assembling phase, different subsystem components 
were assembled and tested separately. A brief review on the studied 
subsystems such as engine and fuel system, blade selection, power 
transmitting system, control command system, and modeling of the 
developed RPH is provided here. 
 
3.1. Engine and Fuel System  
The power plant unit, the heart of small-scale aircraft, requires certain 
considerations in different design phases. Selecting the best engine in 
the design process asks for the compatibility with the required 
performance for hovering and forward flights that needs to consider the 
advantages and disadvantages of each type of the available options. Four 
common types of engines used in UAVs and especially RPHs are: 1) 
electrical engines, 2) small-scale turbofan engines, 3) gas engines, and 4) 
turbine engines [19]. The engine of such small aircrafts is selected to be 
sufficiently efficient in terms of the weight and the available power. 
However, although a piston engine is less efficient in the start-up 
process and more costly than electric engines, two important 
characteristics made it an appropriate choice for Parvan for the 
predefined mission: higher power to weight ratio and higher endurance 
[20]. Note that jet engines are used in larger classes and they are much 
heavier than the conventional piston ones [20]. There is not a solid 
decision on the best engine choice; the defined mission and the RPH 
class would determine the most appropriate choice. 
 
The very first choice for an RPH would be an electric engine. These 
engines are the most convenient ones to setup and obtain a moderate 
power to weight ratio compared to internal combustion engines [19]. 
The process of tuning carburetors, fuel systems and exhaust does not 
need to be tuned. They are more efficient than piston engines and they 

Development of a Remotely Piloted Helicopter              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  405 
are less likely to crash during the flight as a result of the fuel/air mixture 
or ignition problems. However, these engines are not economically as 
efficient as nitro-gas powered engines due to the price of large-capacity 
lithium batteries. The batteries are not durable in the severe maneuvers 
due to the power required for these regimes. An advantage of these 
types of engines would be the quick start up compared to other engine 
types such as the gas powered engines and turbine powered engines. 
One of the most profitable factors of using electric engines would be the 
constant center of gravity during the flight compared to the other types 
which use the chemical fuels. Moreover, the noise created from these 
engines would be quite negligible and their operation at high frequencies 
results in low vibration levels. On the other side, to name a few of 
their main disadvantages: 1) the flight time can be short, 2) the cooling 
time for the batteries between flights would be essential, and 3) large 
lithium batteries can be dangerous and easily ruined if not cared 
properly. 
 
Model engines utilize glow-ignition combustion, rather than spark 
ignition or fuel injection. Fuel and air are premixed and an incandescent 
platinum wire is used to catalyze the combustion. Combustion analysis 
was carried out to investigate the combustion process [21]. 
Nevertheless, the nitro powered RC-engines are more advantageous in 
terms of the time required for charging the batteries or cooling down the 
system of speed controllers is rather high for electric engines. 
RC-engines can easily operate by just refueling the aircraft after each 
flight mission [19]. These engines are cheaper than electric powered 
engines. However, these engines are very noisy with many vibrations. 
As it was mentioned before, the vibration is a common problem in 
many piston engines; hence, there are many researches dealing with the 
noise reduction in such engines since helicopters are almost huge 
vibrating systems due to their main rotors [22]. Also, as it is proposed by 
Whitelaw [23] the internal combustion engines like what is used in 

406  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
Parvan has less efficient combustion process compared to other types of 
engines such as electric ones. These types of engines are not 
environmentally friendly due to the emission of nitro-based fuel. 
Moreover, the change of center of gravity of the power system due the 
fuel consumption requires a real-time or predictive estimation about the 
fuel consumption in these engines. These engines are difficult and tricky 
in appropriate tuning and setup since the air to fuel ratio is not 
programmed and is controlled through the throttle position directly. 
 
Gas engines are very powerful and run at lower RPMs. Their operational 
procedure is easier than the nitro engines, whilst they provide higher 
flight endurance, and are less expensive [24]. The main disadvantages of 
such  engines are: 1) lower power to  weight ratio, 2) higher price 
than electric engines, and 3) high voltage igniters which requires a 
powerful battery [19]. 
 
Turbine engines are one of the most reliable ones to be used in the 
unmanned helicopters. There is no requirement for tuning the system 
manually since they are controlled using their built-in computers. These 
engines are very noisy and are the heaviest type of helicopter engines. 
Moreover, they are more expensive than the electric ones and possess a 
higher operating cost and maintenance than any other type. However, the 
startup and stop processes of turbine engines are much easier than the 
other types. Although these engines are powerful, the power to weight 
ratio is not as efficient as other types such as electric ones. 
 
Considering different types of engines, a piston engine was selected for 
Parvan [1]. The selected OS-91 SZH engine with a nominal power of 3.3 
hp [25] which is 2460.8 Watt was compatible with the flight mission 
and performance requirements. However, as it is illustrated in Fig. (4) 
the shaft power required for hovering condition is almost less than half 
of the engine nominal power and the power measured in the detailed 
design process is sufficient for such a flight.

the experimental data obtained from P = 4.47Ω3 − 1.3Ω2 + 1.28Ω − 4.15, and (b) estimated torque 
using the same data form and the torque equation of Q = 6.81Ω3 − 1.96Ω2 + 1.89Ω − 5.98. 
 
Since the defined mission for Parvan, requires a high endurance in hovering 
regime, as opposed to other modes of flight, the design team decided to 
choose the main rotor rpm according to the thrust required for hovering 
flight. Nevertheless, this number might be changed for different flight 
missions. Hence, the gear ratio should be selected to maintain the hovering 
flight (based on the defined mission), while other flight regimes are 
considered as well. The best way to choose the optimal gear ratio is based 
on measuring different torque and angular velocity of the engine while it is 
running the power transmission system, main rotor, and tail rotor. A thrust 
test stand can be designed and manufactured to measure the main rotor 
thrust and power to find the gear ratio. Due to the complexities of using the 
OS-91 SZH engine on the test stand, an electric engine was used in place of 
the piston engine with a higher gear ratio than the one used on Parvan 
(Parvan’s power transmitting system is explained in section 3.3). The gear 
train was designed to rotate the main rotor with an angular velocity of 1500 
rpm. Fig. (5) illustrates the required power and thrust of main rotor which 
are obtained experimentally.

The required thrust for stabilizing the RPH in hovering flight can be 
calculated using the existing models [1], hence, a total collective pitch is 
picked for neutralizing the weight; and the power associated with the 
pitching angle gives us the required rpm for the main rotor. This angular 
velocity is found to be 1500 rpm which gives an optimum power for the 
Parvan engine based on the power equation shown in Fig. (4). Hence, the 
total gear ratio is determined through the aforementioned procedure. 
 
3.2. Blade Selection 
In order to meet the performance goals such as the maximum ROC and 
the required flight ceiling at different flight modes, the blade chord and 
length were determined based on the available power and the required 
main rotor power. As the next step, parameters including the required 
thrust, rotor RPM, and solidity factor should also be considered. Hence, 
a database of blades’ thrust at different chord and length values, but 
similar pitch angle for a required power was obtained. A blade with

optimum characteristics is determined by performing this analysis [1]. It 
should be noted that the aim of this step was blade selection and in case of 
fabricating a new composite blade, a bi-level design optimization approach 
can be used to determine the stacking sequence while the overall weight is 
the objective function. 
 
3.3. Power Transmitting System 
 
The schematic of the power transmission system in a helicopter design 
procedure is illustrated in Fig. (6). Upon determining the mission and 
weight class of an RPH, choosing the main and tail rotor configuration, and 
obtaining the mission torque and power requirements, one may proceed 
with designing the gearbox. A gearbox system transfers the engine power 
from the main shaft to the main and tail rotors. Using different gear ratios, 
different rotational speeds and torques can be obtained. The engine RPM 
is higher than the main and tail rotor rotational speeds, and the tail RPM is 
higher than the main rotor RPM. Considering all these limitations, the 
gearbox system is designed to obtain optimum rotational speeds and 
torques. An appropriate transmission system design would help to reduce 
the structural loads and prevent failures because of the maximum RPM at 
the main rotor. Given the properties and dimensions of the Parvan engine 
and blades, keeping the main rotor rotational speed in a range of 6 to 9 
times slower than the engine RPM would result in keeping tip Mach 
number of blades less than one which is desirable to avoid loud rotor and 
heavy structures. On the other hand, higher rotor speeds in the range of 3 
to 6 times faster than the main rotor rotational speeds are desirable for the 
tail rotor with smaller rotor diameter. 
 
Small engines can drive a broad range of desired rotors by adjusting the 
optimal RPM of rotors through a proper transmission design. Indeed, a 
high-speed low-torque engine output can be transferred to low-speed 

410  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
high-torque values via gearbox in order to drive a large and heavy main 
rotor. The best engine performance, main, and tail rotors are achieved at 
certain rotational speeds. While obtaining this optimal rotational speed is 
achieved through a proper gearbox design, a careless design of torque and 
RPM setting might result in serious engine damages. 
 
 
Fig. (6). The schematic of the transmission system design in overall helicopter design process. 
 
The optimal performance of the transmitting system is achieved mainly 
by choosing the best gear ratio for each component. For main rotor, gear 
ratio is the ratio of the main rotor gear speed over engine gear speed 
which is usually in the range of 6 to 9. This ratio was obtained by 
calculating the ratio of number of teeth on main gear over engine gear, 
or equally by ratio of the main gear torque to the engine gear torque. It 
means that reducing the speed on the main rotor can be achieved by 
choosing different number of teeth on main and engine gears. For 
example, for a gear ratio of 10, one can reduce the 15000 RPM at 3.3 hp 
from a typical small engine, to 1500 RPM at the main rotor.

The next step in this transmission system design is choosing tail to main 
rotor gear ratio which is normally in the range of 3 to 6. This ratio is 
defined as the ratio of the tail rotor RPM over main rotor RPM. The 
other aspect of transmission system design is choosing a mechanism for 
delivering the power at the tail rotor. In conventional small helicopters 
this is done via a shaft or strap passing through tail boom. This can also 
be done through belts and pulleys which is the case in Parvan. Other 
important parameters in transmission system design are gear mesh and 
gear module (or gear mod). Gear mesh is the representative of the free 
tolerance between two gears. In the case of tight gears, friction 
increases and causes overheat and vibration with increased power loss in 
the system. On the other hand, using loose gears results in gear stripping. 
Hence, an optimal gear mesh should be selected in order to achieve a 
good performance in transmission system. Gear module (mod) represents 
the width of teeth in millimeters for each gear; the thicker the gear teeth, 
the higher the mod number.

Here, pitch circle as shown in Fig. (7) is described as the circle of one gear 
that is tangent to the other gear’s pitch circle. In order to choose this 
parameter correctly, the effect of gear ratio on gear mesh in a specific range 
of gear diameters as well as the amount of power to be transmitted should 
be taken into account. Having higher gear mod results in handling more 
power and fewer teeth engagement for the same gear ratio. On the other 
hand, low gear mod will result in lower power handling capability, but good 
teeth engagements.

After gear ratio selection for gearbox that is done by analyzing the main and 
tail rotors and engine thrust and power values, in order to prove the 
adequacy of frequency separation between natural frequency of the power 
transmitting system and the rotor RPM for a safe flight, vibration behavior 
of the transmission system were studied. Holzer method [27] is used for 
calculating the natural frequencies of the power system. According to Fig. 
(6), if frequency separation to avoid coupling with the operating modes of 
the vehicle is not enough, then gear box should be redesigned in order to 
meet the requirements. 
 
As the final note on transmission system design, a centrifugal clutch is 
designed in order to prevent the rotation of the blades in starting and warm 
up phases. Geometry design and material selection for gears and clutch are 
done considering the engine idle RPM and maximum transmitted torque. 
 
STABILITY AND CONTROL OF A REMOTELY PILOTED 
HELICOPTER 
 
Stability and control of an aircraft is an inevitable part of a flight; the 
safe and appropriate flight modes would not be achieved without an 
accurate determination of stability and control of the system. In the 

Development of a Remotely Piloted Helicopter              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  413 
design stages of an aircraft, investigating the performance limits is 
required for stability analysis. For manned aircrafts, flight simulation 
before the test is a usual process that saves time and costs in the design 
and manufacturing phases, and helps avoiding the contingent human 
errors during the flight which saves the life of the pilot and prevents 
unavoidable accidents. 
 
Advanced control systems with small sizes that are able to 
communicate through wireless systems have an emerging progress in 
the recent years. UAVs such as remotely piloted helicopters are one 
those advanced systems that have an inherent dynamic complexity, and 
critical stability that needs to be considered to maintain a controlled 
state in the vehicle. Hence, it is required to have a stable vehicle with 
a designed control system to avoid any possible deviation from the 
prescribed mission of an aircraft during the flight path. A model of the 
vehicle describing the aerodynamics and dynamics of the system is 
required to design the controllers. According to the seventy years of 
experience in the field of helicopters, different studies are made to 
optimize these vehicles and find newer applications such as unmanned 
helicopters [1]. 
UAVs have been used extensively during the past decades. New 
innovations, improvements, and modifications are made to these types 
of aircrafts every year. The flight simulation of an aircraft contributes 
the designers to build the mathematical model of the aircraft in order to 
test the performance of controlling and navigating devices such as a 
controller or an autopilot. The autopilot guides a real aircraft, hence the 
mathematical model used for the autopilot must be as accurate as 
possible to maintain the sophisticated dynamics of the vehicle 
sufficiently. This will arise the importance of the accurately modeling of 
the aerodynamics and the dynamics of the aircraft.

4.1. Dynamic Modeling 
 
Helicopter is a complex system with inherent instabilities. Nonlinear 
aerodynamic forces and moments, as well as the gravity exerted on the 
flexible parts of the system such as blades, require adding the flapping 
characteristics of the rotor to the dynamic equations of the model which 
is described in the following sections. 
 
4.1.1. Methodology 
 
In this section, an appropriate level of stability of an aircraft, which 
contributes a pilot to accomplish the mission, is defined briefly. The 
essence of this part of the design process will be beneficial if the 
control of an unstable UAV can be improved in the earlier stages of 
design before the prototypes being made. Hence, the stability of an 
aerial vehicle is one of the most significant and challenging factors that 
needs serious attention during its design or optimization. The 
determination of the stability characteristics of helicopters is of 
importance in two different branches: during the design process, before 
manufacturing, and for modifying the stability characteristics of a 
manufactured helicopter by designing controllers to match its behavior 
with the new defined mission. Indeed, design parameters directly affect 
the stability characteristics. Hence, in the first phases of design, the 
stability can be improved by some adjustments in those parameters. 
These improvements also reduce the complexity of designing controllers 
in order to make the aircraft operational. Basically, there are two 
techniques to have a desirable stability characteristic: active or passive 
techniques. In the active mode, a controller works as a stabilizer and 
adds an artificial stability to the aircraft. In the passive one, the aircraft 
has been designed to be naturally stable; hence, there would be no need 

Development of a Remotely Piloted Helicopter              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  415 
to be artificially stabilized. For both modes, an appropriate analysis of 
stability characteristics of the system is required, so improvement of 
these characteristics as much as possible is necessitated. In fact, this job 
is usually done by implementing trial and error methods that would not 
only be a time consuming process but also the designer cannot find out 
which parameter is more effective in a special stability mode and has to 
be changed. 
 
A linear mathematical model of an RPH with stabilizer bar is introduced 
based on the stability derivatives of these special types of aircrafts. 
Although deriving these derivatives for helicopters by theoretical 
techniques is not easy, it is an advantageous method in comparison to the 
other ones; the influence of all design parameters on the stability 
characteristics of the entire system can be directly seen. First, some 
simple analytical models of the rotor, fuselage and other components of 
the helicopter are built. Then, by combining these models and 
linearizing them, the derivatives can be evaluated by analytical methods 
in dynamics and aerodynamics of conventional helicopters. Moreover, 
the dynamics of a stabilizer bar including its flapping characteristics is 
generally described in order to include its behavior in the entire dynamics 
of the aircraft. In the next step the trim condition of the aircraft is 
calculated by iteration based on a simplified set of equations in hover 
and forward flight. Then, after building the state-space equation, it is 
solved based on the states estimated in trim condition. After simulation, 
the time history of each state under distinct situations such as existence 
of a stabilizer-bar or without it and with an external excitement or 
individually investigated. As it is mentioned, the mathematical model 
describing the stability of a helicopter is dependent on the performance 
characteristics. 
 
The helicopter motion, aerodynamics and flight mechanics are highly 
influenced by the main rotor. The model of the helicopter asks for 

416  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
certain requirements for the helicopter performance and then, those 
requirements may help to define the behavior of the vehicle. Such a 
model can be used for simulations. For instance, the forward flight of the 
helicopter is the same as hovering flight, but in larger forward speeds the 
parasite drag force has a critical role in the motion of the helicopter. 
Hence, a wind tunnel testing will answer the questions about the 
accurate identification of the drag force. However, if the wind tunnel is 
not available, the analytical model of the aircraft with smaller forward 
speed is sufficiently valid for the purpose of deriving the equations of 
motion, forces, and accelerations.

In the present work, the dynamic model of the helicopter is separated 
based on the most significant flight regimes in conjunction with the 
importance of the regimes according to the mission. These flight 
regimes are the forward flight, climb, and hover as it is mentioned in 
Fig. (8). In each flight regime, the performance and the trim conditions 
of the aircraft should be studied based on the performance in the 
forward, climb, and hovering flights. The control of the helicopter is 
different in each flight regime.

An active control device which most of the small-scale RPH take 
advantage of is control rotor (flybar) which is a small rotor located on 
the top of the main frame and below the main rotor. In Fig. (9), the 
control rotor is illustrated which is a small rotor with two blades. These 
blades are acting as control surfaces providing an analog type of control 
that is associated with the flapping motion of the small rotor from which 
the cyclic pitch on the main rotor is produced.

As shown in Fig. (10), the Bell-Hiller mechanism is used to dampen the 
control inputs to the main rotor. This mechanism is a gain to the main 
rotor cyclic pitching system through which the dynamic feedback on roll 
and pitch rates is damped. In the proposed study, the control rotor has 
only a stabilizing character and is not applied to increase handling 
qualities.

4.1.2. Rigid Body Equations of Motion 
 
Newton’s second law is the key to study the physics of the helicopter 
motion. Assuming that the reference frame is the stationary earth, one 
can develop the kinetics and kinematics of the rigid body motion to be

forces and moments denoted as F and M, respectively, are acting on the 
system. Expanding forces and moments as well as the acceleration and 
inertial terms on the right hand side of Eq. 8 facilitates the linearization 
and making the aerodynamic and stability derivatives.

where X, Y, and Z are corresponding to the forces in the x, y, and z axes, 
respectively, whereas, the pitching, rolling and yawing moments are 
denoted by M, R, and N, respectively. The variable h defines the height 
from body axis to the point that the force is exerted and so forth for l. 
Those variables described by the index F are in association with 
fuselage, while H refers to the horizontal stabilizer mounted on the 
helicopter tail, and V refers to the vertical stabilizer. 
 
The six degrees of freedom (DOF) of a rigid body is a simple way to 
start describing the behavior of a system with higher complexities. 
These are the minimum complexity equations summarizing a dynamic 
model of the helicopter including the translational velocities known as 
u, v, and w; the other three rotational DOFs excluding the flapping 
dynamics of the control rotor and the directional degrees of freedom 
respect to the earth axis such as Euler angles are p, q, and r. Considering 
this model, the equations of motion are evaluated based on the 
contribution of each component of the system in the following format: 

420  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
Studying the cyclic motion of the main rotor disk due to the aerodynamic 
forces and moments associated with the gyroscopic behavior of the rotor 
which is also affected by the type of control input whether to be 
longitudinal or lateral. Hence, the lateral and longitudinal cyclic pitch 
of the main rotor is dependent to the flapping dynamics of the control 
rotor in the systems that are working with this analogue controller to 
dampen the pilot’s control inputs for two cyclic angles in lateral and 
longitudinal directions. These two angles create two more degrees of 
freedom for the rigid body of the helicopter, which will be added to the 
two more degrees of freedom for the body frame rotations respect to the 
earth reference frame. The latter 2-DOFs are created based on the 
pitching and rolling Euler angles. Hence, the dynamical system has 
10-DOF which is investigated in this study. 
 
4.2. Trim and Stability Analysis 
 
4.2.1. Analysis of the Trim 
 
The linear dynamic modeling of an aircraft is complete when the trim 
and stability analysis have significant progress. The trim is a condition 
when all of the accelerations are removed from the system and the 
equations are solved based on some initial conditions. The solution to the 
trim condition then is used as an input to the linearized dynamic model 
where small perturbations assumption is valid. The linearization is a 
process in which: (1) all the components on the left hand side of Eq. 8 is 
summarized in one term and the small angle assumption is applied to the 
right hand side, (2) then the contribution of each component on the left 
hand side (LHS) is considered using the first derivative of the forces or 
moments on LHS respect to the component itself, and this derivative 
which is called stability derivative is multiplied by the degrees of the 
freedom in the system and the four control inputs. The form of the LHS 
in the equations of motion will be:

where, βc,CR and βs,CR are the longitudinal and lateral flapping angles for 
the stabilizer bar, respectively. According to the Eq. 9, there are 
nonlinear terms on the right hand side which can be linearized using the 
Taylor expansion over the trim point of the system. The requirement to 
use the Taylor expansion in linearizing the equations is based upon the 
assumption of analytic functions of aerodynamic forces and moments to 
be valid over the trim point [11]. Having spikes without smoothness in 
the functions with discontinuities breaks this assumption. 
 
4.2.2. Stability 
 
The main problem in analyzing the dynamics of flight and the system 
response to the control inputs are the number of degrees of freedom in 
the model. The best way to analyze the nonlinear systems linearly is to 
divide the longitudinal and lateral modes of flight with the certain 
assumption suggesting the small coupling between these modes as it has 
been asserted for Parvan in [31]. According to this study, the stability 
and aerodynamic derivatives for the case study (Parvan) delineating the 
coupling between the longitudinal and lateral modes, as well as roll and 
yaw axes [11] are sufficiently negligible compared to the pure 
derivatives in each aforementioned mode. Hence, the process of 
isolating these modes in the analysis may have only a weak drawback in 
maneuvering phases in which the coupled dynamic forces play key role 
in the analysis system; a case where the small perturbation assumption is 
no longer valid and the system cannot be modeled linearly. The 10-DOF 
flight model studied in [31] was tested by the linear method of analyzing

stability proposed by Prouty and Padfield in [11, 29]. In this section, the 
stability is studied in hover and forward flight. 
 
4.2.2.1. Stability Analysis in Hovering Flight 
 
Hover is a major part of the flight envelopes in most of the defined 
missions for helicopters. The characteristic equation of the 10-DOF 
system of Parvan in hovering flight is shown in Eq. 10:

The stability in the lateral or longitudinal modes are not determined 
unless the modes are studied separately to presume which mode or root 
is more coupled with the other mode. The longitudinal characteristics of 
the 5-DOF which is explained in Table 4, the system has an almost 
neutral state with a period of 23.7 seconds and a large divergence time to 
reach the double amplitude at 217 seconds, while the stable oscillations 
are short period that are damped very fast in 0.35 seconds. Hence, the 
longitudinal mode in hover is showing a stable character which is 
uncoupled from the lateral mode with a very good accuracy. The first 
root in Table 4 is emanated from the vertical forces and moments in the 
hovering flight. As it is shown in [31], the aerodynamic and stability 
derivatives in vertical direction are almost negligible in hovering flight. 

Development of a Remotely Piloted Helicopter              Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  423 
Hence, by removing the corresponding equation from the analysis, the 
roots are just slightly changed which proves the assumption of 
uncoupled dynamics in vertical direction in hover with other degrees of 
freedom. Hence, the response to the 5-DOF and 4-DOF are almost 
similar to an input. Also, it is possible to simplify the system to a 
3-DOF (as it is been demonstrated in Fig. (11) or 2-DOF one using the 
assumption that the forces acting in the forward direction X are 
negligible since there is no forward speed or the speed is controlled to be 
very small and stable. Therefore, the only oscillation that has a period of 
23 seconds is due to the pitching moment and flybar flapping. The 
oscillations are neutrally stable, therefore, the longitudinal mode of 
Parvan in hover is stable. 
 
As it was mentioned in this section, the helicopter is slightly unstable in 
the lateral modes. It is essential to mention that the rolling inertia is 
much less than the pitching inertia in the proposed design of Parvan, so 
the magnitude of the stability derivatives are larger than the pitching 
derivatives. Hence, the sensitivity of the system response is larger to 
instability in this direction since the period of lateral motions has shorter 
periods and lower damping ratios compared to longitudinal ones. The 
characteristic equation of the 5-DOF system is shown in Eq. 12:

Forward flight is another important part of the flight envelopes in most 
of the defined missions for helicopters. The characteristic equation of

By using the same approach that is indicated in hovering flight, one is 
able to distinguish the coupled and uncoupled roots and the couplings 
between the modes in forward flight, consequently. The longitudinal 
roots of this mode are evaluated by expanding the longitudinal

There are two oscillations in the longitudinal mode of forward flight; 
stable and neutrally unstable. It is possible to stabilize the oscillations by 
improving the longitudinal control surfaces such as horizontal stabilizer. 
The step response of the 5-DOF system in forward flight to 1 degree of 
cyclic pitch B1 is depicted in Fig. (12). The response of the 5-DOF 

426  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
system to the cyclic pitch consists of two modes of Phugoid and short 
period. According to this, one degree in cyclic pitch will cause 
approximately 10 degrees of response which is damped after 
approximately 5 seconds. 
 
Fig. (12). The step response of the 5-DOF simplified longitudinal mode in forward flight to 
cyclic pitch of B1 [31]. 
The dynamics of the helicopter in lateral flight is based on the lateral 
wind, yawing rate, rolling rate, lateral flapping of control rotor, and the 
rolling angle. Basically, the lateral dynamics of helicopters is not quite 
stable inherently and is controlled with the thrust of the main rotor and 
tail rotor to compensate for the discrepancies between their available 
torques in the case of the lateral instability such as a lateral wind. One of 
the main contributions of the instabilities is emanated from the tail rotor 
thrust. The increase in forward speed results in more instabilities since 
the torque of main rotor is increased. The dynamics of pure lateral 
motion in forward flight is described using Eq. 18.

As it is shown in Eq. 18, Parvan is unstable in lateral flight mode due to 
the large positive root. This is something that was expected before the 
analysis but it is possible to improve the instabilities using controllers for 
this design or by optimizing the design. 
 
Fig. (13). The 3-D schematic of Parvan in CATIA. 
CATIA MODELING 
There is a transition phase from the conceptual to detailed design, we 
called it the “preliminary design”, where the overall configuration of the 
helicopter is specified according to the main subsystems. Computer- 
aided design (CAD) software would be the best option to create this 
preliminary design and also for the following modification, analysis, or 
optimization studies. One of the most suitable CAD software packages is 
CATIA that has lots of powerful modules (Part Design, Product Design, 
DMU Kinematics, Generative Shape Design and Drafting and so on) for 
designing mechanical parts and products together with defining the 
physical properties of different parts. Fig. (13) illustrates the 3-D 

428  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Goudarzi et al. 
schematic of Parvan in CATIA. The output results from the preliminary 
design such as the overall allowed and estimated weight and parts 
dimensions were used in the detailed design phase for the final 
subsystem designs. Further modifications and studies of different 
subsystems were also carried out in CATIA - Final designs of 
subsystems were converted to an appropriate format for manufacturing. 
 
MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLING 
 
The final technical drawings from the detailed design phase should be 
sent for manufacturing. Before considering the required accuracy, 
precision, and optimum machining techniques, the best material should 
be selected. It should meet the design and mission requirements, and it 
meets an optimum value from a trade-off between cost, weight, life 
cycle and reliability considerations. The product tree is found the best 
tool to show relations of components and subsystems. Concerning a 
complex system like a helicopter, for providing a detailed product tree, 
Parvan was divided into eight distinct groups from the assembly 
viewpoint including engine, fly-bar, hub, power train, tail, and avionics. 
Therefore, each group was assembled separately to montage the whole 
system. For instance, Fig. (14) illustrates the product tree of the engine 
group with its subsystems. It is important to make an accurate 
documentation at this step in order to assure the procedure of 
assembling and disassembling is followed correctly each time.

An extensive research is required to obtain appropriate materials and 
manufacturing techniques. In the developed RPH, aluminum alloys are 
preferred to carbon fiber sheets for fuselage frame due to its less cost 
and manufacturing complexities. Fiber glass was selected for tail boom 
and horizontal and vertical stabilizers where certain stiffness and weight 
are considered.

The main and tail rotor hub and swashplates are made from Al 7075 and 
steel is used for the main shaft of Parvan. Al-7075 is a strong aluminum 
alloy with high strength, light weight, and less resistance to corrosion 
than many other aluminum alloys. Among different manufacturing 
techniques, CNC was selected for small and fine aluminum based 
components and wire cut technique was used for fuselage and fly-bar 
frames. Some parts such as hub Fig. (15a) and swashplate Fig. (15b) are 
manufactured for this specific design, and some others are bought from 
existing off-the-shelf market such as the OS 91SZ-H ring engine.

engine at different rotational speeds are obtained. Main/tail rotor tests 
provide the aerodynamic characteristics and performance parameters of 
the main/tail rotor. The strength of the structure is obtained by 
conducting structural and fatigue tests. Wind tunnel tests would provide 
estimations on the aero- dynamics forces around the helicopter and the 
flow interaction between different components such as the main rotor 
blades and fuselage. In this study, because of the complexities and 
limitations of the various tests, only engine torque/power tests and main 
rotor tests are performed for Parvan subsystems which are described in 
this section. 
 
As explained in the detailed design section and in Fig. (6), the engine 
torque/power rating is the input for designing the gearbox system. Fig. 
(18) shows the designed engine torque/power test-stand for the Parvan 
project. The engine torque/power values at different rotational speeds 
and various blade sizes were calculated using Eq. 20 [13, 29]:

where e is hinge offset representing the specific point on the blade 
where a positive lift force starts on the blade, R is the blade radius, α is a 
constant value ( 1/2 ρ𝑐̅𝐶̅l) at certain height (with constant density, ρ) and 
a fixed blade (with constant chord 𝑐̅ and lift coefficient 𝐶̅l), and is the 
rotational speed. Fig. (18) illustrates the output power and torque curves 
at different rotational speeds from one of the test results. 
Having the final gearbox design as shown in Fig. (19), the RPH main 
rotor thrust values at different rotational speeds and input powers are 
obtained using the designed thrust test stand shown in Fig. (20).

Reliability is the probability of desired system operation under a 
specified condition for determined time duration [32]. The ground tests 
of the subsystems and also the whole system, together with the flight 
tests are employed to estimate the mission success and failure rates of 
Parvan. Fig. (21) shows the flight of Parvan during one of the flight test.

It is helpful to review a number of fundamental concepts defined in 
reliability studies. Mean Time between Failures (MTBF) states how 
long a repairable component will execute without facing any failure 
[33]. Definite relationships are defined between the reliability and 
MTBF. For non-repairable components, Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) 
is used instead of MTBF. 
 
Fig. (22) illustrates a typical failure rate historic diagram of a 
component. After initial tests and debugging the system, the failure rate 
for a given component tends to be constant until the component 
approaches the end of its life time [28], the wear out period. The MTBF 
or failure rate is estimated with the reliability function R(t) as follows [34]:

of the failures and identifies potential product weaknesses assuming a 
pessimistic viewpoint since the design procedure usually approaches from 
an optimistic viewpoint. Table 5 shows a typical developed FMECA table 
to find the most critical failure modes and hence, the most critical group of 
the components of Parvan. In Table 5, P is the probability of the failure, PN 
is the probability number of the failure, n is the severity of the failure and d 
is the possibility of its detection. Moreover, C is the criticality of each 
component which is a multiplication of PN, n, and d. In the present study, 
these numbers are assumed to vary from 1 to 3 with respect to the 
component specifications, operation and role. One can see that the possible 
minimum and maximum values for C are 1 and 27, respectively. The norm 
of the criticality is considered to be 12 which sets the maximum acceptable 
criticality for any component. The components with critical numbers larger 
than the norm have been revised and redesigned to meet this norm and 
ensure safe operation. In order to have a good estimation for the reliability 
of Parvan, detailed calculations are performed for most critical subsystems. 
The column "preventive and recovery precautions" of the FMECA table is 
used to determine some maintenance issues. These precautions include three 
actions: a) Scheduled preflight checks(including check of servos, fan casing, 
pinion, gear, main shaft, control links, structure screws, tail swash plate, etc. 
before each flight and the main shaft lock, bearings, mechanism screws, 
pulley and tail belt, etc. every 10 hours of flight), b) Replacement of 
distorted parts (including clutch strip and main shaft bearing), c) Some 
alarm gauges for undesirable conditions(including low battery and governor 
alarm, engine temperature sensor). 
 
Table 6 summarizes the criticality numbers for all the subsystems in the 
Parvan project. The control subsystem has the most average critically 
number; hence, more detailed reliability calculations are performed in [33]. 
Finally, an improved reliability of the control system is achieved through 
analyzing and modifying the control components and the fabrication 
methods.

CONCLUSION 
 
In this chapter, a practical stepwise approach in developing an RPH 
proposed and studied analytically and experimentally. The procedure 
employed on designing and manufacturing an RPH, called Parvan for a 
specific mission of traffic monitoring. The main conclusions of the 
proposed procedure can be summarized as: 1) a feasibility study of 
more than 100 RPHs provided a strong database with a vast range of 
RPH missions and performance and geometric characteristics, 2) the 
conceptual design phase provided with performance sizing, weight 
sizing, aerodynamics design, structural design, and power system for a 
defined mission through either theoretical equations or empirical results 
for similar designs, 3) the detailed design phase provided with final 
component designs for the specified mission. A 3-D Parvan design was 
developed in CATIA for full model formation, 4) the performance of 
sub-systems was tested through a series of ground tests. The final 
system was assembled and further improvements performed using the 
flight tests data, 5) reliability analysis together with tests performed to 
enhance the safety and maintainability of Parvan. Hence, component 
failures at different flight modes for the specified mission were studied 
using the FMEA/FMECA method, and a series of preventive and 
recovery precautions were performed on the design, configuration, 
assembling, and material selections, and 6) finally, the test flights 
demonstrated the success of the proposed procedure in developing a 
reliable operational RPH with a sensible cost.

Abstract: This chapter reviews the advances in the materials for applications in 
structures of both subsonicas well as supersonic aircrafts. An account of the 
operating and ambient environmental conditions during flight is first given and the 
resulting material requirements have been discussed. Design relationships have been 
established taking into consideration the loading conditions and the strength 
requirements. In particular, the aircraft skin temperatures at various mach numbers 
have been taken into account for selecting appropriate structural materials for both 
subsonic and supersonic aircrafts; and consequently various aerospace aluminum 
alloys, titanium alloys, superalloys, and composites have been suggested. Finally, a 
new materials-selection chart is presented which would help aerospace designers to 
select appropriate materials for structural application in subsonic and supersonic 
aircrafts. 
Keywords: Aluminum alloys, Composites, Materials selection, Subsonic

INTRODUCTION 
The design of an aircraft and its materials have to be determined based on 
classical engineering principles and practices because even a tiny mistake 
in the design of any critical aircraft components such as fuselage, skeleton, 

444  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Zainul Huda 
 
and wing may lead to fatality. A subsonic aircraft is an aircraft with a 
maximum speed less than the Mach 1 (speed of sound) i.e. less than 750 
mi/h (1207 km/h). On the other hand, supersonic aircrafts have the 
capacity of flying at speeds greater than Mach one, 1 < M < 4. Currently, 
supersonic aircrafts fly at speeds less than 2000 mi/h (3219 km/h). The 
important factors in selecting aircraft materials include specific strength 
(strength-to-weight ratio), tensile mechanical properties, fatigue strength, 
low-speed impact strength, fracture toughness, notch sensitivity, 
manufacturability, resistances to crack propagation, stress corrosion, and 
exfoliation corrosion [1-3]. Extra material criterion, exclusively related to 
the design of supersonic aircraft, is the resistance to creep. This is because 
the long-term operation at Mach 3.5 may lead to heat buildup within the 
structure of the aircraft to a temperature around 300 oC [4, 5]. 
 
Having established the material requirements for application in structures 
of subsonic and supersonic aircrafts in the preceding paragraph, it is 
appropriate to discuss the performance the aerospace structural materials; 
the latter include aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, and composites. This 
paragraph deals with aerospace alloys for subsonic aircrafts. A high-priority 
material research focus in today’s civil-transport (CT) aerospace industry is 
the development of aluminum alloys with higher specific strength 
(strength/weight ratio) for subsonic aircrafts; this research focus is 
obviously owing to lower cost of aluminum as compared to titanium and 
composites. The 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys have remained in long use 
in CT subsonic aircrafts. For instance, age-hardenable 2024-T3 aluminum 
alloy is used in the subsonic structure: an aircraft for military transport 
application. The 7075-T6 Al alloy sheets and plate products have 
applications in subsonic aircraft structures owing to their notable 
combination of high strength with moderate toughness and corrosion 
resistance [6, 7]. In addition to Al alloys, titanium aerospace alloys are 
known for their high specific strength, moderately high-temperature 
stability, and resistance to corrosion. The exceptionally attractive 

Materials Selection in Design of Structures                Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  445 
 
properties of titanium alloys render them suitable for applications in both 
subsonic and supersonic aerospace structures. The aerospace industry is the 
single largest market for titanium and its alloys. For instance, the high 
corrosion resistance of titanium alloys renders them to be used in hatch and 
door edging where moisture is likely to be accumulated. A detail account of 
titanium alloy applications in given in section 3. 
 
Now, we focus our discussion on supersonic aircrafts. In one of the first 
supersonic transport (SST) aircraft design, Concorde, aluminum alloy was 
selected as the primary structural material based on the fact that Mach 2 was 
chosen as the design cruise speed. However, such design of Concorde was 
rejected by almost every country due to its sonic boom and also because 
that the pollutants exhausted from its engine may deplete ozone. Sonic 
boom is the “thunder-like” noise produced when a plane is traveling faster 
than the speed of sound [8]. This is the reason why almost all today’s 
supersonic aircrafts are designed for military use, which are mainly made of 
lightweight carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite materials 
that excel in specific strength, fatigue strength, corrosion-resistance, and 
has reasonably high creep strength [9, 10]. Another criterion in the 
aerospace composites is their ability to be repaired when the skin of the 
aircraft panel becomes disbonded [11]. In addition to military aircrafts, 
CFRP are also extensively used in SST aircrafts. For example, much of the 
fuselage of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB are 
made of CFRP. 
 
OPERATING CONDITIONS AND MATERIAL SELECTION 
 
Environmental Service Conditions 
 
In aircraft material’s section, a complete understanding of expected service 
conditions is very important. Besides that, other important factors include 
the identification of design criteria, and the testing and evaluation of 
structural concepts. Typical variables that must be considered in both sub- 

446  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Zainul Huda 
 
and supersonic designs include operating stresses and temperatures, loads, 
ambient environmental conditions, moisture and fluid exposures, radiation, 
maintenance, and ground handling [12, 13]. In particular, exposure to 
extremes in temperature (ranging from about −30°C to 370oC), moisture 
(extreme humidity to desert conditions), and radiation (especially 
ultra-violet) can either cause degradation of coatings and structural 
materials or exacerbate the damaging effects of flight exposure conditions. 
Furthermore, discrete damage events, both on the ground and in flight, stay 
as a threat to polymer composite and thin-skinned components. The 
discrete damage may be caused by hail impact, lightning strike, transport 
and handling, and foreign objects [14]. For supersonic aircraft, the 
flight-cycle conditions are determined by speed at cruise, altitude, flight 
loads, and spike (or failure) conditions. The supersonic civil transport 
(SCT) aircraft should be designed for a lifetime of approximately 20,000 
flight cycles, which equal about 60,000 flight hours [15]. A major portion of 
this flight cycle will be under supersonic cruise conditions at speeds 
between Mach 2 and Mach 2.4.

Materials Selection in Design of Structures                Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  447 
 
Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in a particularly deleterious form of 
environmental attack on aircraft structures that will create opportunities 
for cracks to nucleate and grow to failure, even under limited fatigue 
loading conditions. In fuselage lap joints, the crevice corrosion that occurs 
will result in pressure build up between the layers, sometimes to the point 
where rivet heads will pop off and the joint will look pillowed, such as 
shown in Fig. (1). 
 
LOADING CONDITIONS AND DESIGN RELATIONSHIPS 
 
During its flight, an aircraft may be subjected to four types of loading: (1) 
tension, (2) compression, (3) bending, and (4) torsion. Minimization of 
aircraft weight while still satisfying strength requirements is an important 
objective in material selection for both subsonic and supersonic aircrafts. 
For subsonic applications, lightweight structure results in cost-saving on 
fuel; whereas high speeds are achieved by lightweight structures for 
supersonic aircrafts. The relationship of each of the four loading types and 
the overall weight of the aircraft are discussed as follows [16]. 
 
Design Equation for Tension 
 
For a tensile loading below the yield limit, the applied stress on a structural 
component (e.g. fuselage) should be considered regarding its weight (W). In 
comparing specific strengths of two materials: (a) and (b), the design 
relationship may be expressed as: 
 
(W(a) / W(b)) = [(ρ(a)  σy(b)) / (ρ(b)  σy(a))] 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
where W(a) is weight of a part using material (a), W(b) weight of the part with 
material (b); density of materials (a) and (b) are denoted as ρ(a) and ρ(b) , 
respectively; σy(a) and σy(b) are yield strengths of (a) and (b), respectively. 
 

448  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Zainul Huda 
 
Design Equation for Compression 
 
Under compression, an aircraft part may fail due to buckling; this loading 
condition requires the selected material has a high stiffness (Young’s 
modulus, E). In comparing two materials (a) and (b), the following 
compression relationship is recommended for the aircraft designer: 
 
(W(a) / W(b)) = (ρ(a) /ρ(b))[(E(b)/ E(a))]1/3  
 
 
 
(2) 
 
Design Equation for Bending 
Under bending, a structural member, such as the aircraft wing, is subjected 
to both tensile and compressive stresses, thus the following relationship 
should be applied when comparing the two materials: 
(W(a) / W(b)) = (ρ(a)/ ρ(b))[σy(b)/σy(a)]1/2  
 
 
 
(3) 
where the symbols have the same meanings as mentioned in Eq. (1). 
Design Equation for Torsion 
Thin-walled tube is a popular airframe component, which are subjected to 
torsional stresses. Under torsion, the relationship between two materials 
may be expressed as: 
(W(a) / W(b)) = (ρ(a) τ(b)/ ρ(b) τ(a)) 
 
 
 
 
(4) 
where τ(a) and τ(a) are torsional shear stresses acting on materials (a) and (b), 
respectively. 
Eqs. (1-4) provide useful tools for an aerospace designer to select the best 
material for a specific aircraft structural member with respect to the type of 
loading applied on it. Although Eqs. (1–4) provide useful design 
relationships in selection of aircraft materials, they do not completely 

Materials Selection in Design of Structures                Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  449 
 
satisfy all design requirements. In order to meet all requirements, fracture 
mechanics has to be applied during the design process. 
MATERIALS SELECTION FOR AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE ----    
A DESIGN APPROACH 
Design philosophy relationship has to be applied when considering safety 
issue in material selection, as explained in [17-19]: 
K = KIC = Y σ (πa)1/2  
 
 
 
 
 
(5) 
where K is stress intensity factor, KIC the plane strain fracture toughness, σ 
is the stress which acts along a normal direction to the major axis of a 
central crack of length 2a (or an edge crack of length a) in the component, 
and Y denotes geometric compliance function that describes the geometry 
of the structural component. In order to achieve a safe design, material’s 
fracture toughness has to be selected to guarantee that KIC> K in order to 
prevent crack propagation. 
 
The design philosophy {see Eq. (5)} is of paramount importance for 
selecting an appropriate material for safe design of a part for either 
subsonic or a supersonic aircraft. For instance, the British de Havilland 
Comet 1, G-ALYP Aircraft fractured due to fatigue crack propagation; 
which in turn was due to incorrect design approach for material selection. 
A lower fracture-toughness 7000 series aluminum alloy was selected for 
application in wing skin of the aircraft on the basis of its high strength and 
light weight; hence KIC was fixed. The design stress, σ, on the wing was 
then set at a high level to achieve a high payload capacity for the aircraft. 
Using input values of KIC and σ, Eq. (5) was used to define flaw size, a. 
During the crash flight, a fatigue crack grew out from a hidden rivet hole 
in one of the wing plates and propagated to the critical size of ac, where 
conditions of Eq. (5) are met. The result was fracture. The most 
unfortunate aspect of the fracture was the fact that the allowable flaw size 
that could be tolerated by the material under the applied stress was 

450  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Zainul Huda 
 
smaller than the diameter of the rivet head; and hence it was impossible 
for the inspection people to detect the crack which grew to fracture. In 
fact, the designers should have used a different approach. They should 
have first fixed the two variables namely high-level stress, σ, and the 
critical flaw size, ac; and then should have applied Eq. (5) to define the 
required fracture toughness KIC. This approach would have resulted in the 
selection of material of appropriate fracture toughness to avoid the failure. 
Because of the stringent operating conditions that supersonic flight, it will 
be helpful to combine the application of high-performance aluminum alloys, 
titanium alloys and polymer matrix composites in the aircraft structure. 
Section 3 discusses the performance characteristics of each class of the 
three aerospace materials. 
 
In selecting materials for structural parts of modern high-performance 
aircrafts Materials Selection Charts, such as Ashby chart, should be used 
[20, 21]. An Ashby plot is particularly helpful for designing a stiff and light 
part of an aircraft. In an Ashby plot, a candidate material is located as a 
point on the plot based on its Young's modulus and density. With that plot, 
users can easily find a material with the highest stiffness, the lowest density, 
and even the best (E/ρ) ratio. Traditional materials selection charts are 2D 
plots and becomes inefficient for advanced aircraft design. In 2011, M.F. 
Ashby reported the development of an advanced 3D Materials Selection 
Chart, which comprehensively takes Young’s modulus-density-fracture 
strength into consideration within a single chart. This chart allows for a 
correct and quick material selection for advanced aircraft design [22]. 
 
Today’s aerospace designers are expected to efficiently determine materials 
for different structural components in a designed aircraft. A remarkable 
progress in this field has been made through the development of 
computer-based and web-based materials-selection systems. An aerospace 
engineer is able to quickly decide materials for both sub- and supersonic 
aircrafts with assistance of these IT-based systems (e.g. CES Selector)

Materials Selection for Subsonic Structures (for Speeds ≤ 1.0 Mach) 
 
The skin temperature during a subsonic flight is usually below 70 oC. This 
non-stringent thermal condition enables aerospace designers to use 
non-expensive age-hardened aluminum-copper alloys or aluminum lithium 
alloys for subsonic aircraft’s structures. Aluminum (alloy) is the primary 
aircraft material, comprising about 80 per cent of an aircraft's un-laden 
weight. Because the metal resists corrosion, some airlines do not paint 
their aero-planes, saving several hundred of kilograms in weight. In 
particular, series 2xxx, 6xxx, and 7xxx Al alloys find wide applications in 
subsonic aerospace structures. For instance, the ALCLAD 2024-T3 alloy is 
being used in C-130 Hercules (a subsonic aircraft for military transport 
applications) by Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) [2]. Additionally, the 
age-hardened 2024-T3 aluminum-copper alloy is used in fuselage, wing 
tension members, shear webs, and structural areas where stiffness, fatigue 
performance, and good strength are required. The selection of heat 
treatment approaches for the aerospace Al alloys play an important role in 
strengthening the alloys for supersonic applications [26]. The 
age-hardening heat treatment for the alloy involves solution treatment 
(heating) in the range of 450-550 oC and holding for about 1 hour followed 
by quenching. The solution treated alloy is then either naturally or 
artificially aged [17]. Fig. (2) illustrates the steps in age hardening of Al-Cu 
alloys. 
 
The 7075-T6 alloy (Al-5.6Zn-2.4Mg-1.6Cu-0.3Mn-0.5Fe-0.4Si-0.22Cr- 
0.2Ti alloy) is the most commonly used age-hardened alloy for subsonic 
structures and highly stressed parts of the aircraft [27]. The 6061-T6 

452  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Zainul Huda 
 
aerospace alloy has considerable application for extrusions requiring thin 
sections and excellent corrosion resistance. Additionally, the high-strength 
powder-metallurgy (P/M) Al alloys (e.g. CT90, CT91, 9051, etc.) and 
aluminum-lithium alloys have been successfully used in subsonic aircrafts 
[28]. 
 
Fig. (3) shows use of various aerospace aluminum alloys in subsonic 
aircraft’s structures.

Besides aluminum, titanium alloys have wide applications in subsonic 
aircraft’s structure. The moderately high-temperature stability of titanium 
alloys enables them suitable for application in fuselage skins and flame 
preventing fire safety-proof membranes of subsonic aircrafts. Additionally, 
the high-strength Ti-6Al-4V is the most commonly used alloy for 
application in subsonic-aircraft’s highly-loaded assemblies (e.g. landing 
gear, fastening elements of the wing, and the like). Although aluminum 
alloys are cost-effective aerospace structural materials, composite materials 
offer better weight reduction; and hence are increasingly used in the 
structure of modern passenger aircrafts (e.g. Airbus A330) (see Fig. 4) [29]. 
Composite materials reduce weight (typically 20% less weight than 
aluminum), and are known to be more reliable with a longer lifespan than 
other traditional metallic materials; thereby reducing aircraft maintenance 
costs, and frequency of inspections during service. This is why composite 
materials contribute 25% structure (particularly fuselage frames) of the 
Airbus A380; however, the composite frames features aluminum strips to 
ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage (for dissipating lightning 
strikes).

Materials Selection for Structures with Speeds ≤ 2.0 Mach 
 
When supersonic transport aircrafts (SSTA) fly at a speed of about 1.8 
Mach, the temperatures are below 100oC. Under that temperature level, 
both the aluminum and CFRP composite laminates can be selected for the 
fuselage of SST aircrafts. Considering the complexity of manufacturing 
process and its cost, aerospace aluminum alloys should be preferred over 
composites for SST aircrafts flying at speeds up to 1.8 Mach. The 
heat-treated aluminum alloys: 2024-T81, T6, T62, or T81 are more suitable 
for extruded members, while 2014-T6, 2024, and 2618-T61 are best for 
forged products located in the areas that will be affected by heat in an 
aircraft. An aerospace designer can refer to Table 1 for selecting aerospace 
aluminum alloys for supersonic applications at speeds up to 2.0 Mach.

 It is evident from the data in Table 1 that although the 2219-T87 aluminum 
alloy is easy to manufacture (10% elongation at break), its applicability in 
modern supersonic aircrafts is limited by its low yield strength. 
Comparatively, the easy-to-fabricate 7075-T6 alloy and the new 
(heat-treated) type 2-mm Al-Zn-Mg-Sc-Zr alloy (with the highest 
elongation at break of 12%) meet strength requirements for the modern 
SCT aircrafts [27, 31]. In fact, 7075-T6 is the primary material for making 
honeycomb panel frames, which are machined from plate to eliminate 
corner joints. The aluminum honeycomb can also be used in the beaded 
areas of skin doublers to stiffen the skin of fuselage. At elevated 
temperatures, 2024-T81 foil provides higher strength than the work 
hardened alloys, such as 5052-H39 and 5056-H39. Since lithium is the least 
dense metallic element, the alloying of Li with Al can substantially reduce 
the weight of aerospace alloys. For instance, 2090-T651 can be used in 
fuselage bulkhead webs and internal framework parts. Another lightweight 
Al-Li alloy is 8090-T651 has a high melting range of 600-655 oC, which 
places it the best option for building the extendable nose. 
 
The skeleton of the supersonic aircraft needs to be light but strong enough 
so as to withstand high pressure applied on it. Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V has 
excellent corrosion resistance, machinability, and the strength-to-weight 
ratio and is an ideal material for the skeleton [32, 33]. A skeleton made of 
Ti-6Al-4V will not be affected by the heat due to the friction because of the 
(Table 1) contd.....

high melting point of titanium (1668 °C). In addition, the very low thermal 
expansion (8.6 μm·m−1·K−1) at 25 °C of titanium provides excellent thermal 
stability of the aircraft during supersonic operation. 
 
Materials Selection for Structure for Speeds Between 2.0 and 4.0 Mach 
 
The temperature of skin of the supersonic aircraft is a function of its speed 
and also depends on its environment. The skin temperature at first drops 
when the aircraft climbs and goes to contact with the decreasing ambient air 
temperatures. As the speed exceeds Mach 1, the ambient air temperature 
begins to increase, and the skin temperature reaches a maximum of 120 °C 
(248 °F) when the aircraft is cruising at Mach 2.2. The skin temperature 
stays below 100 °C (212 °F) at a speed of Mach 2.0 and reaches 150 °C 
(302 °F) when the speed reaches Mach 2.4. As shown in Table 2, for a 
hypersonic aircraft whose speed higher than 4.0 Mach, the skin temperature 
may exceed 370 oC.

The data in Table 2 clearly suggests that high strength and high 
heat-resistant composites should be applied for current supersonic aircrafts 
that fly at speeds in the range of 2.5-4.0 Mach. For example, the SR-71 
Blackbird jet could fly continuously at Mach 3.1 with the temperature of 
some parts reaching or even exceeding 315 °C (600°F). Most recent 
high-temperature carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), such as 
graphite fiber/PMR-15 and graphite fiber/PMR-11-55, can properly 
function for thousands of hours under temperatures between 290 and 

Materials Selection in Design of Structures                Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  457 
 
345 °C. Due to this reason, both SCTAs and military aircrafts are made of 
CFRP to achieve a higher fuel efficiency. 
 
The data in Table 3 provides a guideline for designers to select best CFRP 
for supersonic aircrafts under different operating conditions. For example, 
the CFRP with high elastic modulus should be selected for high Mach 
speeds.

Specific materials for each part of the SST aircraft are now selected based 
on the operating conditions of the parts in supersonic aircrafts and the 
temperature resistance of the materials. Fig. (5) indicates that 2650 Al alloy, 
a cost effective material which can resist long-term creep at temperatures 
ranging from 100 to 130 °C, is the ideal candidate for the fuselage skin of 
the SST aircraft. For example, the application of 2650-T8 alloy showed that 
it did not deform by more than 0.1% under a 150 MPa stress during a period 
of its 60,000 h service life [34]. 
 
As shown in Fig. (5), different parts of the aircraft are heated up to different 
temperatures during flight, therefore they have to be made of different 
materials. Specifically, the temperature at the nose and around wings are 
significantly higher than that along the fuselage. It is then decided that 
high-temperature CFRP (such as graphite fiber/PMR-15, graphite fiber/ 

458  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Zainul Huda 
 
PMR-11-55) should be used for making the fuselage and advanced CFRP 
with better heat resistance should be used for the nose and around the wings. 
A good candidate is carbon fiber reinforced epoxy, which possesses 
excellent specific strength (450 GPa/kg/m3) (see Fig. 6) [7], and is 
recommended for speeds in the range of 2.5-3.5 Mach. 
 
 
Fig. (5). Variation and distribution of skin temperatures for Mach 2.2 and 2.4 SST aircrafts. 
 
Today’s high-speed supersonic flights require advanced aerospace 
materials that can properly function under extremely high temperatures. For 
example, engine nozzles of military aircraft need to be operated at a 
temperature as high as 399 °C (750 oF) for thousands of hours. High- 
performance composites have been developed to fulfill that requirement. 
Those composites include polyimides, bismaleimides (BMIs), cyanate 
esters (CEs), benzoxazines and phthalonitriles [35]. Among them, 
polyimides, bismaleimides (BMIs), cyanate esters (CEs), andbenzoxazines 
have outstanding temperature resistance and are recommended for speeds 
above 3.5 Mach. The phthalonitrile resin system (graphite fiber- 
phthalonitrile composite) developed at the United States Naval Research 
Laboratory, Washington, DC can survive when exposed to elevated 

Materials Selection in Design of Structures                Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  459 
 
temperatures up to 371 °C for longer time periods [36]. Comparatively the 
epoxy-based systems used in current naval aircrafts start to lose their 
rigidity or shear strength (depending on the moisture content of the resin) 
when the temperature approaches 150 °C. For those applications asso- 
ciated with short exposures times (such as missile applications), it was 
shown from high-temperature tension tests that graphite fiber composites 
fabricated using the phthalonitrile resin system can maintain their tensile 
strength to under 538 °C. Epoxy-based graphite fiber-reinforced composites, 
however, will dramatically lose their tensile strength at temperatures 
around 260 °C during a similar exposure time (Fig. 7). From Fig. (7) it can 
be deduced that that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of graphite-epoxy 
drops nearly 50% at 316 °C. On the other hand, the graphite-phthalonitrile 
does not suffer significant degradation until the temperature exceeds 482 °C. 
It is therefore specially recommended for application in nose and around 
wings of the supersonic aircraft when its flying speed stays around 3.5 
Mach.

Material-Selection for Military Aircraft Wings 
In this section, the material for military aircraft wings is selected following 
Weighted Relative Property Rating Procedure, which is illustrated in (Table 
4). In that procedure, only metallic materials are considered because the 
composites do not have a sharp yield point (σy). As shown in the last 
column of Table 4, weighting factors have been allocated as follows: 10 for 
mechanical properties, 20 for temperature resistance (if the aircraft speed 
reaches Mach 4.0), and unity for cost. 
 
The analysis of data in Table 4 indicates that stainless steel should be the 
optimum choice for the specific application. However, with its outstanding 
corrosion-resistance capability and low density, titanium alloy should be 
preferred if the supersonic aircraft speed is below 3.0 Mach.

In conclusion, the best scheme of selecting materials for the military aircraft 
wings should be a combination of stainless steel (or composite), titanium 
alloy, 
and 
high-temperature 
aluminum 
alloy 
(2650-T8). 
This 
materials-selection recommendation is made based on the wide 
temperature range to which the wings may be heated up during the 
supersonic flight (Fig. 8). 
 
A NEW MATERIALS SELECTION CHART FOR SSTAs 
 
Based on the previous discussions of pros and cons of different aerospace 
materials, Table 5 is developed which allows aerospace designers to select 
appropriate materials in designing structural components for subsonic and 
supersonic aircrafts that are cruising at speeds within different Mach 
number ranges. In Table 5, a strong dependence between the cruise speed 
and the material selection strategy is presented. Table 5, combined with the 
material properties, as displayed in Figs. (6 and 7) provide an effective tool 
for selection of supersonic aircraft materials.

 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
In this chapter, methods and guidelines of selecting appropriate materials 
for subsonic and supersonic aircraft structural components have been 
reviewed. It is concluded that during the material selection, the most 
important part is to correctly identify the expected service conditions of the 
designed structures, which include operating stresses and temperatures, 
compressibility effects, ambient environmental conditions, moisture and 
fluid exposures, radiation, lightening-strike, maintenance, ground handling 
etc. Strength and thermal properties of a variety of aerospace materials have 
been reviewed. The materials-selection tool Weighted Relative Property 
Rating procedure is introduced and has been applied to select materials for 
a supersonic aircraft wings. A unique materials-selection table is presented 
to facilitate the selection of structural materials with respect to different 
cruising speeds.

INTRODUCTION 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have since their relatively recent discovery, been 
employed in a multitude of different scientific applications such as sensing 
[1], mechanical systems [2], energy storage [3, 4], biological applications 
[5, 6], and field emission [7, 8]. The expanding usage of composite 
materials on current commercial and military aircraft has in this respect 
highlighted these materials as viable candidates that can sustain different 
operational requirements in aeronautics and astronautics. 
 
This chapter provides an introduction to CNTs, by means of a brief 
historical overview of CNT usage in aerospace applications, viewed 
through the lens of the aerospace industry and further investigates their 
prospective usage areas in aeronautics and astronautics. In this context, 
particular attention is devoted to potential benefits of CNTs intended for 
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their proposed usage, and other 
aspects pertaining to future space launch platforms. The final discussion of 
this chapter features a review of obstacles that have prevented a more 
frequent utilization of CNTs in the aerospace industry and establishes 

470  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                      Omid Gohardani 
essential factors for such implementation. 
 
In essence, CNTs are commonly described in the literature in two distinct 
forms namely, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and 
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [9]. SWCNTs consist of single 
tubular sheets of graphite while the latter comprise a family of concentric 
graphite tubes [10]. For SWCNTs, the roll direction of the graphite sheet 
and the tube structure denoted by the integers n and m, determines the 
conductivity. The chiral vector is defined as Ch ≡ (n, m) [11], where the 
values of m and n determine the structure of the nanotube as an armchair  
(n = m), zigzag (m = 0) and chiral (other n and m values than the previous 
two structures). An overview of the properties of SWCNTs and MWCNTs, 
in comparison to traditional aerospace materials, is shown in Table 1.

HISTORICAL 
OVERVIEW 
Many review articles have been authored on the topic of CNTs, focusing 
mainly on their properties [9, 16, 17], present state [18] and future 
applications [10, 19]. The myriad of review and research articles describing 
CNTs therefore render a complete literature list, to be beyond the scope of 
this chapter. 
 
Consequently, a selection of studies based on their actual applications 
pertinent to aerospace applications, are discussed herein. The first 
nano-sized carbon filaments of tubular nature were studied in 1952 [20]. 
However, this publication became available in English numerous years later. 
Following the aforementioned study, a number of elaborated research 
studies were independently carried out on the observations of fullerenes 
[21-25]. The scientific impact of the article published by Iijima in 1991 [26], 
with its novelty and dissemination to a broader scientific community, 

472  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                      Omid Gohardani 
conversely came to be considered as the birth year of MWCNTs. This topic 
has however, attracted some scientific discussions, due to existing evidence 
of CNTs preceding this date [27]. Given the general acceptance of 1991 as 
the inception year of CNTs, this date has been adopted as the 
commencement year of CNTs in aerospace sciences [12]. 
 
A literature excursion on CNTs in different databases such as Compendex, 
Inspec, the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), and Referex, 
clearly indicates that the number of publications related to these materials 
has increased since the year 2000, as shown in Fig. (1). Within these 
publications, the number of articles containing the keyword “aerospace” 
has augmented from less than 0.25% to 1.8% in 2013, signifying the 
potential prospects of CNT usage in aerospace sciences. In addition, the 
low percentage also confirms their limited current implementations in this 
discipline.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) published a 
significant roadmap for prospective applications of nanomaterials and 
particularly CNTs in 2010 [28]. This roadmap identified that potential 
benefits of utilizing CNTs in aerospace applications to consist of reduced 
vehicle mass, improved functionality and durability, enhanced tolerance to 
damage, improved self-healing characteristics, and enhanced thermal 
protection. Moreover, this report outlined that CNTs can be utilized for 
enhanced energy generation and distribution. Some identified challenges 
related to usage of CNTs in aerospace applications comprise large-scale 
production methods of CNTs, uniform dispersion of CNTs in composite 
materials, alignment and adhesion issues associated with CNTs in 
reinforced polymers, and a complete understanding of their toxicity and 
production of CNTs, rendering them rice in volume, with a uniform size.

Despite the numerous original research articles and published reviews 
related to CNTs, it would take numerous years since their authenticated 
introduction, for a thorough review to emerge on this topic, specifically 
intended for the field of aerospace. In 2014, Gohardani et al. [12], 
published the very first consolidated review article of the prospects of 
utilizing CNTs and nanoparticles in aerospace sciences, based on their 
recent implementations and predicted future applications. Fig. (2), depicts 
an overview of some milestones related to CNTs and their applications in 
aerospace sciences. 
 
CARBON NANOTUBES IN AERONAUTICS 
 
In aeronautics, CNTs have the potential to become utilized in different 
implementation areas, such as the airframe, wiring, aircraft icing mitigation, 
propulsion systems, lightning protection, electromagnetic interference 
shielding, stealth applications, structural damping, and sensing. Lower 
weight consideration, has been one of the challenges constantly faced by 
the aerospace industry throughout the history of aviation. Stemming from 
economic reasons, a light aircraft or rotorcraft is often desired without the 
risk of sacrificial structural integrity. For future commercial aircraft, 
employing distributed propulsion technology, Gohardani et al. [29] 
identified the total weight and propulsive power as the two dominant 
factors likely to influence aviation. In addition, Gohardani’s first proposed 
official definition for distributed propulsion technology in subsonic 
ﬁxed -wing aircraft [30, 31], considers materials such as CNTs to be crucial 
for future designs in the aerospace industry. 
 
The large surface area for a given volume and reinforcement effects caused 
by a high aspect ratio [32] therefore, render nanocomposites suitable for 
aeronautical applications. The influence of CNTs on the weight, range and 
fuel consumption of commercial aircraft, was in a pioneering study 
examined by O’Donnell [33] and colleagues [34, 35]. In these simulations, 

Applications of Carbon Nanotubes                      Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  475 
a carbon reinforced polymer (CNRP) was used as the primary airframe 
material on four conceptual aircraft structures, namely the Boeing 747-400, 
Boeing 757-200, Airbus A320, and Embraer E145. By interchanging the 
conventional aluminum material with CNRP with 70% by volume 
SWCNTs, an average 14.1% weight reduction, with a corresponding 13.2% 
range increase and 9.8% decrease in fuel consumption, was obtained. 
Despite the unfeasible practical application of this study on the current fleet 
of aircraft, the authors have successfully exhibited the weight saving 
potential of CNTs, through their research. 
 
Reduced fuel consumption and weight reduction can potentially be 
obtained in aeronautics by replacement of the existing copper wiring with 
wires made of CNTs [36-38]. For a current commercial airliner, the copper 
wiring accounts for approximately 4,000 lbs in weight. Studies with a CNT 
cable called 1553B, indicate a 69% weight saving potential, due to 
interchanged wiring [39]. Additional research carried out by Northrop 
Grumman, as a part of environmentally responsible aviation (ERA), under 
contract with NASA on a N+2 advanced vehicle study, indicate that CNT 
data cables can contribute to 0.1% improvement of the fuel burn reduction 
for the Cargo 2025 preferred system concept (PSC) and a corresponding 
value of 0.2%, for the Passenger PSC. This research also predicts the 
development risk for the aforementioned cables to be moderate, by the year 
2025 [40]. 
 
Aircraft icing is another discipline within aeronautics with adverse effects 
on aircraft during flight. These effects may comprise a reduction of lift, stall 
angle of attack and increased profile drag [41]. This phenomenon 
commonly occurs upon existence of super-cooled droplets in the 
atmosphere, impinging on the surfaces of an aircraft during flight [42]. A 
recent study, carried out by Chu et al. [43] demonstrated a high efficiency 
of a carbon nanotube paper (CNP) in deicing applications. The composite 
in this study exhibited excellent electric heating properties at a wind speed 

476  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                      Omid Gohardani 
of 14 m·s-1 during ambient temperatures, resulting in deicing time intervals 
between 220–450 s. Similarly, Zhao et al. [44], utilized functionalized 
MWCNT sheets anchored onto carboxyl, by means of a photochemical 
reaction. Upon integration by the resin infusion method, a steady-state 
value of the sample temperature was obtained within 13 s, at a power 
density consumption level of 0.58 W·in-2. 
 
Novel concepts in aeronautics, suggest turboelectric generators to be 
implemented at the wing tips and fans across the rear of the fuselage, on the 
blended wing body (BWB) aircraft [29-31, 45]. The justification for 
utilizing small-diameter motors stems from their high magnetic field 
intensity and the produced force in relation to size [46]. CNTs are proposed 
to be used on carbon electric motors, with efficiencies in proximity of those 
with copper. Given that hydrogen is one of the alternative fuels with 
positive environmental impact, Dillon et al. [3] studied a high reversible 
hydrogen storage capacity of SWCNTs, hence attracting an increased 
interest related to the application of CNT usage in hydrogen storage. 
 
The introduction of composite materials into the airframe of modern 
aircraft, imparts certain challenges, besides beneficial aspects related to 
increased fuel efficiency, reduction of acoustic emissions and pollutants. 
One such challenge, is a lower electrical conductivity in comparison to 
aluminum airframe, should the aircraft be subject to a lightning strike threat 
[12]. 
 
During such event on an unprotected surface, electricity with current levels 
up to 200,000 A, traverses the path of least resistance [47], and might ensue 
in resistive-heating, acoustic shock, ignition of vapors in the fuel tanks, 
arcing, sparking at joints, and melting or burning at the lightning 
attachment points [48, 49]. Fig. (3), depicts an aircraft’s lightning zones: 
Zone 1 indicates the prospective area to be influenced by the initial 
attachment of a lightning strike, Zones 2 and 3 designate a swept/moving 

Applications of Carbon Nanotubes                      Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  477 
attachment and an area which may experience non-attached conducted 
currents of a lightning strike, respectively [48, 49]. 
 
Fig. (3). Aircraft lightning zones as designated by SAE aerospace recommended practices 5414. 
(Source: Adapted from [12]). 
 
Gou et al. [47] attributed inadequate level of attained electrical conductivity 
for lightning strike protection, due to heavy re-agglomeration levels of 
CNTs and CNFs at high viscosity of the polymer resin and a limitation in 
increased conductivity beyond the percolation threshold, originating in the 
absence of effecting connection between the nanofillers. To alleviate these 
effects, the authors introduced nickel nanostrands for bridging individual 
CNFs and for modifying the electrical pathway within the carbon nanofiber 
papers (CNFPs). The subject of lightning strike protection by employment 
of CNTs, has also been studied elsewhere [50]. 
 
Sensing, is yet another prospective future application of CNTs. Self-sensing 
entails that component diagnostic data is passively collected and preventive 
signals supplied, in order to avoid control component failures [51, 52]. 
Moreover, these signals can be employed for optimization of the operating 
configurations of the component [53].

For military aircraft, stealth technology is crucial for survival of the system. 
Stealth performance is often represented by the radar cross section (RCS), 
which is described as the strength of the radar signal backscattered from an 
object for an incident electromagnetic wave and equally a measure of the 
amount of reflected electromagnetic wave from an incident electromagnetic 
wave [54]. The RCS can be minimized by modification of the external 
features of the target, utilizing radar absorbing materials [55] and radar 
absorbing structures. In one such study, Kim and Lee [54] have utilized 
CNTs to achieve absorption of incident electromagnetic waves up to 90% in 
the X-band frequency. 
 
Morphing aircraft is an emerging aerospace technology, in which CNTs 
usually are mentioned as envisaged materials [12]. Morphing structures 
enable the different surfaces of the airframe to adapt to existing conditions. 
By way of example the wings may adapt to flight conditions, i.e. 
instantaneously unfurl, bend and reshape, based on changes in pressure, 
temperature, and exposure to magnetic and electric ﬁelds [56]. An artist’s 
rendering of the “Morphing Airplane” is shown in Fig. (4).

shear strength is ~25 times the value of non-functionalized CNTs, when 
approximately 1% of the carbon atoms in CNTs are covalently bonded to 
the epoxy resin. 
 
Recent Studies 
 
An extensive research effort has been carried out by Gohardani [41] since 
2011, on the prospects of CNTs in aeronautics. A review study conducted 
on erosion modeling in particular with materials reinforced with CNTs, 
exhibited such modeling to be highly complex in nature [59]. In a different 
study, empirical liquid erosion experiments conducted on polymeric matrix 
composites reinforced with CNTs, exhibited nominally similar damage 
threshold velocities as the non-reinforced composites. The liquid erosion 
experiments were conducted upon utilizing Cavendish Laboratory's 
Multiple Impact Jet Apparatus (MIJA) [60]. Based on the aforementioned 
study, the CNT dispersion level did not appear to result in significantly 
higher damage threshold velocities (DTVs), confining the aerospace 
applications of the candidate materials to UAVs, with a cruise speed less 
than Mach 0.4, such as the generic unmanned air vehicle (GUAV) [61]. 
 
Since wettability of materials reinforced with CNTs, has been an interesting 
topic for aeronautical applications, Gohardani and Hammond [62] explored 
the wetting character of these materials by utilizing the Dynamic and Static 
Wettability Scheme for Advanced Materials (DSWSAM). The described 
methodology was employed in order to numerically examine, empirically 
acquired results based on their wettability. This study also described a 
decision matrix that discriminated between hydrophobic and hydrophilic 
surfaces based on their static and dynamic wettability properties and 

480  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                      Omid Gohardani 
presented idealized wetting character representations of the examined 
aerospace materials [62]. The usefulness of CNTs for aircraft icing 
applications was further studied by Gohardani and Hammond [63] and 
additionally by Gohardani [64]. 
 
CARBON NANOTUBES AND UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES 
 
The employment of CNTs on electric UAVs, can contribute to favorable 
flight characteristics [12]. In a study conducted by Thomas and Qidwai 
[65], it was demonstrated that the flight endurance of an electric UAV can 
be extended 1.5 times more, for a given vehicle weight reduction versus 
an increased battery energy. 
 
Given the numerous future application areas of UAVs, the need for icing 
protection systems has recently been more emphasized. Granted that 
UAVs exhibit a lower climb rate than other military, rotary- and 
ﬁxed-wing aircraft, ice accretion is more prone to ensue in destabilization 
of the aircraft [66]. For this purpose, many different methods for icing 
mitigation for UAVs have been undertaken by researchers in recent years 
[67, 68]. 
 
CNTs are capable of providing additional benefits for tackling the 
challenges currently faced by UAVs related to aircraft icing. With 
expansion of the mission envelope and the operational usability of UAVs, 
Battelle [69] has developed a Resistive Heating Coating (RHC) 
technology, which alleviates the aforementioned issues by means of a 
lightweight coating system applicable as a spray-on system to areas where 
ice formation mitigation is desired. The hindrance of ice accretion and its 
shedding is attained by a stack of coatings, in which the dispersion level 
of CNTs in combination with the barrier coating and paint layers enable a 
high conductivity, upon employment of electrical current, which results in 
a heated surface. This technology stands out due to its lower power 

Applications of Carbon Nanotubes                      Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  481 
densities in line with the limited available power for UAVs and traditional 
coating application methods, enabling the retrofitting of this system onto 
existing airframes. 
 
Recent Studies 
 
Pertaining to aircraft icing challenges on UAVs, a recent study [70] on 
small UAVs addresses the issues associated with structural change, caused 
by ice accretion by integration of a power control system and an 
electrically conductive coating based on carbon nano material, providing 
temperature control of the UAV’s airfoil surface. Results obtained in this 
study indicate that a coating covering the entire length of the wing 
provides both de-icing and anti-icing capabilities when needed, at 
moderate energy consumption levels. 
 
CARBON NANOTUBES IN ASTRONAUTICS 
 
The Space Elevator concept has been one of the envisioned ideas for space 
transportation that has attracted a considerable amount of attention, since 
the discovery of CNTs [12, 71-81]. A Space Elevator is essentially a 
physical connection from Earth’s surface to Geostationary Earth Orbit 
(GEO) located approximately at an altitude of 36,000 km, by means of a 
proposed cable made of CNTs, on which magnetic levitating vehicles travel 
[12]. 
 
There are many benefits associated with the realization of the Space 
Elevator. Upon its establishment, the Space Elevator may reduce the 
current high costs associated with placement of small payloads into Low 
Earth Orbit (LEO), enabling equipment to be brought back to Earth and a 
rapid cargo launch [82]. Equally, numerous challenges have been identified 
with this concept consisting of susceptibility to lightning strikes, potential 
meteorite damages, LEO cable impacts, atomic oxygen damage, and micro 
scale defects [12, 74, 77].

The benefits of CNTs in large satellite applications consist of weight 
reduction of a satellite to one-third of its current weight [28]. A weight 
saving potential is also evident for other spacecraft upon CNT usage, as 
illustrated by the work of Harris et al. [83]. For terrestrial and satellite 
communications systems, patch antennas fabricated from CNTs exhibit 
advantageous features such as a planar structure, low-profile, gain ~ 7 dBi, 
and bandwidth of 5–20% [84]. 
 
Immediate applications of CNTs in space applications can be beneficial in 
order for onboard computer screens to operate in the vicinity of other 
electronic equipment at the International Space Station and in future space 
exploration missions [85]. These missions will require that computer 
screens onboard the space vehicles have coatings with at least 90% 
transmittance and a shielding effectiveness ~40 dB [12]. 
Recent Studies 
In a recent study [86], polyimide (PI) infiltration into entangled cup-stacked 
CNT (CSCNT) sheets preserved the beneficial properties of CNTs, while 
preventing agglomeration and enabling CNT patterning. The obtained 
CNI-PI films exhibited low sheet resistivity values in both lateral and 
vertical direction, in line with as-grown CNT sheets, while preserving a 
high conductivity during thermal and mechanical manipulations. The 
developed CNT-PI films are hence rendered suitable as an alternative for 
electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection layer in spacecraft thermal blanket, 
given their durable exhibited character. 
 
CHALLENGES RELATED TO CARBON NANOTUBE USAGE IN 
AEROSPACE SCIENCES 
 
A number of factors are essential in addressing the challenges currently 
faced by the aerospace industry prior to full implementation of CNTs. 
These factors consist of health and safety concerns, large scale production, 

Applications of Carbon Nanotubes                      Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  483 
adequate quality at a low cost, achievement of optimized properties upon 
CNT implementation, as discussed in further details elsewhere [12]. In 
particular, it is essential for CNTs to be available at full large-scale 
production levels, in order to meet the demands of the industry [87]. 
Current advancement of 3D printing may further open new avenues for 
usage of CNTs in aerospace sciences, with aims to realize optimized 
material properties at a low cost. 
 
The most important aspect that needs to be explored prior to full-scale 
implementation of CNTs in aerospace applications, is according to 
Gohardani et al. [12], an adequate assessment of the health and safety 
concerns related to these materials. Given that CNT exposure has exhibited 
adverse health effects on animals [12], a complete health risk assessment is 
mandatory prior to introduction of these materials in the aerospace industry.

Many aspects associated with the implementation of CNTs in aerospace 
applications, still remain unexplored. Some of these have briefly been 
highlighted in Table 3. The ambiguous health and safety effects and hazards, 
in conjunction with long time exposure effects on humans, necessitates 
further research, prior to a well-deﬁned i mplementation o f C NTs i n

certiﬁcation of new products and technologies for the aerospace industry 
featuring CNTs, will be prolonged due to challenges, such as those 
associated with health and safety originating from the novelty of these 
materials. Once recognized standards and a certiﬁcation f ram ework for

Abstract: The current use of fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft is 
only possible by the development of innovative lightweight constructions and the use 
of lightweight materials, such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics. With the rising 
demand on fiber reinforced components in the aerospace industry new production 
processes have been built up. However, current production technologies for 
composites cause higher costs and obtain longer process cycle times in comparison 
to the manufacturing processes of metals. Moreover raw materials, such as carbon 
fibers and resin, and semi-finished products are very expensive. In contrast to this 
and compared with other manufacturing technologies for fiber reinforced plastics

Sheet Molding Compound compression processes are characterized by cost 
efficiency, high productivity, the option of full automation and the possibility for 
the realization of complex shapes and integrated functions. However there are also 
some disadvantages like a low level of stiffness and strength in comparison to 
continuous fiber reinforced plastics. The reasons for these facts are the short fibre 
length, a lower fibre-volume fraction and an isotropic fibre distribution. 
Consequently, the combination of sheet moulding compound and pre-impregnated, 
tailored carbon fibre reinforcements in an one-shot compression moulding and 
curing process merges the advantages of both groups of composite materials. 
Therefore the creation of load-bearing, complex, functional and autoclave-quality 
parts without an autoclave can be realised. In this chapter, this innovative 
technology and its potentials are presented. This paper will also deal with the 
resulting material characteristics.

INTRODUCTION 
In the recent decades, the demand for efficient and fuel-saving aircraft for 
the commercial air traffic has led to the development of innovative 
lightweight solutions and to an increasing use of modern lightweight

materials, such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). In this context 
the aerospace industry developed new manufacturing processes and 
enhanced existing technologies to produce such high-performance 
materials. However, the today's production of aerospace components 
made of FRP materials is time-consuming and costly in comparison to the 
production of metallic constructions. Reasons for this are relatively high 
costs of raw materials and semi-finished products, long processing times 
and a partially low degree of automation. As a result there exist lots of 
aspirations for the development of more efficient technologies, the 
optimization of existing processes or the smart combination of different 
technologies. 
 
One promising technology is the combination of carbon fiber Sheet 
Molding Compound (SMC) and pre-impregnated, continuous carbon fiber 
reinforcements in a one-step compression and curing process. In this 
context the SMC technology provides the implementation of light, 
geometrically complex and highly functional composite components 
considering short cycle times, an optimum usage of material, the 
possibility of complete automation and high cost efficiency. The locally 
integrated continuous carbon fiber reinforcements obtain tailored 
mechanical properties depending on the load characteristics of the 
respective component and with regard to the required high lightweight 
potential. In addition, this hybrid composite technology promises the 
possibility of using of recycled carbon fibers as long fiber reinforcements 
in the SMC mass and the direct integration of metallic components. This 
material and process combination can realize light weight, complex and 
functional composite components for aerospace applications in a highly 
efficient way. 
 
The main objectives of this article are researches and analysis of the 
potentials of this technology in reference to aerospace applications with 
the requirements for secondary structures of commercial aircraft.

STATE OF THE ART 
 
Today, some successful developments and research efforts in the field of 
thermoplastic composites and hybrid material already exist. In this regard 
the combination of injection molding and organo-sheets obtain the best 
opportunities for hybrid thermoplastic composite materials. Over-molded 
organo-sheets combine short and continuous carbon fiber reinforcements 
to realize functional thermoplastic composite parts with complex shapes, 
excellent mechanical performance, lightweight properties and complex 
shapes. Appropriate components have recently appeared in electronics 
and automotive industry. In addition, these over-molding technologies can 
be extended by integrating metal components [1]. 
 
In contrast to these developments there are no comparable technologies 
for thermoset composites and appropriate material combinations available 
on the market. In general Sheet Molding Compounds are characterized by 
lower mechanical properties than composites reinforced by continuous 
fibers. The reasons are the random fiber distribution and lower fiber 
volume contents. Therefore the mechanical properties of Sheet Molding 
Compounds can be increased by using fiber reinforcements like 
embedded unidirectional carbon fiber layers. 
 
This kind of material is used for a few industrial applications, especially 
in the automotive sector. Typical Sheet Molding Compound applications 
for vehicles or trucks are fenders, hoods, deck lids, spoilers, scuttle panels, 
floor panels, tailgates, wheel arches and many more [2, 3]. In contrast to 
the mentioned applications Sheet Molding Compounds are not well 
established in aerospace industries. Reasons are absent dimensioning 
methods, purer mechanical properties, and lower weight-saving potentials 
in comparison to typical aircraft materials. Nevertheless, there are several 

Tailored Carbon Fiber Reinforcements                     Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  501 
 
developments on cabin, cargo and other secondary structure parts because 
of the excellent fire safety properties, high flame retardancy and 
high-quality surface finishing of some special Sheet Molding Compound 
formulations based on unsaturated polyester resin. Some aerospace 
applications for primary structure parts in the field of compression 
molding, for example by using HexMC®, were already commercialized. 
However, the combination of tailored, continuous carbon fiber 
reinforcements and carbon fiber Sheet Molding Compounds with the 
possibility of the direct integration of metal components represent a new 
technology approach for the aerospace industry. Therefore, highly 
integrated parts could be designed and produced by means of this hybrid 
composite technology in a cost-efficient way [4-10]. 
 
AIM AND PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT WORK 
 
The present work follows the intention to develop a new hybrid 
composite technology for the production of future aircraft. This 
technology shall include innovative material combinations, new 
multi-material designs and an efficient production process. The 
combination of carbon fiber Sheet Molding Compounds and 
pre-impregnated, tailored carbon fiber fabrics in a one-step compression 
and curing process permits the production of lightweight, load-bearing 
and highly integrated aircraft parts, shown in Fig. (1). This technology 
combines the flowability of long fiber reinforced Sheet Molding 
Compounds and the tailored mechanical properties of continuous fiber 
fabrics, which are impregnated by the thermoset matrix system. Such a 
combination allows the production of components with high functionality, 
complex shape, high freedom of design and excellent mechanical 
properties. Therefore, the level of fiber content and mechanical 
characteristics like flexural strength and tensile strength could be adapted 
exactly to the load cases and the requirements of the appropriate part [11].

Fig. (1). Process cycle of the combination of pre-impregnated carbon fiber fabrics and carbon fiber 
SMC.
In addition these thermoset composite combinations can be directly 
combined with metallic components, e.g. inserts, nuts and plates, 
according to the part design and the required material complexity in the 
compression process. On the one hand these composite parts can be used 
for load-bearing secondary structure components which should have a 
complex shape or should include a lot of different functions, e.g.
functional cabin monuments, fittings to structural components, 
attachments for system installations or complex housings. On the other 
hand parts of the primary structure with a complex shape, an exact 
adaption to the load cases and with integrated fittings, fasteners and 
openings can be realized in one step. Moreover innovative grid structures 
on inner shells of aircraft could be put into practice with this technology. 
Besides the possibility of integral construction, tailored carbon fiber 
reinforcements for load path optimized mechanical properties and a 
reduction of adhesives, rivets, shim or additional fittings can minimize 
weight, production times and costs of the parts. In addition, lower 
material costs and a better buy-to-fly ratio, as a result of an optimized 
material usage, are causing an additional decrease of part costs. 
Furthermore the proposed hybrid manufacturing technology creates 
higher productivity and lower production costs due to low cycle times, 
less time for part assembly or finishing and the possibility of complete 
automation. In this context such a compression process lead to less energy

consumption in aerospace production. 
 
Possible materials for reinforcements are carbon fibers, glass fibers and 
natural fibers which can be combined with different thermoset matrix 
materials, for example unsaturated polyester resin, vinyl ester resin or 
epoxy resin. Besides it is possible to use carbon fiber recyclates, 
especially as long fiber reinforcements in SMC formulations. Using 
recycled carbon fibers made out of end-of-life cycle aircraft parts or 
cutting scrap of the current aerospace production can close the ecological 
value chain referring to future aircraft. These fibers can be final products 
from recycling processes like pyrolysis. These carbon fibers keep up to 95 
percent of the original mechanical properties and obtain a lower price 
level than new carbon fibers. In this context, this technology realizes the 
reuse of expensive and energy-intensive resources as reinforcement 
materials for aircraft parts again. Possible areas of application can be 
cabin and cargo structures. As a result the ecological sustainability and the 
resource efficiency of aerospace production for composite aircraft 
components will be improved. 
 
Therefore an interdisciplinary project for several investigations on 
material combinations, process parameters and lightweight constructions 
using the described technology has been started. The aim is the realization 
of different cabin and cargo components of commercial aircraft. In this 
context these secondary structure parts have to fulfil appropriate 
aerospace requirements. To obtain some information about technical, 
economic and ecological performance these components will be 
compared according to relevant requirements with the currently 
assembled ones. In addition a complete feasibility analysis shall relate this 
production process to current composite technologies to highlight its 
expected advantages for aerospace industries. Finally special simulation 
methods and FEM-models will be developed for designing, dimensioning 
and calculating hybrid composite aircraft parts which will be produced 

504  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                           Fette et al. 
 
with this combination technology. 
 
In a first feasibility study the substitution of a cargo foot step for a current 
commercial short and middle range aircraft, which is currently made of 
titanium, has been analyzed. Lead time reduction, cost savings and weight 
reduction as results of increased mechanical properties, especially tensile 
strength, flexural strength, stiffness and impact strength, are the key 
aspects for the planned optimization. Subsequently, the industrial 
introduction of this manufacturing process and the substitution of other 
aircraft components will follow. Therefore completely new possibilities 
for aircraft production and a new generation of hybrid composite 
structures for future aircraft will be created. 
 
Experimental Procedures 
 
In a cooperation project Polynt Composites Germany GmbH and Airbus 
Operations GmbH have developed a special Sheet Molding Compound 
formulation called HUP 27 GF25 (Table 1). It is based on an un- 
saturated polyester resin (UP) and contains many additives, especially the 
flame-retardant additive aluminum hydroxide or alumina trihydrate 
(ATH). Because of a high percentage of flame-retardant components HUP 
27 meet the requirements on fire safety and flame retardancy of the 
aircraft cargo section. In this regard, aerospace materials have to pass the 
following Airbus specific tests, which are required in the cargo area of 
commercial aircraft: 
 AITM 2.0002: Flammability vertical, 60 s test A; 
 AITM 2.0007: Measurement on smoke density; 
 AITM 3.0005: Determination of the toxic components on 
combustion products and measurements on toxicity;

non-volatiles, contain a high amount of non-organic materials. The 
proportions of non-organic components are a big challenge in comparison 
to the organic ones for the Sheet Molding Compound processing. In 
general the SMC compression process is configured for viscosities from 
lowest level 10.000 mPas to 50.000 mPas. Without any process additives 
it is not possible to produce a homogenous paste for a stable process. It is 
not allowed to influence the burning behavior negatively by the use of 
such additives. To obtain better impregnation of the carbon fiber 
reinforcements the viscosity has to be reduced. The building of the 
reinforcement works if the matrix-reinforcement-bonding is adequate to 
transfer the mechanical properties on the complete Sheet Molding 
Compound formulation. Otherwise the mechanical improvement is not 
given by such a system. The flowability of the system is an important 
parameter for the impregnation of the complete system and the orientation 
of the fibers within the compression process. In the first step different 
material combinations are tested to receive basic material characteristics 
in reference to flexural modulus, flexural strength, tensile modulus, 
tensile strength and impact strength. In this case nine reasonable material 
systems have been analyzed due to different possibilities of 
reinforcements, listed in Table 2.

The materials with chopped fiber reinforcements are used as inert systems 
for mechanical data base and for the outer systems. The materials with 
continuous fiber fabrics or unidirectional fibers are used for the inner 
layer, illustrated in Fig. (2). The mechanical properties determined for flat 
Sheet Molding Compound plates are molded according to DIN EN 14598. 
These plates have a thickness between 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm. The test 
specimens are cut from the non-flow area of a sample plate with the 
dimension of 250 mm x 120 mm and with molding conditions of 180 
seconds at 145 °C. Afterwards the cut specimen is milled to the accurate 
dimension according to the standard specification.
The Sheet Molding Compound formulations for these different material

the mechanical properties as a result of the integration of tailored, 
continuous fiber reinforcements and exact adaption to the load cases.

DISCUSSION ON RESULTS
The results generated by the experimental investigations on the different 
material combinations are shown in Figs. (3 to 5). The parameters 
investigated are flexural modulus, flexural strength, tensile modulus, 
tensile strength and impact strength. There are significant differences 
between the measurements, especially in reference to the used type of 
fiber and depending on the combination of the different fiber
reinforcements.
In general, the measurements indicate that higher fiber contents and the 
use of chopped carbon fibers, instead of glass fibers, for Sheet Molding 
Compound formulations can realize an improvement on flexural and 
tensile modulus, illustrated in Fig. (3). Furthermore woven fabrics and 
unidirectional layers of carbon fiber combined with Sheet Molding 
Compounds tend to result in an increase of the mentioned mechanical 
properties. Especially, HUP 27 with chopped carbon fibers (50 percent 
fiber content) combined with an unidirectional carbon fiber layer or a 
carbon fiber woven fabric can realize a significant improvement of 
flexural and tensile modulus. In contrast, Fig. (4) shows that the flexural 

Tailored Carbon Fiber Reinforcements                     Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  509 
 
strength is hardly influenced by additional and oriented reinforcements. 
The reason for this could be the chemical adaption of HUP 27 to glass 
fibers. As a consequence, HUP 27 samples with carbon fiber 
reinforcements are partially delaminating. This is caused by poor 
interlaminar shear strength behavior. Furthermore, the high percentage of 
flame-retardant components lowers the fiber content, downgrades the 
impregnation and leads to the degradation of the interlaminar connection 
between the carbon fibers and the matrix material (Fig. 6).

In general the tensile strength can be increased by additional continuous 
fiber reinforcements, shown in Fig. (4). In this regard, the integration of 
unidirectional layers of carbon fiber doubles the tensile strength in 
comparison to the original Sheet Molding Compound formulations. In 
opposition to that the combination of HUP 27 and carbon fiber fabrics 
realizes just a small improvement of the tensile strength.

The impact strength is positively affected by material combinations of 
glass fiber reinforced HUP 27 and additional carbon fiber reinforcements, 
especially woven fabrics of carbon fiber, illustrated in Fig. (5). Due to the 
poor interlaminar shear strength between carbon fibers and HUP 27 there 
is no improvement of the impact behavior. In the case of HUP 27-CF 50% 
combined with carbon fiber fabrics the impact strength is even reduced.

All in all a positive trend of the mechanical properties by the combination 
of Sheet Molding Compounds and continuous fiber reinforcements can be 
stated. For further optimization of the material characteristics the Sheet 
Molding Compound formulations have to be adapted to the particular 
fiber reinforcements. As a result, the interlaminar shear strength will be 
improved. Furthermore, Sheet Molding Compound materials have to be 
optimized for the impregnation of the reinforcements and to increase the 
flowability of the Sheet Molding Compound material during the molding 
process. The stacking of the layers, the fixing of the continuous fiber 
reinforcement during the molding process and the mechanical 
requirements of the components are additional topics being worth to be 
investigated in order to improve the mechanical properties. All things 
considered, the key aspect for realizing a hybrid composite component is 
the exact adaption of Sheet Molding Compound formulation, oriented 
fiber reinforcements and part requirements, such as mechanical properties 
or flame redardancy.

CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the outcomes of this study, it is expected that the development 
of the combination of SMC and pre-impregnated, orientated carbon fiber 
fabrics is auspicious referring to an improvement of mechanical 
properties and lightweight potentials. This technology promises optimized 
lightweight and load-bearing properties in connection with complex 
shapes and design freedom. However, for aerospace applications there 
does not exist a special Sheet Molding Compound formulation yet. 
Consequently, each material combination has to be developed for or 
adapted to the requirements of the particular application. In this regard the 
design and geometry of the components are important, too. For the design, 
the dimensioning and the simulation special material models and finite 
element method simulation tools have to be developed. In reference to the 
process the pre-forming, the preheating, the positioning and the fixing of 
the wrought materials, especially the orientated carbon fiber fabrics, have 
to be considered. Further studies will focus on the analysis and 
optimization of process parameters such as flowability, molding 
temperature, molding pressure and molding time. In addition the 
integration of metal components such as inserts, fasteners or panels will 
be realized. For the industrialization of the process an automation concept 
with different batch sizes and part designs has to be evaluated in regard to 
the technological, economic and ecological aspects. Although there are 
many open questions, this innovative, hybrid composite technology offers 
outstanding benefits, extended potentials and a lot of applications within 
the aerospace and also other industries.

Abstract: Automated fiber placement (AFP) machines can steer the 
fibers/tows to make the so-called variable stiffness (VS) composites. They 
allow the designers to fully exploit the directional properties of composite 
materials to tailor the internal load distribution and improve the structural 
performance. VS composites have been shown to be very promising in 
the design optimization of composite panels and shells for buckling and 
post-buckling performance and consequently for further reducing the 
mass of future aerospace structures. In this chapter, the buckling 
performance improvement of VS composite cylinders with circular and 
elliptical cross sections is investigated. A metamodeling based design

INTRODUCTION 
 
Lightweight and high performance are essential requirements for 
aerospace structures. In case of using metallic materials, designers put all 
their effort to reduce the weight and optimize the structural performance 
by tailoring the topology and shape of the structure i.e. thickness, size, and 
overall profile/shape. Over the past few decades, the application of 
fiber-reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) materials in aerospace 
structures has been increased dramatically. This growth has primarily been 
fueled by the high stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratios of FRPC 
materials as well as tailorability of the stiffness and strength properties and 
substantial reduction in part count offered by such material systems. 
Unlike metallic structures, composite structures can be manufactured in 
very complex geometric shapes. Consequently, FRPC materials can help 
enhance both product performance and manufacturing. 
 
FRPC materials have traditionally been designed and manufactured as 
multi-ply laminates consisting of several unidirectional layers. The layers 
are either stacked in dry form with the polymer resin injected into the 
mold or the layers are pre-impregnated with the resin material prior to 
manufacturing. In either case, for product design and manufacturing 
simplicity, the fiber orientation angle in each layer is typically held fixed 
and usually limited to 0°, 90°, and ±45°. By limiting each layer to a single 
orientation angle over the entire structural component, the designer is

unable to fully exploit the directional material properties offered by 
composite layers. On the other hand, without sophisticated manufacturing 
equipment, it would be nearly impossible to accommodate spatial 
variation of orientation angles in the individual plies. With the advent of 
Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) machines, it has become possible to 
steer the fibers to manufacture composite parts with continuously varying 
fiber orientation angles. The resulting so-called variable stiffness (VS) 
laminate has spatial stiffness properties that allow the full potential of 
composite materials to be harnessed by extending the design space to 
create structural components with significantly higher performance and/or 
lower weight [1-5]. However, there are several design and manufacturing 
challenges that need to be addressed to reach the full potential of VS 
composite structures made by fiber steering. 
 
Early research works on AFP technology were reported in the literature in 
the late 1980’s [6]. Followed by building composite stiffened panels by 
AFP machines [7, 8] in the early 1990’s, AFP technology was used in 
production of numerous aircraft parts such as the F/A-18E/F horizontal 
stabilizer skins, the Bell/Boeing V-22 Osprey aft fuselage [9, 10], the V-22 
grip [11-13], the Boeing JSF inlet duct and the C17 landing gear pod 
fairings and engine nacelle doors [9,14], and the fuselage sections of 
Raytheon Premier I and Hawker Horizon business jets [15]. The recent 
application of AFP technology includes the large scale production of the 
fuselage sections of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A380 and A350 
XWB [16, 17]. The overall saved labor costs and reduced scrap materials, 
combined with the ability to produce laminated composite components of 
exceptional quality with higher accuracy and repeatability, have been 
shown to cover the substantial investment required by AFP technology. 
 
VS composites have been extensively studied for several loading 
scenarios and different structures such as plates [2, 18-21] and cylindrical 
shells [4, 5, 22-24] to examine the effect of fiber steering in improving 
structural performance and reducing weight. Since in aerospace structures 

518  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Rouhi et al. 
any weight savings through reduction of skin thickness must be balanced 
against the requirement for structural stability, the buckling performance 
have mostly been studied for VS structures. 
 
Hyer and Charette [25] have studied the structural improvement by using 
curvilinear fibers in a flat plate with central hole subjected to tensile and 
compressive loads. They concluded that in tension the curvilinear designs 
lead to improved performance. In compression, however, the buckling 
loads were not as high as for quasi-isotropic (QI) laminates. In a follow-up 
work, Hyer and Lee [26] constrained the variation of the orientation angles 
to increase buckling resistance while producing designs that could be 
fabricated. As a result, and by combining both straight and curvilinear 
fibers, the best buckling and failure results were achieved. Afterwards, 
Nagendra et al. [27] explored that VS laminate made bu curved fibers 
could improve the buckling load of the plate-with-hole problem addressed 
by Hyer and Lee [26] up to 85% compared with the initial constant 
stiffness (CS) design. The research on VS laminates was continued by 
Gu¨rdal and Olmedo [28] in the early 1990’s at Virginia Tech (USA). 
Followed by achieving promising results in terms of stiffness and buckling 
generated by analytical and numerical methods [28-30], several VS 
structures were fabricated [31] to validate the manufacturability of 
tow-steered laminates. Subsequent testing [32] confirmed the improved 
load-carrying capability of the VS panels over their CS counterparts. The 
reason for the substantial improvements was attributed to the redistribution 
of the load from the centre of the panels to the higher-stiffened edge 
regions. The research was followed by a number of Prof. Gürdal’s research 
group [33-38] at Delft University of Technology. 
 
Besides plates and panels, VS cylinders were also investigated for their 
potential improvement in structural performance. They have been shown 
to be very promising in terms of the structural performance improvements 
they can offer compared with their constant stiffness (CS) counterparts 

Variable Stiffness Composite Structures                    Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  519 
[3-5, 22, 23, 26]. Circular and conical cylinders have been extensively 
studied for structural improvement via stiffness tailoring. Blom et al. [4] 
could improve the bending-induced buckling load of a VS circular 
cylinder up to 17% with respect to a baseline laminate at the same weight. 
Khani et al. [22] could improve the buckling load of a VS cylinder about 
24% over its best constant stiffness (CS) counterpart. The research works 
on VS cylinders were not limited to those with circular cross sections. 
Elliptical cylinders were also studied for their potential improvement in 
axial buckling performance [5, 22, 39]. The axial buckling capacities for 
elliptical cylinders were reported up to 30% for the cross sectional aspect 
ratio of 0.7 [5]. As an objective different from the buckling performance, 
White and Weaver [23] have studied the potential of stiffness tailoring to 
achieve bend-free states in pressure vessels with elliptical cross sections. 
 
In this chapter, a metamodeling based design optimization (MBDO) 
method for VS composite cylinders is presented. Using MBDO, circular 
and elliptical cylinders are investigated for potential improvement in their 
buckling capacity. Circular cylinders are subjected to bending-induced 
buckling and elliptical cylinders are examined for axial buckling 
performance. effects of length aspect ratio and radius (cylinder size) on the 
bending buckling of VS cylinders are studied. Additionally, the effect of 
the percentage of plies candidate for steering on the overall buckling 
improvement is investigated. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) 
method is also presented for design of VS cylinders subjected to multiple 
loads. 
 
MODELING AND ANALYSIS 
 
As shown in Fig. (1a), assume that a composite cylinder with a finite 
length is subjected to a pure bending load. For a prescribed stacking 
sequence, say [0/θ/90/-θ/-θ/90/θ/0]s, with a number of plies candidate for 
fiber steering (θ-plies), the main question is: “what is the optimum fiber 

520  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                          Rouhi et al. 
path for VS plies so that the buckling capacity is maximum?”. To limit the 
infinite number of variations of the fiber orientation angle for VS plies, a 
piece-wise constant model is used where the cylinder is divided into a 
number of narrow bands in which the fiber orientation angle is assumed to 
be constant but different from its neighboring regions. This way, the 
stiffness tailoring problem is reduced to finding the fiber orientation angle 
in each narrow band shown in Fig. (1b). To further reduce the number of 
design variables, the orientation angles in a number of equally spaced 
narrow bands are assumed to be the design variables (Ti’s) as illustrated in 
Fig. (1c). The orientation angles of the narrow bands in between these 
regions are calculated by a linear interpolation between the values of the 
orientation angles in these design points. Therefore, the orientation angles 
in the equidistant narrow bands on the surface of the cylinder are 
considered as design variables to be determined for maximum buckling 
capacity of the cylinder: 
 
Max.  Fcr = f (Ti’s) 
s.t. 0° ≤ Ti ≤ 90°; i = 1, . . ., NDV  
 
 
 
(1) 
 
where Fcr is the buckling capacity of the cylinder in terms of the design 
variables (Ti’s) and NDV is the number of design variables. It should also 
be noted that in case of a different loading scenario, the piece-wise 
constant model for the continuous variation of the orientation angles may 
need to be arranged in a different direction. 
 
For any set of design variables, using the commercial software ABAQUS, 
a finite element model is constructed and the structure is analyzed for 
buckling. Table 1 shows the mechanical properties of the constituent 
materials used in the composite laminate (AS4D/9310 Carbon/Epoxy). 
Followed by a mesh convergence study, the cylinder is discretized into an 
appropriate number of segments on the circumference and the length. The 
S8R5 shell elements of ABAQUS were used in this study that have 8

piece-wise constant model to approximate the continuous variation of the orientation 
angle in a VS ply, and (c) reducing the number of design variables to the values of the 
orientation angles in some particular narrow bands. 
 
It is worth noting that in this study, the layup sequence is assumed to be 
previously designed (based on stacking sequence considerations) and the 
design optimization problem is reduced to find the optimum orientation 
angle variation of those plies candidate for fiber steering. Therefore, the 
assumed design domain is not claimed to fully cover the entire design 
space (including the stacking sequence optimization). One of the 
theoretical approaches to fully explore the design space is using the 
lamination parameters [41, 42] as design variables; however, one of the 
difficulties associated with using this method is that it is not capable to 
incorporate the strength constraints in the design optimization procedure 
[35].

DESIGN OPTIMIZATION 
 
The design optimization is usually an iterative process which may require 
hundreds or thousands of function evaluations. In case of costly function 
evaluations (FEA), as in this case, it poses a very big challenge for the 
design optimization process. Therefore, the high fidelity models are 
replaced by efficient surrogate models (metamodels) that are approximate 
mathematical functions that provide approximate responses (function 
values) at a design point. Another advantage of metamodeling techniques 
is that they can change the noisy responses into a smooth one resulting in a 
more appropriate function for finding the global optimum. 
 
Metamodeling here includes calculating the structural response (buckling 
capacity) of the VS composite cylinder in a limited number of training 
points (sample points) using the FEA and fit an analytical function to the 
produced responses from these points. The sample points or the design of 
experiment (DOE) are generated using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) 
method to create a well-distributed population in the design domain. To 
evaluate the metamodeling error, a number of test points are also 
generated for which the response (buckling load) are evaluated for them 
Table 1. Material properties of the unidirectional carbon/epoxy layers. 

Variable Stiffness Composite Structures                    Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  523 
by using both metamodel function and FEA. The average error was 
calculated as a representation of the metamodel’s error. 
 
Among several metamodels used in a diverse set of engineering design 
optimization problems [43-45], radial basis functions (RBF) has been 
shown to be the most dependable in terms of accuracy and robustness [46, 
47] including the design optimization of VS composites structures [24, 48, 
49]. First step in metamodeling is to generate the sample points or the 
training points, the so-called design of experiment (DOE). For each 
training point of the DOE, a high fidelity FEA is performed to calculate 
the buckling capacity of the VS composite cylinder. This is followed by 
fitting the RBF metamodel so that it passes through all these training 
points. The resulted efficient RBF surrogate model is used for function 
evaluation in the optimization process (Eq. 1). Metamodeling is followed 
by calling the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization tool to find the 
optimum design variables. The population based GA method is used to 
guarantee the optimum point to be global. 
 
As stated earlier, since metamodels are approximate functions, responses 
predicted by surrogate models have some errors when they are compared 
with those calculated by the high fidelity models. Therefore, the calculated 
optimum design point may not be as accurate as it is required. Increasing 
the number of training points is one way to reduce this error. This, 
however, asks for the highly increased number of training points and 
consequently highly decreased computational efficiency. Another 
approach, as suggested here, is using the multi-step optimization method 
[50], in which the side constraints of the design variables (lower and upper 
bounds) are tightened about the optimum points calculated from the 
previous design optimization step and the optimization process is repeated 
for the design variables with the new bounds until a convergence is 
reached. Fig. (2) schematically shows the multi-step design optimization 
procedure.

RESULTS 
 
4.1. Bending-Induced Buckling of a Circular Cylinder 
 
Fig. (3) shows the buckling mode shapes of a composite cylinder with 
quasi-isotropic (QI) laminate along with its optimized VS counterpart. The 
stacking sequence for the cylinders is assumed to be [0/θ/90/-θ/-θ/90/θ/0]s 
in which θ = 45° for QI cylinder and fiber steered (variable in 
circumferential direction) for VS cylinder. For a cylinder with 
length=diameter=18 in, the buckling capacity of VS cylinder (VS: Fcr = 
11.62e5 Nm) is about 25% larger than its QI counterpart (QI: Fcr = 9.31e5 
Nm). As Fig. (3) reveals, the VS cylinder exploits more area in carrying 
the compressive load compared with the QI one. The more efficient use of 

Variable Stiffness Composite Structures                    Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  525 
directional properties in VS cylinder is the result of the optimum 
distribution of the orientation angle (θ) in the circumferential direction as 
shown in Fig. (4), in which θ starts from a low value in the bottom (keel) 
which is under tension and increases to a large value at the top (crown) 
which is under compression. This way, the axial stiffness is increased in 
the tension side while it is decreased in the compression side to create an 
efficient load path for maximum buckling capacity. This is quantitatively 
shown in Fig. (5) in which the axial section forces are plotted over the 
circumference of the cylinder for both QI and VS laminates. It shows how 
the stiffness tailoring made by curved fiber paths reduces the maximum 
stress in the compression side and transfers the load to the tension side and 
consequently results in an increased area involved in carrying the 
compressive loads for VS cylinder compared with QI one. The fiber paths 
on a steered ply of the developed VS cylinder is illustrated in Fig. (6).

4.1.1. Effect of the Aspect Ratio (L/R) 
 
Keeping the thickness and radius of the cylinder unchanged, one may 
change the length of the composite cylinder and design the optimum VS 
laminate for each length to study the effect of the aspect ratio (L/R). Fig. 
(7) shows the result of such a study in which the potential improvement of 
the bending-induced buckling capacity of a VS cylinder increases with the 
decrease of its aspect ratio (L/R). In other words, there is more room for 
improvement in the buckling performance for shorter cylinders than the 
long ones. The baseline to calculate the improvements in both cases are 
the composite cylinders with QI laminate.

aspect ratios (L/R). 
 
4.1.2. Effect of the Radius (R) 
 
In thin-walled structures, thickness ratio (R/t) is one of the important 
parameters that may affect the overall performance. To study the effect of 
the thickness ratio (R/t), the thickness were kept fixed but the radius and 
the length of the cylinder were changed so that the aspect ratio (L/R) 
remains unchanged. Although the cylinder becomes bigger with the 
increase of its radius and consequently the bending-induced buckling load 
increases for both VS and QI cylinders, the improvement of VS cylinders 
compared with their QI counterparts did not seem to considerably change 
with the radius as long as the aspect ratio (L/R) and thickness (t) are kept 
constant (Fig. 8).

4.1.3. Effect of the Steered Plies Percentage 
 
To study the effect of steered plies percentage in a laminate on the 
buckling performance, in the [0/θ/90/-θ/-θ/90/θ/0]s stacking sequence, one 
may add other plies (0°- or 90°-plies) to the list of layers candidate for 
fiber steering. The layup sequence can also be changed to examine its 
effects on the overall performance. Rouhi et al. [51] studied several layup 
sequences with different percentage of steered plies in the laminate and 
their result is shown in Fig. (9). As expected, increasing the number 
(percentage) of the steered plies in a laminate results in an increased 
design space and consequently more room for structural improvement. For 
the composite cylinder considered in this study, a VS composite laminate 
with 100% of plies candidate for fiber steering results in about 33% 
improvement in the buckling load which is 6% more than the 
improvement when 50% of plies are steered (25%).

4.2. Multi-Objective Design Optimization for Bending-Induced Buckling 
 
Generally, aircraft structures are subjected to multiple load cases that must 
be considered in the design process. Therefore, the overall objective 
function in the design optimization process must systematically and 
simultaneously include a collection of individual objectives that may 
oppose each others. The resulting so-called multi-objective optimization 
(MOO) process [52] can be formulated and solved by different methods of 
which compromise programming is one of the the most common 
approaches. The objective function in the compromise programming is a 
weighted combination of all individual objective functions. As an example 
in this study, the bending load can be applied in two opposite directions 
and the VS cylinder must be designed to have maximum buckling capacity 
when the bending load is applied in either of the two opposite directions. If 
the VS cylinder is designed for maximum buckling capacity in only one 
direction, the buckling performance of the cylinder will be as shown in Fig. 
(10a) when the direction of the applied load changes. It results in about 

Variable Stiffness Composite Structures                    Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  531 
25% improvement of the buckling load for one direction, but at the 
expense of 57% decrease in the buckling capacity if the bending load is 
applied in the opposite direction. To simultaneously improve the buckling 
capacity in both directions a multi-objective design optimization is needed. 
The general multi-objective utility function that combines all individual 
objectives can be expressed as the weighted exponential sum: 
 
 
 
 
 
(3)
 
where p is a nonzero power term to be adjusted to capture Pareto optimal 
points 
[52], 
𝜔
 is 
a 
vector 
of 
weights 
such 
that 
 is a utopia point (also called an ideal 
point for each objective function). It is worth noting that the power term p 
= 2 resulted in maximum improvement in the buckling load for both 
directions. The relative values of the weight (𝜔i) generally reflects the 
relative importance of each individual objective (Fi(x)). For a composite 
cylinder in which the bending loads are applied in two opposite directions 
(n = 2), the utopia point (𝐹𝑖
0) for each objective in Eq. 3 is set to be the 
maximum buckling load in case the bending load is applied only on that 
direction. 
 
For 𝜔1 = 𝜔2 = 0.5 in which the same importance is considered for the 
bending loads in both directions, the buckling performance of the cylinder 
is shown in Fig. (10b). The MOO results in a VS cylinder that has about 
9% improvement in the buckling capacity in either of the two opposite 
directions. As the main decision making tool for designers, Rouhi et al. 
[24] generated the Pareto optimal points (Pareto frontier) by changing the 
weight factors (𝜔i’s) and performing MOO for different combinations of 
the weight factors.

4.3. Axial buckling of an Elliptical Cylinder  Structural design in real applications are always constrained by many limitations. Specifically in aerospace applications, aerodynamic considerations may dictate non-circular cross sections for a cylinder such as in blended wing body aircraft structures. The non-uniformity of curvature, as a result, reduces the buckling capacity of the structure [5]. Stiffness tailoring seems to be a good candidate to compensate the inefficiency resulting from the structural non-uniformity.  As an example to demonstrate this potential, assume that a 15 inch long elliptical cylinder with b = 8.191 in, a = 20.477 in , and simply supported boundary conditions is subjected to axial buckling as shown in Fig. (11). The design problem in this case would be to find the optimum fiber paths on the surface of the elliptical cylinder (see Fig. 12) so that the buckling load is maximum. Using the MBDO method presented in this study for an elliptical cylinder with a balanced symmetric 8-ply laminate made of AS4D/9310 carbon/epoxy materials and [±θ1/±θ2]s stacking sequence the

For the sake of comparison, the buckling capacities of the same elliptical cylinder with the optimum CS laminate (Optimum constant values of θ1 and θ2), as well as a QI laminate [±45/0/90]s were also calculated. For such a structure Fig. (13) shows the buckling mode shapes of QI, best CS, and optimum VS cases. The most efficient usage of the directional properties of the composite materials via fiber steering in the VS design in which most of the area is involved in carrying the compressive load. Fig. (14) also shows the orientation angle distribution on a quarter circumference of the elliptical cylinder from one end of the major axis to one end of the minor axis. It reveals a general trend of the optimum orientation angles (θ1 and θ2) to start from a large values in the curved portion of the circumference (to make laminate soft in axial direction) to small values in the flatter portion (to make laminate stiff in axial direction). Therefore, the material properties are tailored so that the structurally stiff parts becomes stiff material-wise, and the other way around so that a more collaborative and efficient involvement of the structure and material is obtained for buckling performance. The buckling load capacity of VS elliptical cylinder (VS: Fcr=123.787 kN) shows about 104% improvement over the CS design (CS: Fcr=60.811 kN) and 144% improvement over the QI one (QI: Fcr=50.787 kN). As such, the design optimization results reveals that there is a substantial room for buckling improvement of cylinders with non-circular cross sections [53].

CONCLUSION 
 
The potential room for improvement in the buckling performance of 
composite cylinders via fiber steering was studied in this chapter. The 
resulting so-called variable stiffness (VS) composites were designed by 
using a metamodel based design optimization (MBDO) method. By 
exploiting the full potential of the directional properties of the composite 
laminates, the curved fibers were shown to create efficient load paths to 
substantially improve the buckling performance. 
 
For circular cylinders with short lengths under bending-induced buckling 
loads, it was shown that the buckling load can be improved by about 40% 
by only 50% of the total plies considered for fiber steering. An elliptical 
cylinder was also studied for axial buckling improvement and the results 
showed that its buckling capacity can potentially be improved by up to 
104% over its constant stiffness (CS) and 144% over its quasi-isotropic 
(QI) counterparts.

 CHAPTER 15 
Manufacturing Challenges Associated with the 
Use of Metal Matrix Composites in Aerospace 
Structures 
Tracie Prater*

Abstract: Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) are materials which consist of a 
metal alloy reinforced with ceramic particles or fibers. These materials possess a 
very high strength to weight ratio, good resistance to impact and wear, and a 
number of other properties which make them attractive for use in aerospace and 
defense applications. For example, MMCs have being extensively used for 
structural tubing in the space shuttle orbiter, the antenna mast of the Hubble Space 
Telescope, control surfaces and propulsion systems for aircraft, and tank armors. 
However, difficulties arise when joining those materials with fusion welding and 
impose limitations on the size of MMC components. Melting of the material leads 
to formation of an undesirable phase when molten Aluminum (Al) comes into 
contact and reacts with the reinforcement. This phase forms a strength depleted 
zone along the jointline. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively joining 
technique, developed at The Welding Institute (TWI) in 1991. Because FSW occurs 
below the melting temperature of many metal alloys, it precludes formation of 
deleterious phases and results in a more favorable welded microstructure that is 
closer to that of the parent material.  At NASA, this process was first applied to 
weld  the super lightweight external tank for the  space shuttles program. Today

FSW is employed to join structural components in Delta IV, Atlas V, and Falcon IX 
rockets as well as NASA’s Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and Space Launch 
System. Currently, FSW researchers are interested in extending the application of 
the process to new materials which are difficult to weld using conventional fusion 
techniques, such as MMCs. Rapid wear of the welding tool in FSW of MMCs is a 
consequence of the large discrepancy in hardness between the steel tool and the 
reinforcement material. This chapter summarizes the challenges encountered when 
joining MMCs to themselves or to other materials in structures. Specific attention is 
paid to the influence of the process variables for FSW on the wear process. A 
phenomenological model of the wear process was established based on the rotating 
plug model of FSW. The effectiveness of tool materials with high hardness (e.g. 
Tungsten Carbide, high speed steel, and tools with diamond coatings) in resisting 
abrasive wear is also considered. In-process force, torque, and vibration signals are 
analyzed to determine the feasibility of in situ monitoring of tool shape changes as 
a result of wear. One advantage of this model is that its successful implementation 
would eliminate the need for off-line evaluation of tool condition during joining. 
Monitoring, controlling, and reducing tool wear in FSW of MMCs are critical to 
full application of these materials in aerospace structures where they would be of 
most benefit. The work presented in this chapter can be further extended for 
machining of MMCs, where the wear of the tool materials is also a limiting factor.

INTRODUCTION 
The reliance on ballistic techniques in launch architectures makes mini- 
mization of weight one of the most preeminent issues in spacecraft design. 
For any launch vehicle, cargo weights only comprise a small portion of 
the vehicle’s weight at launch. Structural components and fuel account for 
the vast majority of the launch weight of a rocket. In order to improve the 
structural efficiency of a vehicle, the vehicle’s dry weight can be reduced 
and the weight reduction represents a commensurate gain in cargo 
capacity.  
 
Use of lighter weight materials represent one option for reducing a 
vehicle’s weight. At present, Aluminum alloys are used as the primary 
aerospace structural material for fuel tanks. These alloys are lightweight, 
strong, well-characterized, and abundant. However, recent development 
of advanced materials such as composites have made it possible to further 
reduce the weight of the structure while satisfying (and in many cases 

Metal Matrix Composites in Aerospace Structures            Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1  545 
 
exceeding) the mechanical criteria established for flight-rated hardware. 
In 2001, NASA changed the material of the space shuttle’s external tank 
from Al 2219 to an aluminum- lithium composite (Al-Li 2195) developed 
by Lockheed Martin. This replacement reduced the total weight of the 
external tank by 7,500 pounds [1]. The weight reduction enabled the 
space shuttle to transport heavier components of the International Space 
Station and gave NASA the option to consolidate multiple large-scale 
components into a single flight, improving launch efficiency and 
imparting cost savings. Use of traditional fusion welding techniques to 
join composite material together resulted in mechanically deficient joints. 
Friction Stir Welding (FSW), a solid-state joining technique first proposed 
by The Welding Institute (TWI) of Great Britain, was able create 
defect-free Al-Li 2195 joints with superior mechanical properties. The 
Friction Stir Welding process is illustrated in Fig. (1). With the success of 
the external tank program, NASA revolutionized much of its manu- 
facturing by implementing the FSW process. The primary structures for 
NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion Crew Exploration 
Vehicle (CEV) rely extensively on the process to produce reliable, defect 
free joints. 
 
 
 
Fig. (1). The FSW process. The tool consists of a cylindrical pin that penetrates the workpiece 
material and a larger diameter shoulder which rests on the surface of the material. In the FSW 
process, the tool rotates at an angular speed 𝜔 while advancing through the material at a traverse 
speed v. During its traversal, plasticized material is picked up on its advancing side and is 
deposited on its retreating side.  Materials cools and consolidates to form a welded region.  

546  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Tracie Prater 
 
Driven by a continuing desire for lighter materials in the space industry, 
advanced material processing and aerospace welding techniques have 
progressed significantly in the past twenty years. As FSW is a mature 
technology for processing many aerospace Aluminum alloys (such as the 
2000, 6000, and 7000 series), there is a considerable interest to extend the 
application of FSW to other, higher temperature materials, such as steels, 
Magnesium alloys, and even Titanium. A group of materials which are 
especially suitable for FSW are metal matrix composites (MMCs). MMCs 
are dual phase materials which consist of a ceramic reinforcement 
embedded in a matrix of metal alloy. Typical reinforcements are ceramics 
such as silicon carbide or aluminum oxide in the form of either particulates 
or fibers. The amount of the reinforcement material in a MMC is 
represented as a percentage of the MMC’s overall weight or volume. Metal 
composites are superior to their unreinforced counterparts in terms of 
strength to weight ratio (which may be more than twice of that of the 
conventional Aluminum alloys), excellent temperature and wear resistance, 
and long fatigue life. Unfortunately, the joints of these materials created 
using fusion welding display a considerable amount of micro-pores and 
cracks [2]. The mechanical properties of these fusion welded such joints are 
negatively impacted by the presence of Al4C3, an undesirable precipitate 
produced during the reaction of molten Aluminum with the reinforcement 
[3]. Since FSW occurs below the melting point of the matrix alloy, the 
deleterious theta phase is absent in the FSW welds of these materials. The 
major barrier to the application of FSW in joining of MMCs is rapid and 
severe wear of the tool, a consequence of direct contact between the tool 
(typically fabricated from a steel alloy) and the comparatively harder 
reinforcement particles [3]. Progressive wear of the tool removes features 
which facilitate material stirring and thus increases the likelihood of void 
development [4].

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
 
Large defects present in the weld result in reduced mechanical properties. 
For MMCs, it is therefore critical to reduce wear and preserve the tool shape 
that will facilitate material stirring and prevent the formation of such 
defects. To avoid weld-related structural failures, significant investments 
have been made by NASA and its commercial partners on post-process 
inspection and non-destructive testing techniques (such as ultrasonics and 
X-rays) to inspect welds of flight hardware. The non-destructive evaluation 
results and mechanical tests require parameterization studies. As part of 
weld development, a set of experiments is designed to determine a window 
of welding parameters that can produce joints satisfying design and safety 
criteria. Even though many parameterization studies about FSW of MMCs 
have demonstrated that it is possible to generate an acceptable operating 
window of parameters for virtually any tool/workpiece combination, these 
studies did not specifically consider defects resulting from the wear 
mechanisms that affect the system [5, 6]. Even if parameters used to 
produce the MMC joint fall in the operating window, there is still a 
possibility that a defect may be created over time as the tool loses volume 
and the workpiece undergoes a corresponding reduction in the flow of 
plasticized material. Therefore a better control of the wear process during 
joining is required to fully guarantee the successful integration of MMCs 
into aerospace structures. Measures of mitigating wear may include careful 
selection of process parameters (rotation speed, traverse rate, length of weld, 
tilt angle, etc.) and material properties (percentage reinforcement, type of 
reinforcement, particle size, and tool material). In cases of longer welds or 
scenarios in which coatings fail to guard against wear, wear maybe 
inevitable and in-process monitoring becomes essential. As emphasized in 
the previous discussion, in process wear detection is often synonymous 
with in-process fault detection due to the loss of tool features which 
facilitate material stirring. Techniques used to detect wear in this scenario 

548  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Tracie Prater 
 
may also be applied for in–process quality control of FSW of conventional 
alloys. 
 
RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN 
WEAR 
AND 
PROCESS 
PARAMETERS 
 
The first key to unraveling the tool wear problem in FSW of MMCs is to 
understand the fundamental physics which underlie the wear process. A 
study of the variation of wear with FSW process parameters can provide 
some initial insight. The experiments for the preliminary wear study 
conducted in this work comprise an L27 orthogonal Taguchi array with 
three factors (rotation rate 𝜔, traverse speed v, and distance welded l) at 
three levels (Table 1). The deterioration in the cross-sectional area of the 
tool pre and post-experiment was quantified using imaging software. Tool 
wear in FSW of MMCs displays a circumferentially symmetric pattern, 
which means that the degradation measured in the cross-section of the 
probe is representative of the volume lost by the entire probe. Fig. (2) shows 
an overlay of close-up images of the tool probe taken after successive welds 
of Al 359 reinforced with 20% Silicon Carbide particles. The characteristic 
rounding of the tool that accompanies wear is undesirable because it limits 
vertical stirring of material and frequently results in root flaw defects [4].

The wear data obtained from these experiments was used to construct a 
multiple regression model (MRM) to predict the volume loss of the tool in 
welding based on the values of the three major process parameters [7]. An 
analog can be drawn between the MRM model and the machinability maps 
used to determine optimal parameters for machining abrasive materials.  In 
both instances, we seek to develop parameters which minimize wear but 
still produce a cut, hole or other feature (ex. weld) with acceptable quality. 
The relationship derived from the regression analysis (Eq. 1) is strongly 
correlated with the experimental data. The empirical predictive model was 
tested on a validation set that consists of cases separate from those in the 
original data set used to construct the regression model. The calculated and 
observed wear values for the validation set closely agree with each other. A 
direct comparison of observed and calculated values is presented in Table 2. 
The model should thus be applicable to parameter sets different from those 
used in its construction.

From the multivariate regression analysis results it can be seen that tool 
wear in FSW of MMCs is directly proportional to the rotation speed and 
welding distance but inversely proportional to the traverse speed. A 
dimensionless group (𝜔𝑙/𝑣) is defined based on these parameters, which is 
linearly correlated with wear as expressed in Eq. 2. Physically, Eq. (2) 
means that each unit increase in the group 𝜔ℓ/𝜈 is accompanied by 
a .0004% increase in wear [8]. This constant, like the constants in the 
multiple regression model (Eq. 1), can be used to predict relative changes in 
wear based on changes in process parameters. For instance, a 10,000-fold 
increase in 𝜔ℓ/𝜈 would be associated with a 4% increase in wear 
percentage.

The regression equation and the companion dimensionless group are 
intended to inform parameter selection in FSW of MMCs. If the length of 
weld and the critical value of tool degradation are given, the dimensionless 
group (or the regression model) can be employed to define combinations of 
rotation and traverse speed that will keep the wear below a specified level. 
Similarly, the equations can be used to estimate the life of a steel tool in 
joining MMCs and decide the maximum distance which can be welded at a 
specific set of process parameters before wear increases beyond an 
acceptable level. 
 
CONSTRUCTING AN ANALYTICAL MODEL OF THE WEAR 
PROCESS 
 
The wear process in FSW of MMCs is unique in that it appears to be a shear, 
(rather than drag) phenomena, as suggested by the inverse relationship 
between the wear and the traverse speed. To date, no analytical model has 
been developed to describe how wear varies along the length of the pin tool. 
Based on experimental observation, most material loss occurs in the zone of 

552  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Tracie Prater 
 
the probe tip while the material loss at the interface between the probe and 
the shoulder is minimal. The rotating plug model for material flow in FSW, 
originally developed by Dr. Arthur Nunes of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight 
Center, provides a framework for understanding the physical phenomena 
which govern the relationships observed experimentally in FSW of MMCs 
[9]. In this formulation, it is assumed that the probe is surrounded by a plug 
of plasticized metal, also referred to as the “rotating plug”. The width of this 
plug, δ, can be considered as a function of the process parameters ω and ν, 
and the angular position θ in the x-y plane (Eq. 3). As shown in Figs. (3 and 
4), the plug is symmetric about the y-axis and changes from δ= 𝛿0 at       
θ = -π/2 to δ 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 at θ = π/2.

The analytical model can be slightly adjusted to account for the presence of 
abrasive particles like the inclusions found in Al-MMCs. The model as it 
applies to FSW of MMCs is shown in Fig. (4). For a given particle diameter

D, wear occurs only when the particle is able to span the width of the shear 
zone and impinge on the tool surface, removing material as the tool rotates 
past it. The analytical results calculated based this model are consistent with 
the experimental data. Greater wear is produced by parameters which 
correspond to thinner shear zones, while parameter sets associated with 
larger δ values lead to less wear [9]. A piecewise condition for abrasion is 
also suggested by the rotating plug model: wear only occurs at locations 
where the radius of the particle exceeds the width of the shear zone 
(𝐷/2 > 𝛿). This corollary implies that the wear is also influenced by 
material properties, such as particle size and percentage of reinforcement 
(number density of particles present in the material).

thickness 𝛿). The solid black circle depicts an abrasive particle in the workpiece material. 
 
The rotating plug model presented in this chapter can be used to define the 
region where scoring of the tool by abrasive is possible. The original plug 
model predicts that the shear surface widens along the length of the tool 
(Fig. 5), making the region near the tip of the probe the most susceptible to 

554  Frontiers in Aerospace Science, Vol. 1                                         Tracie Prater 
 
abrasion. The percent wear predicted by the model can be calculated with 
equation 4, where D is the diameter of the reinforcement particle, P denotes 
the proportion of reinforcement relative to the volume of the entire 
workpiece, 𝜔 is the rotation speed, 𝑣 is the traverse speed, l is the length of 
weld, R is the radius of the pin, and ∆𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑥 represents the maximum value of 
the cutting arc (an angular area where the abrasion can occur). For a 
detailed derivation of this equation please refer to references [9] and [10]. It 
is assumed that the depth to which the particle impinges on the tool surface 
is equal to the radius of the particle. The volume of material removed in a 
single rotation is integrated along the length of the tool where abrasion may 
occur. That length is estimated at about half of the probe length. The 
deterioration in the width of the cutting arc ∆𝐶 as the distance from the 
probe increases is also considered. Analytical results calculated using this 
model are close (generally within 10 percent) to values measured in 
experiments, with differences between predicted and observed values     
[9, 10].

Colligan [11] conducted tracer experiments to study material flow in FSW.  
In this work, steel shot tracers were embedded along the joint line and 
welded joints were subsequently X-rayed. An analogous technique, 
wherein SiC particulate was inserted in a milled slot along the advancing 
face of an Aluminum 6061 joint and subsequently friction stir welded, was 
used to isolate the impact of particle size on tool wear in this application 
and further evaluate the predictions of the rotating plug model. The wear of 
the tool probe was evaluated after welding by means of weighing, contact 
profilometry, and SEM microscopy. As we would expect intuitively and as 
predicted by the plug model, the amount of wear is strongly dependent on 
the particle size. The percent weight lost by the tool during welding as a 
function of the inclusion particle size is plotted in Fig. (6).

Surface metrology of FSW tool probes used for welding joints containing 
particles of three different sizes (FEPA grade F150, F60, and F14) were 
compared using contact profilometry. Surface texture parameters such as 
the average roughness Ra and peak to valley roughness Rt dramatically

change with the wear. The linear increase in roughness (relative to the 
unworn probe) directly varies with the particle size [10]. It is generally 
expected that the larger the particles, the greater the observed wear. The 
experimental results of the particle size experiments suggest the following: 
 
1. They provide further evidence for the rotating plug model of wear, 
suggesting that wear in this process is strongly dependent on 
particle size. Within the context of the model, larger particles are 
more likely to span the clearance 𝛿 between the probe and the 
rotating plug and impinge on the tool surface. 
2. From the perspective of material design, the experimental results 
demonstrate that one technique to minimize wear in FSW of MMCs 
is to select materials with reinforcement particles lying at the upper 
end of the FEPA scale.  
3. The experimental method adapted based on Colligan’s approach 
represents an economical means to study the effect of materials with 
specific particle sizes for research purposes that does not require the 
production of custom material.

COMBATTING WEAR: SELECTION OF TOOL MATERIALS 
 
The tools used in the particle tracer experiments were further inspected 
using SEM to evaluate the abrasive wear mechanism (Fig. 7). The best way 
to prevent wear in this instance is to select a tool material that is harder than 
the reinforcement particles. According to classical wear theory, when the 
hardness ratio between the tool and the abrasive is greater than one, 
abrasive wear cannot occur. The best candidate for a wear-resistant tool 
material is diamond. However, monolithic diamond is typically only used 
in critical manufacturing applications because of its high cost. Diamond 
coatings represent a cost effective alternative. The major barrier to 
application of coated tools in FSW is the coating’s tendency to delaminate 
under the stresses imposed by the joining process. When delamination 
occurs, the wear behavior of the coated tool regresses to levels associated 
with its substrate. Hence a strong bond between substrate and coating is 
necessary 
to 
prevent 
delamination 
and 
preserve 
wear-resistant 
characteristics of the coated tool. The effect of the hardness ratio on wear in 
FSW of MMCs was evaluated using four different tool materials (O1 tool 
steel, WC, WC micrograin, and WC coated with diamond) in two substrate 
materials (Al 359/SiC/20p and Al 359/SiC/30p) at the previously optimized 
parameter set 𝜔 = 1000 RPM and 𝑣 = 3 IPM (the brittle behavior of ceramic 
and refractory metals significantly narrows the process window for FSW). 
A higher rotation rate coupled with a comparatively slower traverse speed 
tends to provide sufficient heating to reduce the of tool failure. Fig. (8) 
compares the cumulative wear of the candidate materials over a 4 feet of 
length of weld. The wear resistance of the coated tool is the best of the 
materials considered but the margin between the performance of the 
diamond and WC-Co probes is small [12].

represents the wear percentage measured for the tool material after three 14” long welds (at 1000 
RPM/3 IPM) in an Al 359 MMC with either 20% or 30% SiC reinforcement [12]. 
 
IN SITU SENSING OF WEAR USING TORQUE 
 
An inspection of the torque equation derived from the rotating plug model 
(equation 5) indicates that radial deterioration of the probe during joining of 
MMCs by FSW should coincide with a decrease in the magnitude of the 
torque the tool experiences during welding. Simulations carried out by 
Gibson, Prater, et al. showed that in situ estimates of wear could be made 
with an adaptive torque controller [13]. According to Nunes’s torque 
equation developed based on the rotating plug model, the torque signal is 
sensitive to flow stress 𝜎, temperature, plunge depth t, as well as geometric 
parameters (shoulder and pin radii R and r, respectively). These additional 
(and sometimes coupled) relationships make it more difficult to isolate 
changes in the torque signal that can be attributed solely to radial loss of 
tool material. Nonetheless, in-process sensing merits further investigation 
since such a capability would minimize disruption of the manufacturing 
process for wear evaluation (currently tools must be taken off-line to assess

wear) and in some cases be tantamount to flaw detection. Fig. (9) depicts 
the evolution of the torque signal (measured from motor current) over a 6ft 
weld of Al 359/SiC/20p for a conventional tool material (O1 steel hardened 
to RC 50). The steady-state torque signal for each pass was related to the 
amount of wear. Over the course of several experiments where longer 
panels are welded, the results demonstrated the change in torque signal due 
to wear is both detectable and a viable technique for wear prediction. One 
primary application of such wear detecting technology would be longer 
length welds of reinforced Al alloys where an off-line in media res 
evaluation of wear is not feasible.

CONCLUSION 
 
The ultimate goal of the present study is to extend the application of metal 
composites to aerospace structures by developing process models and

techniques to mitigate wear. MMCs have a broad spectrum of properties 
which make them good candidate materials for aerospace applications. 
Properties such as strength, fatigue life, and wear resistance for MMCs are 
superior to conventional, unreinforced Aluminum alloys. In addition, 
MMCs are customizable: the composition of an MMC (the matrix alloy, the 
reinforcement material, and the percent in which this reinforcement is 
present) can be optimized to produce a material with desired mechanical 
properties. While an MMC has approximately the same weight as an 
unreinforced Aluminum alloy, its higher strength can significantly decrease 
the amount of material required for a specific design. Weldability and 
machinability remains the primary obstacle to full application of MMCs in 
aerospace structures. The work presented in this chapter achieves a 
fundamental understanding of this wear process and provides a base of 
knowledge for controlling, sensing and mitigating wear in FSW of MMCs. 
 
Despite its impact on joining metal composites and other high-strength 
alloys, to date tool wear in FSW has not been the subject of many focused 
investigations. This study presents a starting point for understanding wear 
phenomena in this application. The significances of this work include: 1) 
identification of the wear mechanism; 2) development of empirical models 
that predict the extent of tool wear based on process parameters and 
material properties; 3) advancement of tool materials and coatings to 
prevent and/or mitigate wear; and 4) evaluation of the feasibility of sensing 
techniques which can provide more information about the condition of the 
tool in-process. The collective results of these studies provide an informed 
strategy for material selection of both tool and workpiece materials to 
minimize tool wear. A combination of careful material selection, control of 
process parameters, and monitoring of torque and other process signals that 
correlate with wear can potentially reduce volume loss to a degree that 
enables the production of defect free welds. The development of a 
fundamental understanding of wear phenomena in FSW is necessary and 
essential for control and mitigation of wear processes and stands to 
accelerate implementation of these materials in aerospace industry
