About the Author
Doug Lowe has written enough computer books to line all the birdcages in 
California. His other books include Networking All-in-One Desk Reference For 
Dummies (now in its fourth edition), PowerPoint 2013 For Dummies, Java All-
in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, and Electronics All-in-One For Dummies.
Although Doug has yet to win a Pulitzer Prize, he remains cautiously optimis­
tic. He is hopeful that Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil will turn 
this book into a musical, titled Les Réseau Miserables. (Hopefully the role of 
the vengeful network administrator will be played by someone who can sing.)
Doug lives in sunny Fresno, California, where the nearby Sierra Nevada moun­
tains are visible through the smog at least three or four glorious days every 
year.


Dedication
This one is for mom. I will miss you so.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank project editor Christopher Morris, who did a great job of 
managing all the editorial work that was required to put this book together, 
and Amy Fandrei, who made the whole project possible. I’d also like to 
thank Dan DiNicolo, who gave the entire manuscript a thorough technical 
review and offered many excellent suggestions, as well as copy editor Teresa 
Artman, who made sure the i’s were crossed and the t’s were dotted (oops, 
reverse that!). And, as always, thanks to all the behind-the-scenes people who 
chipped in with help I’m not even aware of.

Introduction
W

elcome to the tenth edition of Networking For Dummies, the book 
that’s written especially for people who have this nagging feeling in 
the back of their minds that they should network their computers but haven’t 
a clue about how to start or where to begin.
Do you often copy a spreadsheet to a flash drive just so you can give it to 
someone else in your office? Are you frustrated because you can’t use the 
fancy color laser printer that’s on the financial secretary’s computer? Do you 
wait in line to use the computer that has the customer database? You need a 
network!
Or maybe you already have a network, but you have just one problem: 
Someone promised that a network would make your life easier, but it’s 
instead turned your computing life upside down. Just when you had this 
computer thing figured out, someone popped into your office, hooked up a 
cable, and said, “Happy networking!” Makes you want to scream.
Regardless, you’ve found the right book. Help is here, within these humble 
pages.
This book talks about networks in everyday (and often irreverent) terms. The 
language is friendly; you don’t need a graduate education to get through it. 
And the occasional potshot helps unseat the hallowed and sacred traditions 
of networkdom, bringing just a bit of fun to an otherwise dry subject. The 
goal is to bring the lofty precepts of networking down to earth, where you can 
touch them and squeeze them and say, “What’s the big deal? I can do this!”
About This Book
This isn’t the kind of book you pick up and read from start to finish, as if it 
were a cheap novel. If I ever see you reading it at the beach, I’ll kick sand in 
your face. This book is more like a reference, the kind of book you can pick up, 
turn to just about any page, and start reading. Each chapter covers a specific 
aspect of networking, such as printing from the network, hooking up network 
cables, or setting up security so that bad guys can’t break in. Just turn to the 
chapter you’re interested in and start reading.

2
Networking For Dummies, 10th Edition 
Each chapter is divided into self-contained chunks, all related to the major 
theme of the chapter. For example, the chapter on hooking up the network 
cable contains nuggets like these:
	
✓	What is Ethernet?
	
✓	All about cable
	
✓	To shield or not to shield
	
✓	Wall jacks and patch panels
	
✓	Switches
You don’t have to memorize anything in this book. It’s a need-to-know 
book: You pick it up when you need to know something. Need to know what 
100BaseT is? Pick up the book. Need to know how to create good passwords? 
Pick up the book. Otherwise, put it down and get on with your life.
How to Use This Book
This book works like a reference. Start with the topic you want to find out 
about. Look for it in the Table of Contents or in the index to get going. 
If you need to type something, you see the text you need to type like this: 
Type this stuff. In this example, you type Type this stuff at the keyboard and 
then press Enter. An explanation usually follows, just in case you’re scratching 
your head and grunting, “Huh?”
Whenever I describe a message or information that you see on the screen, I 
present it this way:
A message from your friendly network
This book rarely directs you elsewhere for information; just about everything 
that you need to know about networks is right here. If you find the need for 
additional information, plenty of other For Dummies books can help. If you 
have a networking question that isn’t covered in this book, allow me to sug­
gest my own Networking All-in-One For Dummies, 5th Edition (Wiley), which 
is a much-expanded reference book that goes deeper into specific network 
operating systems and TCP/IP protocols. You can also find plenty of other 
For Dummies books that cover just about every operating system and appli­
cation program known to humanity.

 Introduction
What You Don’t Need to Read
Aside from the topics you can use right away, much of this book is skippable. 
I carefully placed extra-technical information in self-contained sidebars and 
clearly marked them so that you can steer clear of them. Don’t read this stuff 
unless you’re really into technical explanations and want to know a little of 
what’s going on behind the scenes. Don’t worry: My feelings won’t be hurt if 
you don’t read every word.
Foolish Assumptions
I’m making only two assumptions about who you are: You’re someone who 
works with a PC, and you either have a network or you’re thinking about get­
ting one. I hope that you know (and are on speaking terms with) someone 
who knows more about computers than you do. My goal is to decrease your 
reliance on that person, but don’t throw away his phone number yet.
Is this book useful for Macintosh users? Absolutely. Although the bulk of this 
book is devoted to showing you how to link Windows-based computers to 
form a network, you can find information about how to network Macintosh 
computers as well.
Windows 8? Gotcha covered. You’ll find plenty of information about how to 
network with the latest and greatest Microsoft operating system.
How This Book Is Organized
Inside this book, you find chapters arranged in parts. Each chapter breaks 
down into sections that cover various aspects of the chapter’s main subject. 
The chapters are in a logical sequence, so reading them in order (if you want 
to read the whole thing) makes sense, but the book is modular enough that 
you can pick it up and start reading at any point.
Here’s the lowdown on what’s in each part.
Part I: Getting Started with Networking
The chapters in this part present a layperson’s introduction to what networking 
is all about. This part is a good place to start if you’re clueless about what 

4
Networking For Dummies, 10th Edition 
a network is and why you’re suddenly expected to use one. It’s also a great 
place to start if you’re a hapless network user who doesn’t give a whit about 
“optimizing network performance” but wants to know what the network is 
and how to get the most out of it.
The best thing about this part is that it focuses on how to use a network with­
out getting into the technical details of setting up a network or maintaining a 
network server. In other words, this part is aimed at ordinary network users 
who have to know how to get along with a network.
Part II: Setting Up a Network
Uh-oh. The boss just gave you an ultimatum: Get a network up and running 
by Friday or pack your things. The chapters in this section cover everything 
you need to know to build a network, from picking the network operating 
system to installing the cable.
Part III: Working with Servers
One of the most challenging aspects of setting up a network is installing and 
configuring server computers and the software that runs on them. The chap­
ters in this part show you how to set up a basic server, create user accounts, 
and configure file, e-mail, and web servers.
Part IV: Cloudy with a 
Chance of Gigabytes
The chapters in this part introduce you to techniques for extending your net­
work into the Internet using what has come to be known as cloud computing. 
Included in this part are chapters about integrating the new breed of mobile 
devices such as smartphones and tablet computers into your network, as 
well as extending your office network to your home computer.
Part V: Managing and Protecting 
Your Network
I hope that the job of managing the network doesn’t fall on your shoulders, 
but in case it does, the chapters in this part can help you out. You find out all 
about backup, security, performance, dusting, mopping, changing the oil, and 
all the other stuff that network managers have to do.

5
 Introduction
You will also learn about network security: backing up your data, protecting 
your network from evil people who want to break your network’s back, and 
hardening your network against threats such as viruses and spyware.
Part VI: More Ways to Network
The three chapters in this part cover some additional technologies you need 
to know to build and manage a successful network. First, you’ll see how you 
can use virtualization in your network so that you can save money by buying 
fewer server computers. Then you’ll discover about networking with the two 
most popular alternatives to Windows: Linux and Macintosh computers.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
This wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without a collection of lists of interest­
ing snippets: ten networking commandments, ten things you should keep in 
your closet, and more!
Icons Used in This Book
Those nifty little pictures in the margin aren’t there just to pretty up the

omputer networks get a bad rap in the movies. In the classic Terminator 
movies, Skynet (a computer network of the future) takes over the planet, 
builds deadly terminator robots, and sends them back through time to kill 
everyone unfortunate enough to have the name Sarah Connor. In the Matrix 
movies, a vast and powerful computer network enslaves humans and keeps 
them trapped in a simulation of the real world. And in Eagle Eye, Shia LaBeouf 
is chased around the country by a deranged supercomputer that has control 
of every imaginable networkable device, including traffic signals, mobile 
phones, and fast-food menus.
Fear not. These bad networks exist only in the dreams of science fiction writers. 
Real-world networks are much more calm and predictable. They don’t think 
for themselves, they can’t evolve into something you don’t want them to be, 
and they won’t hurt you, even if your name is Sarah Connor.
Now that you’re over your fear of networks, you’re ready to breeze through 
this chapter. It’s a gentle, even superficial, introduction to computer networks, 
with a slant toward the concepts that can help you use a computer that’s 
attached to a network. This chapter goes easy on the details; the detailed and 
boring stuff comes later.

10
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
Defining a Network
A network is nothing more than two or more computers connected by a cable 
or by a wireless radio connection so that they can exchange information.
Of course, computers can exchange information in ways other than networks. 
Most of us have used what computer nerds call the sneakernet. That’s where 
you copy a file to a flash drive (or a CD or DVD) and then walk the data over 
to someone else’s computer. (The term sneakernet is typical of computer 
nerds’ feeble attempts at humor.)
The whole problem with the sneakernet is that it’s slow, and it wears a trail in 
your carpet. One day, some penny-pinching computer geeks discovered that 
connecting computers with cables was cheaper than replacing the carpet 
every six months. Thus, the modern computer network was born.
You can create a simple computer network by hooking together all the com­
puters in your office with cables and using the computer’s network interface 
(an electronic circuit that resides inside your computer and has a special 
jack on the computer’s backside). Then you tweak a few simple settings in 
the computer’s operating system (OS) software, and voilà! You have a work­
ing network. That’s all there is to it.
If you don’t want to mess with cables, you can create a wireless network 
instead. In a wireless network, the computers use wireless network adapt­
ers that communicate via radio signals. All modern laptop computers have 
built-in wireless network adapters. To create a wireless network with a desk­
top computer, though, you’ll need to purchase a separate wireless network 
adapter that plugs into one of the computer’s USB ports.
Figure 1-1 shows a typical network with four computers. You can see that 
all four computers are connected by a network cable to a central network 
device: the switch. You can also see that Ward’s computer has a fancy laser 
printer attached to it. Because of the network, June, Wally, and the Beaver can 
also use this laser printer. (Also, you can see that the Beaver stuck yesterday’s 
bubble gum to the back of his computer. Although the bubble gum isn’t 
recommended, it shouldn’t adversely affect the network.)

Computer networking has its own strange vocabulary. Although you don’t 
have to know every esoteric networking term, it helps to be acquainted with 
a few of the basic buzzwords:
	
✓	LAN: Networks are often called LANs, short for local area network.
	
	LAN is the first TLA — or three-letter acronym — of this book. You don’t 
really need to remember it or any of the many TLAs that follow. In fact, 
the only three-letter acronym you need to remember is TLA. You might 
guess that the acronym for four-letter acronym is FLA. Wrong! A four-letter 
acronym is an ETLA, which stands for extended three-letter acronym. 
After all, it just wouldn’t be right if the acronym for four-letter acronym 
had only three letters.
	
✓	On the network: Every computer connected to the network is said to 
be “on the network.” The technical term (which you can forget) for a 
computer that’s on the network is a node.
	
✓	Online, offline: When a computer is turned on and can access the network, 
the computer is online. When a computer can’t access the network, it’s 
offline. A computer can be offline for several reasons. The computer can 
be turned off, the user may have disabled the network connection, the 
computer may be broken, the cable that connects it to the network can 
be unplugged, or a wad of gum can be jammed into the disk drive.
	
✓	Up, down: When a computer is turned on and working properly, it’s 
up. When a computer is turned off, broken, or being serviced, it’s down. 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
Turning off a computer is sometimes called taking it down. Turning it 
back on is sometimes called bringing it up.
	
✓	Local, remote: A resource such as a disk drive is local if it resides in 
your computer. It’s remote if it resides in another computer somewhere 
else on your network.
	
✓	Internet: The Internet is a huge amalgamation of computer networks 
strewn about the entire planet. Networking the computers in your home 
or office so that they can share information with one another and con­
necting your computer to the worldwide Internet are two separate but 
related tasks.
Why Bother with a Network?
Frankly, computer networks are a bit of a pain to set up. So why bother? Because 
the benefits of having a network outweigh the difficulties of setting up one.
You don’t have to be a PhD to understand the benefits of networking. In fact, 
you learned everything you need to know in kindergarten: Networks are all 
about sharing. Specifically, networks are about sharing three things: files, 
resources, and programs.
Sharing files
Networks enable you to share information with other computers on the net­
work. Depending on how you set up your network, you can share files with 
your network friends in several different ways. You can send a file from your 
computer directly to a friend’s computer by attaching the file to an e-mail 
message and then mailing it. Or you can let your friend access your com­
puter over the network so that your friend can retrieve the file directly from 
your hard drive. Yet another method is to copy the file to a disk on another 
computer and then tell your friend where you put the file so that your friend 
can retrieve it later. One way or the other, the data travels to your friend’s 
computer over the network cable and not on a CD or DVD or flash drive, as it 
would in a sneakernet.
Sharing resources
You can set up certain computer resources — such as hard drives or printers — 
so that all computers on the network can access them. For example, the laser 
printer attached to Ward’s computer in Figure 1-1 is a shared resource, which 
means that anyone on the network can use it. Without the network, June, 
Wally, and the Beaver would have to buy their own laser printers.

13
 Chapter 1: Let’s Network!
Hard drives can be shared resources, too. In fact, you must set up a hard 
drive as a shared resource to share files with other users. Suppose that Wally 
wants to share a file with the Beaver, and a shared hard drive has been set 
up on June’s computer. All Wally has to do is copy his file to the shared hard 
drive in June’s computer and tell the Beaver where he put it. Then, when the 
Beaver gets around to it, he can copy the file from June’s computer to his 
own (unless, of course, that hooligan Eddie Haskell deletes the file first).
	
You can share other resources, too, such as an Internet connection. In fact, 
sharing an Internet connection is one of the main reasons why many networks 
are created.
Sharing programs
Rather than keep separate copies of programs on each person’s computer, 
putting programs on a drive that everyone shares is sometimes best. For 
example, if ten computer users all use a particular program, you can pur­
chase and install ten copies of the program, one for each computer. Or you 
can purchase a ten-user license for the program and then install just one 
copy of the program on a shared drive. Each of the ten users can then access 
the program from the shared hard drive.
In most cases, however, running a shared copy of a program over the network 
is unacceptably slow. A more common way of using a network to share pro­
grams is to copy the program’s installation disks or CDs to a shared network 
drive. Then you can use that copy to install a separate copy of the program on 
each user’s local hard drive. For example, Microsoft Office enables you to do 
this if you purchase a license from Microsoft for each computer on which you 
install Office.
The advantage of installing Office from a shared network drive is that you don’t 
have to lug around the installation disks or CDs to each user’s computer. And 
the system administrator can customize the network installation so that the 
software is installed the same way on each user’s computer. (However, these 
benefits are significant only for larger networks. If your network has fewer 
than about ten computers, you’re probably better off installing the program 
separately on each computer directly from the installation disks or CDs.)
	
Remember that purchasing a single-user copy of a program and then putting it 
on a shared network drive — so that everyone on the network can access it — 
is illegal. If five people use the program, you need to either purchase five copies 
of the program or purchase a network license that specifically allows five or 
more users.
	
That being said, many software manufacturers sell their software with a con­
current usage license, which means that you can install the software on as 
many computers as you want, but only a certain number of people can use 
the software at any given time. Usually, special licensing software that runs on 

14
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
one of the network’s server computers keeps track of how many people are 
currently using the software. This type of license is frequently used with more 
specialized (and expensive) software, such as accounting systems or com­
puter drafting systems.
Another benefit of networking is that networks enable computer users to 
communicate with one another over the network. The most obvious way 
networks allow computer users to communicate is by passing messages back 
and forth, using e-mail or instant-messaging programs. Networks also offer 
other ways to communicate: For example, you can hold online meetings over 
the network. Network users who have inexpensive video cameras (webcams) 
attached to their computers can have videoconferences. You can even play a 
friendly game of Hearts over a network — during your lunch break, of course.
Servers and Clients
The network computer that contains the hard drives, printers, and other 
resources that are shared with other network computers is a server. This 
term comes up repeatedly, so you have to remember it. Write it on the back 
of your left hand.
Any computer that’s not a server is a client. You have to remember this term, 
too. Write it on the back of your right hand.
Only two kinds of computers are on a network: servers and clients. Look at 
your left hand and then look at your right hand. Don’t wash your hands until 
you memorize these terms.
The distinction between servers and clients in a network has parallels in 
sociology — in effect, a sort of class distinction between the “haves” and 
“have-nots” of computer resources:
	
✓	Usually, the most powerful and expensive computers in a network are 
the servers. There’s a good technical reason: All users on the network 
share the server’s resources.
	
✓	The cheaper and less-powerful computers in a network are the clients. 
Clients are the computers used by individual users for everyday work. 
Because clients’ resources don’t have to be shared, they don’t have to 
be as fancy.
	
✓	Most networks have more clients than servers. For example, a network 
with ten clients can probably get by with one server.
	
✓	In many networks, a clean line of demarcation exists between servers 
and clients. In other words, a computer functions as either a server or 
a client, not both. For the sake of an efficient network, a server can’t 
become a client, nor can a client become a server.

15
 Chapter 1: Let’s Network!
	
✓	Other (usually smaller) networks can be more evenhanded by allowing 
any computer in the network to be a server and allowing any computer 
to be both server and client at the same time.
Dedicated Servers and Peers
In some networks, a server computer is a server computer and nothing else. 
It’s dedicated to the sole task of providing shared resources, such as hard 
drives and printers, to be accessed by the network client computers. This 
type of server is a dedicated server because it can perform no other task than 
network services.
Some smaller networks take an alternative approach by enabling any com­
puter on the network to function as both a client and a server. Thus, any 
computer can share its printers and hard drives with other computers on the 
network. And while a computer is working as a server, you can still use that 
same computer for other functions, such as word processing. This type of 
network is a peer-to-peer network because all the computers are thought of as 
peers, or equals.
Here are some points to ponder concerning the differences between dedi­
cated server networks and peer-to-peer networks while you’re walking the 
dog tomorrow morning:
	
✓	Peer-to-peer networking features are built into Windows. Thus, if your 
computer runs Windows, you don’t have to buy any additional software 
to turn your computer into a server. All you have to do is enable the 
Windows server features.
	
✓	The network server features that are built into desktop versions of 
Windows (such as Windows 7 and 8) aren’t particularly efficient because 
these versions of Windows weren’t designed primarily to be network 
servers.
	
	If you dedicate a computer to the task of being a full-time server, use a 
special network operating system rather than the standard Windows 
operating system. A network operating system (NOS) is specially 
designed to handle networking functions efficiently.
 
• The most commonly used NOSes are the server versions of Windows.
	
	As of this writing, the current server version of Windows is 
Windows Server 20012. However, many companies still use the 
previous version (Windows Server 2008), and a few even use its 
predecessor, Windows 2003 Server.
 
• Another popular NOS is Linux. Linux is popular because it is free. 
However, it requires a more expertise to set up than Windows Server.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
	
✓	Many networks are both peer-to-peer and dedicated-server networks at 
the same time. These networks have
 
• At least one server computer that runs an NOS, such as Windows 
Server 2012
 
• Client computers that use the server features of Windows to share 
their resources with the network
	
✓	Besides being dedicated, your servers should also be sincere.
What Makes a Network Tick?
To use a network, you don’t really have to know much about how it works. 
Still, you may feel a little bit better about using the network if you realize that 
it doesn’t work by voodoo. A network may seem like magic, but it isn’t. The 
following list describes the inner workings of a typical network:
	
✓	Network interface: Inside any computer attached to a network is a spe­
cial electronic circuit called the network interface. The network interface 
has either an external jack into which you can plug a network cable — 
or, in the case of a wireless network interface, an antenna.
	
✓	Network cable: The network cable physically connects the computers. It 
plugs into the network interface card (NIC) on the back of your computer.
	
	The type of network cable most commonly used is twisted-pair cable, so 
named because it consists of several pairs of wires twisted together in a 
certain way. Twisted-pair cable superficially resembles telephone cable. 
However, appearances can be deceiving. Most phone systems are wired 
using a lower grade of cable that doesn’t work for networks.
	
	For the complete lowdown on networking cables, see Chapter 6.
	
	Network cable isn’t necessary when wireless networking is used. For 
more information about wireless networking, see Chapter 9.
	
✓	Network switch: Networks built with twisted-pair cabling require one 
or more switches. A switch is a box with a bunch of cable connectors. 
Each computer on the network is connected by cable to the switch. The 
switch, in turn, connects all the computers to each other.
	
	In the early days of twisted-pair networking, devices known as hubs were 
used rather than switches. The term hub is sometimes used to refer to 
switches, but true hubs went out of style sometime around the turn of 
the century.
	
	In networks with just a few computers, the network switch is often com­
bined with another networking device called a router. A router is used to 
connect two networks. Typically, a router is used to connect your network 
to the Internet. By combining a router and a switch in a single box, you 
can easily connect several computers to the Internet and to each other. 

17
 Chapter 1: Let’s Network!
	
✓	Network software: Of course, the software makes the network work. 
To make any network work, a whole bunch of software has to be set up 
just right. For peer-to-peer networking with Windows, you have to play 
with the Control Panel to get networking to work. And an NOS such as 
Windows Server 2012 requires a substantial amount of tweaking to get it 
to work just right.
It’s Not a Personal Computer Anymore!
If I had to choose one point that I want you to remember from this chapter 
more than anything else, it’s this: After you hook up your personal computer 
(PC) to a network, it’s not a “personal” computer anymore. You’re now part 
of a network of computers, and in a way, you’ve given up one of the key con­
cepts that made PCs so successful in the first place: independence.
I got my start in computers back in the days when mainframe computers 
ruled the roost. Mainframe computers are big, complex machines that used to 
fill entire rooms and had to be cooled with chilled water. My first computer 
was a water-cooled Binford Hex Core Model 2000. Argh, argh, argh. (I’m not 
making up the part about the water. A plumber was often required to install a 
mainframe computer. In fact, the really big ones were cooled by liquid nitrogen. 
I am making up the part about the Binford 2000.)
Mainframe computers required staffs of programmers and operators in white 
lab coats just to keep them going. The mainframes had to be carefully managed. 
A whole bureaucracy grew up around managing them.
Mainframe computers used to be the dominant computers in the workplace. 
Personal computers changed all that: They took the computing power out 
of the big computer room and put it on the user’s desktop, where it belongs. 
PCs severed the tie to the centralized control of the mainframe computer. 
With a PC, a user could look at the computer and say, “This is mine — all 
mine!” Mainframes still exist, but they’re not nearly as popular as they once 
were.
But networks have changed everything all over again. In a way, it’s a change 
back to the mainframe-computer way of thinking: central location, distrib­
uted resources. True, the network isn’t housed in the basement and doesn’t 
have to be installed by a plumber. But you can no longer think of “your” PC 
as your own. You’re part of a network — and like the mainframe, the network 
has to be carefully managed.
Here are several ways in which a network robs you of your independence:
	
✓	You can’t just indiscriminately delete files from the network. They 
may not be yours.

18
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
	
✓	You’re forced to be concerned about network security. For example, a 
server computer has to know who you are before it allows you to access 
its files. So you have to know your user ID and password to access the 
network. This precaution prevents some 15-year-old kid from hacking 
his way into your office network by using its Internet connection and 
stealing all your computer games.
	
✓	You may have to wait for shared resources. Just because Wally sends 
something to Ward’s printer doesn’t mean that it immediately starts to 
print. The Beav may have sent a two-hour print job before that. Wally 
just has to wait.
	
✓	You may have to wait for access to documents. You may try to retrieve 
an Excel spreadsheet file from a network drive, only to discover that 
someone else is using it. Like Wally, you just have to wait.
	
✓	You don’t have unlimited storage space. If you copy a 100GB video file 
to a server’s drive, you may get calls later from angry co-workers com­
plaining that no room is left on the server’s drive for their important files.
	
✓	Your files can become infected from viruses given to you by someone 
over the network. You may then accidentally infect other network users.
	
✓	You have to be careful about saving sensitive files on the server. If you 
write an angry note about your boss and save it on the server’s hard 
drive, your boss may find the memo and read it.
	
✓	The server computer must be up and running at all times. For example, 
if you turn Ward’s computer into a server computer, Ward can’t turn his 
computer off when he’s out of the office. If he does, you can’t access the 
files stored on his computer.
	
✓	If your computer is a server, you can’t just turn it off when you’re 
finished using it. Someone else may be accessing a file on your hard 
drive or printing on your printer.
The Network Administrator
Because so much can go wrong — even with a simple network — designating 
one person as network administrator is important. This way, someone is 
responsible for making sure that the network doesn’t fall apart or get out of 
control.
The network administrator doesn’t have to be a technical genius. In fact, 
some of the best network administrators are complete idiots when it comes 
to technical stuff. What’s important is that the administrator is organized. 
That person’s job is to make sure that plenty of space is available on the file 

19
 Chapter 1: Let’s Network!
server, that the file server is backed up regularly, that new employees can 
access the network, among other tasks.
The network administrator’s job also includes solving basic problems that 
the users themselves can’t solve — and knowing when to call in an expert 
when something really bad happens. It’s a tough job, but somebody’s got to 
do it. Here are a few tips that might help:
	
✓	Part V of this book is devoted entirely to the hapless network adminis­
trator. So if you’re nominated, read the chapters in that part. If you’re 
lucky enough that someone else is nominated, celebrate by buying her a 
copy of this book.
	
✓	In small companies, picking the network administrator by drawing 
straws is common. The person who draws the shortest straw loses and 
becomes administrator.
	
✓	Of course, the network administrator can’t be a complete technical idiot. 
I was lying about that. (For those of you in Congress, the word is testify­
ing.) I exaggerated to make the point that organizational skills are more 
important than technical skills. The network administrator needs to 
know how to do various maintenance tasks. Although this knowledge 
requires at least a little technical know-how, the organizational skills are 
more important.
What Have They Got That You Don’t Got?
With all this technical stuff to worry about, you may begin to wonder whether 
you’re smart enough to use your computer after it’s attached to the network. 
Let me assure you that you are. If you’re smart enough to buy this book 
because you know that you need a network, you’re more than smart enough 
to use the network after it’s put in. You’re also smart enough to install and 
manage a network yourself. It isn’t rocket science.
I know people who use networks all the time. They’re no smarter than you 
are, but they do have one thing that you don’t have: a certificate. And so, 
by the powers vested in me by the International Society for the Computer 
Impaired, I present you with the certificate in Figure 1-2, confirming that 
you’ve earned the coveted title Certified Network Dummy, better known as 
CND. This title is considered much more prestigious in certain circles than 
the more stodgy CNE or MCSE badges worn by real network experts.
Congratulations, and go in peace.

fter you hook up your PC to a network, it’s not an island anymore, sepa­
rated from the rest of the world like some kind of isolationist fanatic 
waving a “Don’t tread on me” flag. The network connection changes your PC 
forever. Now your computer is part of a system, connected to other computers 
on the network. You have to worry about annoying network details, such as 
using local and shared resources, logging on and accessing network drives, 
using network printers, logging off, and who knows what else.
Oh, bother.
This chapter brings you up to speed on what living with a computer network 
is like. Unfortunately, this chapter gets a little technical at times, so you may 
need your pocket protector.
Distinguishing between Local Resources 
and Network Resources
In case you don’t catch this statement in Chapter 1, one of the most important 
differences between using an isolated computer and using a network com­
puter lies in the distinction between local resources and network resources. 
Local resources are items — such as hard drives, printers, and CD or DVD 

22
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
drives — that are connected directly to your computer. You can use 
local resources whether you’re connected to the network or not. Network 
resources, on the other hand, are the hard drives, printers, optical drives, and 
other devices that are connected to the network’s server computers. You can 
use network resources only after your computer is connected to the network.
Whenever you use a computer network, you need to know which resources 
are local resources (belong to you) and which are network resources (belong 
to the network). In most networks, your C: drive is a local drive, as is your My 
Documents folder. If a printer is sitting next to your PC, it’s probably a local 
printer. You can do anything you want with these resources without affecting 
the network or other users on the network (as long as the local resources 
aren’t shared on the network). Keep these points in mind:
	
✓	You can’t tell just by looking at a resource whether it’s a local resource 
or a network resource. The printer that sits right next to your com­
puter is probably your local printer, but then again, it may be a network 
printer. The same statement is true for hard drives: The hard drive in 
your PC is probably your own, but it (or part of it) may be shared on the 
network, thus enabling other users to access it.
	
✓	Because dedicated network servers are full of resources, you may say 
that they’re not only dedicated (and sincere), but also resourceful. 
(Groan. Sorry. This is yet another in a tireless series of bad computer-
nerd puns.)
What’s in a Name?
Just about everything on a computer network has a name: The computers 
themselves have names, the people who use the computers have names, the 
hard drives and printers that can be shared on the network have names, and 
the network itself has a name. Knowing all the names used on your network 
isn’t essential, but you do need to know some of them.
Here are some additional details about network names:
	
✓	Every person who can use the network has a username (sometimes 
called a user ID). You need to know your username to log on to the net­
work. You also need to know the usernames of your buddies, especially 
if you want to steal their files or send them nasty notes.
	
	You can find more information about usernames and logging on in the 
section “Logging On to the Network,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Letting folks on the network use their first names as their usernames 
is tempting but not a good idea. Even in a small office, you eventually 
run into a conflict. (And what about Mrs. McCave — made famous by Dr. 
Seuss — who had 23 children and named them all Dave?)

23
 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
	
	Create a consistent way of creating usernames. For example, you may 
use your first name plus the first two letters of your last name. Then 
Wally’s username is wallycl, and Beaver’s is beavercl. Or you may 
use the first letter of your first name followed by your complete last 
name. Then Wally’s username is wcleaver, and Beaver’s is bcleaver. 
(In most networks, capitalization doesn’t matter in usernames. Thus, 
bcleaver is the same as BCleaver.)
	
✓	Every computer on the network must have a unique computer name.
	
	You don’t have to know the names of all the computers on the network, 
but it helps if you know your own computer’s name and the names of 
any server computers you need to access.
	
	The computer’s name is sometimes the same as the username of the person 
who uses the computer, but that’s usually a bad idea because in many com­
panies, people come and go more often than computers. Sometimes the 
names indicate the physical location of the computer, such as office-12 
or back-room. Server computers often have names that reflect the group 
that uses the server most, like acctng-server or cad-server.
	
	Some network nerds like to assign techie-sounding names, like BL3K5-
87a. And some like to use names from science fiction movies; HAL, 
Colossus, M5, and Data come to mind. Cute names like Herbie aren’t 
allowed. (However, Tigger and Pooh are entirely acceptable — recom­
mended, in fact. Networks are what Tiggers like the best.)
	
	Usually, the sensible approach to computer naming is to use names that 
have numbers, such as computer001 or computer002.
	
✓	Network resources, such as shared disk folders and printers, have 
names. For example, a network server may have two printers, named 
laser and inkjet (to indicate the type of printer), and two shared disk 
folders, named AccountingData and MarketingData.
	
✓	Server-based networks have a username for the network administrator.
	
	If you log on using the administrator’s username, you can do anything 
you want: add new users, define new network resources, change Wally’s 
password, anything. The administrator’s username is usually something 
clever such as Administrator.
	
✓	The network itself has a name.
	
	The Windows world has two basic types of networks:
 
• Domain networks are the norm for large corporate environments 
that have dedicated servers with IT staff to maintain them.
 
• Workgroup networks are more common in homes or in small offices 
that don’t have dedicated servers or IT staff.
	
	A domain network is known by — you guessed it — a domain name. And 
a workgroup network is identified by — drum roll, please — a workgroup 
name. Regardless of which type of network you use, you need to know 
this name to gain access to the network.

24
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
Logging On to the Network
To use network resources, you must connect your computer to the network, 
and you must go through the supersecret process of logging on, which is how 
you let the network know who you are so that it can decide whether you’re 
one of the good guys.
Logging on is a little bit like cashing a check. You must have two forms of 
identification:
	
✓	Your username: The name by which the network knows you.
	
	Your username is usually some variation of your real name, like Beav for 
the Beaver.
	
	Everyone who uses the network must have a username.
	
✓	Your password: A secret word that only you and the network know. If you 
type the correct password, the network believes that you are who you 
say you are.
	
	Every user has a different password, and the password should be a secret.
In the early days of computer networking, you had to type a logon command 
at a stark MS-DOS prompt and then supply your user ID and password. 
Nowadays, the glory of Windows is that you get to log on to the network 
through a special network logon screen. Figure 2-1 shows the Windows 8 
version of this dialog box.
	
Figure 2-1: 
Logging 
in to a 
Windows 8 
system.
	

25
 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
	
Here are some more logon points to ponder:
	
✓	The terms user ID and logon name are sometimes used instead of user­
name. They all mean the same thing.
	
✓	As long as we’re talking about words that mean the same thing, log in 
and log on mean the same thing, as do (respectively) log out and log off 
as ways of saying, “I’m outta here.” Although you see both out there in 
the world, this book uses log on and log off throughout — and if there’s 
any exception, the book says why and grouses about it a bit.
	
✓	As far as the network’s concerned, you and your computer aren’t the 
same thing. Your username refers to you, not to your computer. That’s 
why you have a username and your computer has a computer name. 
You can log on to the network by using your username from any com­
puter that’s attached to the network. Other users can log on at your 
computer by using their own usernames.
	
	When others log on at your computer by using their own usernames, 
they can’t access any of your network files that are protected by your 
password. However, they can access any local files that you haven’t pro­
tected. Be careful which people you allow to use your computer.
	
✓	If you’re logging on to a domain network on a Windows Vista, Windows 
7, or Windows 8 computer, you must type the domain name before your 
username, separated from it by a backslash. For example:
lowewriter\dlowe
	
	Here, the domain name is lowewriter, and the username is dlowe.
	
	Note that Windows remembers the domain and username from your last 
login, so ordinarily all you have to enter is your password. To log on to a 
different domain or as a different user, you must click Switch User. Then 
you can click the Other User icon and enter a different domain name and 
username, along with the password for the user you want to log on as.
	
✓	On an older Windows XP system, the logon dialog box has a field in 
which you can enter the domain name you want to log on to.
	
✓	Your computer may be set up so that it logs you on automatically when­
ever you turn it on. In that case, you don’t have to type your username 
and password. This setup makes the task of logging on more convenient 
but takes the sport out of it. And it’s a terrible idea if you’re the least bit 
worried about bad guys getting into your network or personal files.
	
✓	Guard your password with your life. I’d tell you mine, but then I’d have 
to shoot you.

Understanding Shared Folders
Long ago, in the days Before Network (B.N.), your computer probably had 
just one hard drive, known as the C: drive. Maybe it had two — C: and D:. 
The second drive might be another hard disk, or possibly a CD-ROM or DVD-
ROM drive. Even to this day, the descendants of those drives are physically 
located inside your PC. They’re your local drives.
Now that you’re on a network, however, you may have access to drives that 
aren’t located inside your PC but are located instead in one of the other com­
puters on the network. These network drives can be located on a dedicated 
server computer or, in the case of a peer-to-peer network, on another client 
computer.
In some cases, you can access an entire network drive over the network. But in 
most cases, you can’t access the entire drive. Instead, you can access only 
certain folders on the network drives. Either way, the shared drives or folders 
are known in Windows terminology as shared folders.
Here’s where it gets confusing: The most common way to access a shared 
folder is to assign a drive letter to it. Suppose that a server has a shared folder 
named Marketing. You can assign drive letter M to this shared folder. Then 
you access the Marketing folder as drive M:. The M: drive is then called a 
network drive because it uses the network to access data in a shared folder. 
Assigning a drive letter to a shared folder is mapping a drive.
Shared folders can be set up with restrictions on how you can use them. For 
example, you may be granted full access to some shared folders so that you 
can copy files to or from them, delete files on them, or create or remove fold­
ers on them. On other shared folders, your access may be limited in certain 
ways. For example, you may be able to copy files to or from the shared folder 
but not delete files, edit files, or create new folders. You may also be asked 
to enter a password before you can access a protected folder. The amount of 
disk space you’re allowed to use on a shared folder may also be limited. For 
more information about file-sharing restrictions, see Chapter 12.
	
In addition to accessing shared folders that reside on other people’s comput­
ers, you can designate your computer as a server to enable other network 
users to access folders that you share. To find out how to share folders on 
your computer with other network users, see Chapter 3.
Four Good Uses for a Shared Folder
After you know which shared network folders are available, you may wonder 
what you’re supposed to do with them. This section describes four good uses 
for a network folder.

27
 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
Store files that everybody needs
A shared network folder is a good place to store files that more than one 
user needs to access. Without a network, you have to store a copy of the file 
on everyone’s computer, and you have to worry about keeping the copies 
synchronized (which you can’t do, no matter how hard you try). Or you can 
keep the file on a disk and pass it around. Or you can keep the file on one 
computer and play Musical Chairs; whenever someone needs to use the file, 
he goes to the computer that contains the file.
On a network, you can keep one copy of the file in a shared folder on the 
network, and everyone can access it.
Store your own files
You can also use a shared network folder as an extension of your own hard 
drive storage. For example, if you filled up all the free space on your hard drive 
with pictures, sounds, and movies that you downloaded from the Internet, 
but the network server has billions and billions of gigabytes of free space, 
you have all the drive space you need. Just store your files on the network 
drive!
Here are a few guidelines for storing files on network drives:
	
✓	Using the network drive for your own files works best if the network 
drive is set up for private storage that other users can’t access. That 
way, you don’t have to worry about the nosy guy down in Accounting 
who likes to poke around in other people’s files.
	
✓	Don’t overuse the network drive. Remember that other users have 
probably filled up their own hard drives, so they want to use the space 
on the network drive too.
	
✓	Before you store personal files on a network drive, make sure that you 
have permission. A note from your mom will do.
	
✓	On domain networks, a drive (typically, drive H:) is commonly mapped 
to a user’s home folder. The home folder is a network folder that’s unique 
for each user. You can think of it as a network version of My Documents. 
If your network is set up with a home folder, use it rather than My 
Documents for any important work-related files. That’s because the home 
folder is usually included in the network’s daily backup schedule. By con­
trast, most networks do not back up data you store in My Documents.

28
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
Make a temporary resting place for 
files on their way to other users
“Hey, Wally, could you send me a copy of last month’s baseball stats?”
“Sure, Beav.” But how? If the baseball stats file resides on Wally’s local drive, 
how does Wally send a copy of the file to Beaver’s computer? Wally can do 
it by copying the file to a network drive. Then Beaver can copy the file to his 
local hard drive.
Here are some tips to keep in mind when you use a network drive to 
exchange files with other network users:
	
✓	Remember to delete files that you saved to the network drive after 
they’re picked up! Otherwise, the network drive quickly fills up with 
unnecessary files.
	
✓	Create a folder on the network drive specifically intended for holding 
files en route to other users. I like to name this folder PITSTOP.
	
In many cases, it’s easier to send files to other network users by e-mail than 
by using a network folder. Just send a message to the other network user and 
attach the file you want to share. The advantage of sending a file by e-mail is 
that you don’t have to worry about details like where to leave the file on the 
server and who’s responsible for deleting the file.
Back up your local hard drive
If enough drive space is available on the file server, you can use it to store 
backup copies of the files on your hard drive. Just copy the files that you 
want to back up to a shared network folder.
Obviously, if you copy all your data files to the network drive — and every­
body else follows suit — it can fill up quickly. Check with the network man­
ager before you start storing backup copies of your files on the server. The 
manager may have already set up a special network drive that’s designed just 
for backups. And if you’re lucky, your network manager may be able to set up 
an automatic backup schedule for your important data so that you don’t have 
to remember to back it up manually.

29
 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
I hope that your network administrator also routinely backs up the contents 
of the network server’s disk to tape. (Yes, tape — see Chapter 20 for details.) 
That way, if something happens to the network server, the data can be recov­
ered from the backup tapes.
Oh, the Network Places You’ll Go
Windows enables you to access network resources, such as shared folders, 
by browsing the network. In Windows XP, you do this by double-clicking 
the My Network Places icon that resides on your desktop. In Windows 
Vista and Windows 7, choose Network from the Start menu. In Windows 8, 
open Windows Explorer (click File Explorer on the taskbar) and then click 
Network. Figure 2-2 shows the Windows 8 version of the network browser.
	
Figure 2-2: 
Browsing 
the network 
in 
Windows 8.
	
The network shown in Figure 2-2 consists of 45 computers, with names 
such as BCFCOM1, BCFFS03, and so on. You can open one of the computers 
by double-clicking its icon to reveal a list of shared resources available on 
the computer. For example, Figure 2-3 shows the resources shared by the 
BCFFS03 computer.

computer.
	
You can also browse the network from any Windows application program. 
For example, you may be working with Microsoft Word 2010 and want to 
open a document file that’s stored in a shared folder on your network. All you 
have to do is use the Open command to bring up the dialog box. (In Office 
2003 and 2010, this command is on the File menu. In Office 2007, you’ll find it 
by clicking the Office button.) Choose Network in the list that appears in the 
pane on the left of the Open dialog box to browse the network, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.

 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
Mapping Network Drives
	
If you often access a particular shared folder, you may want to use the special 
trick known as mapping to access the shared folder more efficiently. Mapping 
assigns a drive letter to a shared folder. Then you can use the drive letter 
to access the shared folder as though it were a local drive. In this way, you 
can access the shared folder from any Windows program without having to 
browse the network.
For example, you can map a shared folder named Data on the server named 
SERVER01 Files to drive K: on your computer. Then, to access files stored in 
the shared Data folder, you look on drive K.
To map a shared folder to a drive letter, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open File Explorer.
 
• Windows Vista or 7: Choose Start➪Computer.
 
• Windows 8: Open the desktop and click the File Explorer icon on 
the taskbar, and then click Computer in the Location list on the left 
side of the screen.
	
2.	Open the Map Network Drive dialog box.
 
• Windows Vista and 7: Access this dialog by clicking the Map 
Network Drive button located on the toolbar.
 
• Windows 8: Click Map Network Drive on the ribbon.
	
	Figure 2-5 shows the Map Network Drive dialog box for Windows 8. The 
dialog box for earlier versions of Windows is similar.
	
Figure 2-5:

Network 
Drive dialog 
box.
	

32
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
	
3.	(Optional) Change the drive letter in the Drive drop-down list.
	
	You probably don’t have to change the drive letter that Windows selects 
(in Figure 2-5, drive R). If you’re picky, though, you can select the drive 
letter from the Drive drop-down list.
	
4.	Click the Browse button.
	
	This step summons the dialog box shown in Figure 2-6.
	
Figure 2-6: 
Browsing 
for the 
folder to 
map.
	
	
5.	Use the Browse for Folder dialog box to find and select the shared 
folder you want to use.
	
	You can navigate to any shared folder on any computer in the network.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	The Browse for Folder dialog box is dismissed, and you return to the 
Map Network Drive dialog box (refer to Figure 2-5).
	
7.	(Optional) If you want this network drive to be automatically mapped 
each time you log on to the network, select the Reconnect at Sign-in 
check box.
	
	 If you leave the Reconnect at Logon check box deselected, the drive 
letter is available only until you shut down Windows or log out of the 
network. If you select this option, the network drive reconnects auto­
matically each time you log on to the network.
	
	 Be sure to select the Reconnect at Logon check box if you use the net­
work drive often.
	
8.	Click OK.
	
	You return to the Computer window, as shown in Figure 2-7. Here, you 
can see the newly mapped network drive.

33
 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
	
Figure 2-7: 
The 
Computer 
folder 
shows a 
mapped net-
work drive.
	
Your network administrator may have already set up your computer with 
one or more mapped network drives. If so, you can ask her to tell you which 
network drives have been mapped. Or you can just open the Computer folder 
(My Computer on Windows XP) and have a look.
Here are a few additional tips:
	
✓	If you’re using Windows XP, the procedure for mapping a network 
drive is similar to the one for Windows Vista. Start by opening My 
Computer and choosing Tools➪Map Network Drive. Then follow the 
preceding set of steps, starting at Step 3.
	
✓	Assigning a drive letter to a network drive is called mapping the 
drive, or linking the drive, by network nerds. “Drive Q: is mapped to a 
network drive,” they say.
	
✓	Network drive letters don’t have to be assigned the same way for 
every computer on the network. For example, a network drive that’s 
assigned drive letter M on your computer may be assigned drive letter 
Z on someone else’s computer. In that case, your drive M: and the other 
computer’s drive Z: refer to the same data. This arrangement can be 
confusing. If your network is set up this way, put pepper in your network 
administrator’s coffee.
	
✓	Accessing a shared network folder through a mapped network drive is 
much faster than accessing the same folder by browsing the network. 
Windows has to browse the entire network to list all available computers 

34
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
whenever you browse the network. By contrast, Windows doesn’t have 
to browse the network to access a mapped network drive.
	
✓	If you select the Reconnect at Logon option for a mapped drive (refer 
to Figure 2-5), you receive a warning message if the drive isn’t available 
when you log on. In most cases, the problem is that the server computer 
isn’t turned on. Sometimes, however, this message is caused by a broken 
network connection. For more information about fixing network problems 
such as this one, see Chapter 19.
Using a Network Printer
Using a network printer is much like using a network hard drive: You can 
print to a network printer from any Windows program by choosing the Print 
command to call up a Print dialog box from any program and choosing a net­
work printer from the list of available printers. In Office 2003 and 2010, this 
command is on the File menu. In Office 2007, you can reach it by clicking the 
Office button.
Keep in mind, however, that printing on a network printer isn’t exactly the 
same as printing on a local printer; you have to take turns. When you print 
on a local printer, you’re the only one using it. When you print to a network 
printer, however, you are (in effect) standing in line behind other network 
users, waiting to share the printer. This line complicates the situation in 
several ways:
	
✓	If several users print to the network printer at the same time, the net­
work has to keep the print jobs separate from one another. If it didn’t, 
the result would be a jumbled mess, with your 268-page report getting 
mixed in with the payroll checks. That would be bad. Fortunately, the 
network takes care of this situation by using the fancy print spooling 
feature.
	
✓	Network printing works on a first-come, first-served basis (unless you 
know some of the tricks that I discuss in Chapter 3). Invariably, when 
I get in line at the hardware store, the person in front of me is trying to 
buy something that doesn’t have a product code on it. I end up standing 
there for hours waiting for someone in Plumbing to pick up the phone 
for a price check. Network printing can be like that. If someone sends a 
two-hour print job to the printer before you send your half-page memo, 
you have to wait.
	
✓	You may have access to a local printer and several network printers. 
Before you were forced to use the network, your computer probably had 
just one printer attached to it. You may want to print some documents 
on your cheap (oops, I mean local) inkjet printer but use the network 
laser printer for important stuff. To do that, you have to find out how to 
use your programs’ functions for switching printers.

35
 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
Adding a network printer
Before you can print to a network printer, you have to configure your computer 
to access the network printer that you want to use. From the Start menu, open 
the Control Panel and then double-click the Printers icon. If your computer 
is already configured to work with a network printer, an icon for the network 
printer appears in the Printers folder. You can tell a network printer from a 
local printer by the shape of the printer icon. Network printer icons have a 
pipe attached to the bottom of the printer.
If you don’t have a network printer configured for your computer, you can 
add one by using the Add Printer Wizard. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Control Panel.
 
• Windows 7 or earlier: Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
• Windows 8: Press the Windows key, type Control, and then click 
the Control Panel icon.
	
2.	Click Devices and Printers.
	
3.	Click the Add a Printer button on the toolbar.
	
	 This step starts the Add Printer Wizard, as shown in Figure 2-8.
	
4.	Click the printer you want to use.
	
	 If you can’t find the printer you want to use, ask your network administrator 
for the printer’s UNC path, which is the name used to identify the printer 
on the network, or its IP address. Then click The Printer That I Want Isn’t 
Listed and enter the UNC or IP address for the printer when prompted.
	
Figure 2-8: 
The Add 
Printer 
Wizard asks 
you to pick a 
printer.
	

36
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
	
5.	Click Next to add the printer.
	
	 The wizard copies to your computer the correct printer driver for the 
network printer. (You may be prompted to confirm that you want to add 
the driver. If so, click Install Driver to proceed.)
	
	 The Add Printer Wizard displays a screen that shows the printer’s name 
and asks whether you want to designate the printer as your default printer.
	
6.	(Optional) Designate the printer as your default printer.
	
7.	Click Next to continue.
	
	 A final confirmation dialog box is displayed.
	
8.	Click Finish.
	
	You’re done!
	
Many network printers, especially newer ones, are connected directly to the 
network by using a built-in Ethernet card. Setting up these printers can be 
tricky. You may need to ask the network administrator for help in setting up 
this type of printer. (Some printers that are connected directly to the network 
have their own web addresses, such as Printer.CleaverFamily.com. If 
that’s the case, you can often set up the printer in a click or two: Use your 
browser to go to the printer’s web page and then click a link that enables you 
to install the printer.)
Printing to a network printer
After you install the network printer in Windows, printing to the network 
printer is a snap. You can print to the network printer from any Windows 
program by using the Print command to summon the Print dialog box, 
which is usually found on the File menu. For example, Figure 2-9 shows the 
Print dialog box for WordPad (the free text-editing program that comes with 
Windows). The available printers are listed near the top of this dialog box. 
Choose the network printer from this list and then click OK to print your 
document. That’s all there is to it!
Playing with the print queue
After you send your document to a network printer, you usually don’t have 
to worry about it. You just go to the network printer, and voilà! Your printed 
document is waiting for you.

37
 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
	
Figure 2-9: 
A typical 
Print  
dialog box.
	
That’s what happens in the ideal world. In the real world, where you and I 
live, all sorts of things can happen to your print job between the time you 
send it to the network printer and the time it prints:
	
✓	You discover that someone else already sent a 50 trillion–page report 
ahead of you that isn’t expected to finish printing until the national debt 
is paid off.
	
✓	The price of a framis valve suddenly goes up by $2, rendering foolish the 
recommendations you made in your report.
	
✓	Your boss calls and tells you that his brother-in-law will be attending 
the meeting, so won’t you please print an extra copy of the proposal for 
him? Oh, and a photocopy won’t do. Originals only, please.
	
✓	You decide to take lunch, so you don’t want the output to print until you 
get back.
Fortunately, your print job isn’t totally beyond your control just because 
you already sent it to the network printer. You can easily change the status 
of jobs that you already sent. You can change the order in which jobs print, 
hold a job so that it doesn’t print until you say so, or cancel a job.
You can probably make your network print jobs do other tricks, too: shake 
hands, roll over, and play dead. But the basic tricks — hold, cancel, and 
change the print order — are enough to get you started.
To play with the printer queue, open the Control Panel by choosing Start➪
Control Panel in Windows 7 or earlier; or press the Windows key, type 
Control, and the click the Control Panel icon. Then click Devices and Printers 
and double-click the icon for the printer that you want to manage. A window 
similar to the one shown in Figure 2-10 appears. You can see that just one 
document has been sent to the printer.

38
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
	
Figure 2-10: 
Managing a 
print queue.
	
To manipulate the print jobs that appear in the print queue or in the printer 
itself, use these tricks:
	
✓	To temporarily stop a job from printing: Select the job and choose 
Document➪Pause Printing. Choose the same command again to release 
the job from its state of frustration and print it out, already.
	
✓	To delete a print job: Select the job and choose Document➪Cancel 
Printing.
	
✓	To stop the printer: Choose Printer➪Pause Printing. To resume, choose 
the command again.
	
✓	To delete all print jobs: Choose Printer➪Purge Print Documents.
	
✓	To cut to the front of the line: Drag to the top of the list the print job 
that you want to print.
All these tips apply to your print jobs only. Unfortunately, you can’t capri­
ciously delete other people’s print jobs.
The best thing about Windows printer management is that it shelters you 
from the details of working with different network operating systems. 
Whether you print on a NetWare printer, a Windows 2003 network printer, or 
a shared Windows printer, the Printer window icon manages all print jobs in 
the same way.
Logging Off the Network
After you finish using the network, log off. Logging off the network makes the 
network drives and printers unavailable. Your computer is still physically 
connected to the network (unless you cut the network cable with pruning 
shears; it’s a bad idea — don’t do it!), but the network and its resources are 
unavailable to you.

39
 Chapter 2: Life on the Network
Here are a few other tips to keep in mind when you log off:
	
✓	After you turn off your computer, you’re automatically logged off the 
network. After you start your computer, you have to log on again.
	
	Logging off the network is a good idea if you’re going to leave your 
computer unattended for a while. As long as your computer is logged in 
to the network, anyone can use it to access the network. And because 
unauthorized users can access it under your user ID, you get the blame 
for any damage they do.
	
✓	In Windows, you can log off the network by clicking the Start button and 
choosing the Log Off command. This process logs you off the network 
without restarting Windows:
 
• In Windows XP: You can reach this command directly from the 
Start menu.
 
• In Windows Vista or 7: Click Start and then click the right-facing 
arrow that appears next to the little padlock icon.
 
• In Windows 8: Press Ctrl+Alt+Del and then choose Sign Out.

C

hapter 2 introduces you to the basics of using a network: logging on, 
accessing data on shared network folders, printing, and logging off. In 
this chapter, I go beyond these basics. You find out how to turn your com­
puter into a server that shares its own files and printers, how to use one of 
the most popular network computer applications — e-mail — and how to 
work with Office on a network.
Sharing Your Stuff
As you probably know, networks consist of two types of computers: client 
computers and server computers. In the economy of computer networks, 
client computers are the consumers — the ones that use network resources, 
such as shared printers and disk drives. Servers are the providers — the ones 
that offer their own printers and hard drives to the network so that the client 
computers can use them.
This chapter shows you how to turn your humble Windows client computer 
into a server computer so that other computers on your network can use 
your printer and any folders that you decide you want to share. In effect, 
your computer functions as both a client and a server at the same time. A 
couple of examples show how:

42
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
	
✓	It’s a client when you send a print job to a network printer or when you 
access a file stored on another server’s hard drive.
	
✓	It’s a server when someone else sends a print job to your printer or 
accesses a file stored on your computer’s hard drive.
Enabling File and Printer 
Sharing (Windows XP)
Before you can share your files or your printer with other network users, you 
must set up a Windows File and Printer Sharing feature. Without this feature 
installed, your computer can be a network client but not a server. This sec­
tion shows you how to enable this feature for Windows XP. For Windows 
Vista, see the next section, “Enabling File and Printer Sharing (Windows 
Vista).”
If you’re lucky, the File and Printer Sharing feature is already set up on your 
computer. To find out, double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop. 
Select the icon for your C: drive and then click File on the menu bar to reveal 
the File menu. If the menu includes a Sharing command, File and Printer 
Sharing is already set up, so you can skip the rest of this section. If you can’t 
find a Sharing command on the File menu, you have to install File and Printer 
Sharing before you can share a file or printer with other network users.
To enable File and Printer Sharing on a Windows XP system, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Start menu, choose Settings➪Control Panel.
	
	The Control Panel comes to life.
	
2.	Double-click the Network Connections icon.
	
	The Network Connections window appears.
	
3.	Right-click Local Area Connection and choose Properties.
	
	The Local Area Connection properties dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 3-1.
	
4.	Make sure the File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks option is 
checked.
	
5.	Click OK.

While you’re working in the Network dialog box, don’t mess around with any 
of the other network settings. You can safely change the File and Print Sharing 
options, but leave the rest of the settings in the Network dialog box alone.
Enabling File and Printer Sharing 
(Windows Vista)
To enable file and printer sharing in Windows Vista, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Start➪Network.
	
	 This step opens the Network folder.
	
2.	Click the Network and Sharing Center button on the toolbar.
	
	 This step opens the Network and Sharing Center, as shown in Figure 3-2.
	
3.	Click the down arrow to the right of File Sharing in the Sharing and 
Discovery section.
	
	 This step reveals the controls that enable you to activate file sharing, as 
shown in Figure 3-3.

	 You’re done; you can now share your files and printers.
Enabling File and Printer Sharing 
(Windows 7 and 8)
Here are the steps to enable file and printer sharing in Windows 7:
	
1.	Click the Start button, type Control Panel, and press Enter.
	
	This step opens the Control Panel.
	
2.	Double-click the Network and Sharing Center icon and then click 
Change Advanced Sharing Settings.
	
	 This step opens the Advanced Sharing Settings page, which lists net­
work settings for each network you’re connected to.
 
• For a home computer running Windows 7: Two networks are listed: 
Home or Work, and Public.
 
• In Windows 8: The Home or Work network is called Private.
 
• For a computer connected to a domain network: A third network 
named Domain is listed.
	
3.	Click the down arrow next to the network you want to enable file and 
printer sharing for.
 
• For a home computer: Click the down arrow next to Home or Work 
(Windows 7) or Private (Windows 8).
 
• For a computer connected to a domain network: Click the down 
arrow next to Domain.
	
	 Figure 3-4 shows the settings for a Domain network. The settings for a 
Home or Work network are the same.
	
	 Do not enable file or printer sharing for the Public network. Enabling file 
or printer sharing on a public network exposes your computer’s data to 
other users on the same public network.

5.	Click the Save Changes button.
	
	 This action saves your changes and closes the Advanced Sharing 
Settings page.
Sharing a Folder
To enable other network users to access files that reside on your hard drive, 
you must designate a folder on the drive as a shared folder. Note that you can 
also share an entire drive, if you so desire. If you share an entire drive, other 
network users can access all the files and folders on the drive. If you share 
a folder, network users can access only those files that reside in the folder 
you share. (If the folder you share contains other folders, network users can 
access files in those folders, too.)
	
Don’t share an entire hard drive unless you want to grant everyone on the net­
work the freedom to sneak a peek at every file on your hard drive. Instead, you 
should share just the folder or folders containing the specific documents that 
you want others to be able to access. For example, if you store all your Word 
documents in the My Documents folder, you can share your My Documents 
folder so that other network users can access your Word documents.

47
 Chapter 3: More Ways to Use Your Network
Sharing a folder in Windows XP
To share a folder on a Windows XP computer, follow these steps:
	
1.	Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.
	
	The My Computer window comes to center stage.
	
2.	Select the folder that you want to share.
	
	Click the icon for the drive that contains the folder you want to share, 
and then find the folder itself and click it.
	
3.	Choose File➪Sharing and Security.
	
	The Properties dialog box for the folder that you want to share appears. 
Notice that the sharing options are grayed out.
	
4.	Select the Share This Folder on the Network option.
	
	After you select this option, the rest of the sharing options come alive, 
as shown in Figure 3-5.
	
	 If you prefer, you can skip Steps 2–4. Instead, just right-click the folder 
you want to share and then choose Sharing and Security from the menu 
that appears.
	
Figure 3-5: 
The Sharing 
options 
come to life 
when you 
select the 
Share This 
Folder on 
the Network 
check box 
(in Windows 
XP).
	
	
5.	(Optional) Change the share name if you don’t like the name that 
Windows proposes.
	
	The share name is the name that other network users use to access the 
shared folder. You can give it any name you want, but the name can be 

48
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
no more than 12 characters long. Uppercase and lowercase letters are 
treated the same in a share name, so the name My Documents is the 
same as MY DOCUMENTS.
	
	 Windows proposes a share name for you, based on the actual folder 
name. If the folder name has 12 or fewer characters, the proposed share 
name is the same as the folder name. If the folder name is longer than 
12 characters, however, Windows abbreviates it. For example, the name 
Multimedia Files becomes MULTIMEDIA F.
	
	 If the name that Windows chooses doesn’t make sense or seems cryp­
tic, you can change the share name to something better. For example, I 
would probably use MEDIA FILES rather than MULTIMEDIA F.
	
6.	(Optional) If you want to allow other network users to change the 
files in this folder, select the Allow Network Users to Change My Files 
check box.
	
	If you leave this option deselected, other network users can open your 
files, but they can’t save any changes they make.
	
7.	Click OK.
	
	 The Properties dialog box vanishes, and a hand is added to the icon for 
the folder to show that the folder is shared.
If you change your mind and decide that you want to stop sharing a folder, 
double-click the My Computer icon, select the folder or drive that you want to 
stop sharing, and choose File➪Sharing to summon the Properties dialog box. 
Deselect the Share This Folder on the Network check box and then click OK.
Sharing a folder in Windows Vista, 7, or 8
To share a folder in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Open File Explorer.
 
• Windows Vista or 7: Choose Start➪Computer.
 
• Windows 8: Open the desktop and click the File Explorer icon on 
the taskbar; then click Computer in the Location list on the left 
side of the screen.
	
2.	Navigate to the folder you want to share.
	
3.	Right-click the folder you want to share and choose Properties.
	
	The Properties dialog box appears.
	
4.	Click the Sharing tab and then click the Share button.
	
	The File Sharing dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-6.

	This action designates that anyone on your network can access the 
shared folder.
	
	 If you prefer, you can limit access to just certain users. To do so, select

6.	Select the level of access you want to grant each user.
	
	You can use the drop-down list in the Permission Level column to 
choose from three levels of access:
	
• Reader: A reader can open files but can’t modify or create new files 
or folders.
	
• Contributor: A contributor can add files to the share but can change 
or delete only her own files.
	
• Owner: An owner has full access to the shared folder. He or she 
can create, change, or delete any file in the folder.
	
7.	Click Share.
	
	A confirmation dialog box appears to confirm that the folder has been 
shared.

Using the Public Folder in Windows 
Vista or Windows 7 or 8
Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 include an alternative method of 
sharing files on the network: the Public folder. The Public folder is simply a 
folder that’s designated for public access. Files you save in this folder can be 
accessed by other users on the network and by any user who logs on to your 
computer.
Before you can use the Public folder, you must enable it. In Windows 7 or 8, 
just follow the steps listed in the section “Enabling File and Printer Sharing 
(Windows 7 and 8)” earlier in this chapter, but choose the Turn on Sharing 
option in the Public Sharing Settings section. For Windows Vista, follow the 
steps in the earlier section “Enabling File and Printer Sharing (Windows 
Vista),” but choose the Public Sharing option instead of the File Sharing and 
Printer Sharing options.
After you enable Public folder sharing, you can access the Public folder on 
your own computer in Windows Vista by choosing Start➪Computer and 
then clicking the Public icon in the pane on the left side of the window. To 
open the Public folder in Windows 7, choose Start➪Computer, expand the 
Libraries item in the left pane, and then expand the Documents, Music, 
Pictures, or Videos items. In Windows 8, open the desktop, click the File 
Explorer icon on the taskbar, expand the Libraries item in the left pane, and 
then expand the Documents, Music, Pictures or Videos items.
Figure 3-7 shows an example of a Public folder in Windows 8.
As you can see, the Public folder includes several predefined subfolders 
designed for sharing documents, downloaded files, music, pictures, and 
videos. You can use these subfolders if you want, or you can create your own 
subfolders to help organize the data in your Public folder.
	
To access the Public folder of another computer, use the techniques that I 
describe in Chapter 2 to either browse to the Public folder or map it to a net­
work drive.

Sharing a Printer
Sharing a printer is much more traumatic than sharing a hard drive. When 
you share a hard drive, other network users access your files from time to 
time. When they do, you hear your drive click a few times, and your com­
puter may hesitate for a half-second or so. The interruptions caused by other 
users accessing your drive are sometimes noticeable but rarely annoying.
When you share a printer, you get to see Murphy’s Law in action: Your co-
worker down the hall is liable to send a 140-page report to your printer just 
moments before you try to print a 1-page memo that has to be on the boss’s 
desk in two minutes. The printer may run out of paper — or worse, jam — 
during someone else’s print job — and you’re expected to attend to the 
problem.
Although these interruptions can be annoying, sharing your printer makes 
a lot of sense in some situations. If you have the only decent printer in your 
office or workgroup, everyone will bug you to let them use it anyway. You 
may as well share the printer on the network. At least this way, they won’t 
line up at your door to ask you to print their documents for them.

Sharing a printer in Windows XP
The following procedure shows you how to share a printer in Windows XP:
	
1.	From the Start menu, choose Printers and Faxes.
	
	The Printers and Faxes folder appears, as shown in Figure 3-8. In this 
example, the Printers folder lists a single printer, named HP PSC 750.
	
Figure 3-8: 
The Printers 
and Faxes 
folder.
	
	
2.	Select the printer that you want to share.
	
	Click the icon for the printer to select the printer.
	
3.	Choose File➪Sharing.
	
	You’re right: This command doesn’t make sense. You’re sharing a 
printer, not a file, but the Sharing command is on the File menu. Go 
figure.
	
	 When you choose File➪Sharing, the Properties dialog box for the printer 
appears.
	
4.	Select the Share This Printer option.
	
5.	(Optional) Change the share name if you don’t like the name sug­
gested by Windows.
	
	Other computers use the share name to identify the shared printer, so 
choose a meaningful or descriptive name.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 You return to the Printers folder, where a hand is added to the printer 
icon to show that the printer is now a shared network printer.

53
 Chapter 3: More Ways to Use Your Network
To take your shared printer off the network so that other network users can’t 
access it, follow Steps 1–3 in the preceding set of steps to open the Printer 
Properties dialog box. Select the Do Not Share This Printer option and then 
click OK. The hand disappears from the printer icon to indicate that the 
printer is no longer shared.
Sharing a printer in Windows Vista, 
Windows 7, or Windows 8
To share a printer in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Open the Control Panel.
 
• Windows 7 or earlier: Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
• Windows 8: Press the Windows key, type Control, and then click 
the Control Panel icon.
	
2.	Click Devices and Printers.
	
3.	Right-click the printer that you want to share and choose Printer 
Properties.
	
	 The Properties dialog box for the printer appears.
	
4.	Click the Sharing tab.
	
	The Sharing tab appears, as shown in Figure 3-9. Notice that the options 
for sharing the printer are disabled.

Using Microsoft Office on a Network
Microsoft Office is far and away the most popular suite of application programs 
used on personal computers, and it includes the most common types of 
application programs used in an office: a word processing program (Word), a 
spreadsheet program (Excel), a presentation program (PowerPoint), and an 
excellent e-mail program (Outlook). Depending on the version of Office you 
purchase, you may also get a database program (Access), a desktop publishing 
program (Publisher), a set of Ginsu knives (KnifePoint), and a slicer and dicer 
(ActiveSalsa).
This section describes the networking features of Microsoft Office System 
2010, the latest and greatest version of Office. Most of these features also 
work with previous versions of Office.
	
To get the most from using Office on a network, you should purchase the 
Microsoft Office Resource Kit. The Office Resource Kit, also known as ORK, 
contains information about installing and using Office on a network and comes 
with a CD that has valuable tools. If you don’t want to purchase the ORK, you 
can view it online and download the ORK tools from the Microsoft TechNet 
website (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/). Nanoo-nanoo, 
Earthling.
Installing Office on a network — 
some options
You need to make some basic decisions when you prepare to install 
Microsoft Office on a network. In particular, here are some possible 
approaches to installing Microsoft Office on your network clients:

55
 Chapter 3: More Ways to Use Your Network
	
✓	You can simply ignore the fact that you have a network and purchase 
a separate copy of Office for each user on the network. Then you can 
install Office from the CD on each computer. This option works well if
 
• Your network is small.
 
• Each computer has ample disk space to hold the necessary Office 
files.
 
• Each computer has its own CD-ROM drive. (If the computer doesn’t 
have a CD-ROM drive, you can share a CD-ROM drive on another 
computer and install the software from the shared drive.)
	
✓	On a larger network, you can use the Office Setup program in 
Administrative Setup mode. This option lets you create a special type 
of setup on a network server disk from which you can install Office on 
network computers. Administrative Setup enables you to control the 
custom features selected for each network computer and reduce the 
amount of user interaction required to install Office on each computer.
	
	If you choose to use Administrative Setup, you can use the Network 
Installation Wizard, which comes with the Office Resource Kit. The 
Network Installation Wizard lets you customize settings for installing 
Office on client computers. For example, you can choose which Office 
components to install, provide default answers to yes/no questions 
that Setup asks the user while installing Office, and select the amount 
of interaction you want the Setup program to have with the user while 
installing Office.
	
No matter which option you choose for installing Office on your network, you 
must purchase either a copy of Office or a license to install Office for every 
computer that uses Office. Purchasing a single copy of Office and installing it 
on more than one computer is illegal.
Accessing network files
Opening a file that resides on a network drive is almost as easy as opening a 
file on a local drive. All Office programs use File➪Open to summon the Open 
dialog box, as shown in its Excel incarnation in Figure 3-10. (The Open dialog 
box is nearly identical in other Office programs.)
To access a file that resides on a network volume that’s mapped to a drive 
letter, all you have to do is use the drop-down list at the top of the dialog box 
to select the network drive. 
You can map a network drive directly from the Open dialog box by navigating 
to the folder you want to map, right-clicking the folder, and choosing Map 
Network Drive.

56
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
	
Figure 3-10: 
The Open 
dialog box in 
Excel 2010.
	
	
If you try to open a file that another network user has opened already, Office 
tells you that the file is already in use and offers to let you open a read-only 
version of the file. You can read and edit the read-only version, but Office 
doesn’t let you overwrite the existing version of the file. Instead, you have to 
use the Save As command to save your changes to a new file.
Using workgroup templates
Although an occasional sacrifice to the Office gods may make your computing 
life a bit easier, a template isn’t a place of worship. Rather, a template is a 
special type of document file that holds formatting information, boilerplate 
text, and other customized settings that you can use as the basis for new 
documents.
Three Office programs — Word, Excel, and PowerPoint — enable you to 
specify a template whenever you create a new document. When you create a 
new document in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint by choosing File➪New, you see 
a dialog box that lets you choose a template for the new document.
Office comes with a set of templates for the most common types of documents. 
These templates are grouped under the various tabs that appear across the 
top of the New dialog box.
In addition to the templates that come with Office, you can create your own 
templates in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Creating your own templates is 
especially useful if you want to establish a consistent look for documents pre­
pared by your network users. For example, you can create a Letter template 

57
 Chapter 3: More Ways to Use Your Network
that includes your company’s letterhead or a Proposal template that includes 
a company logo.
Office enables you to store templates in two locations. Where you put them 
depends on what you want to do with them:
	
✓	The User Templates folder on each user’s local disk drive: If a particular 
user needs a specialized template, put it here.
	
✓	The Workgroup Templates folder on a shared network drive: If you 
have templates that you want to make available to all network users on 
the network server, put them here. This arrangement still allows each 
user to create templates that aren’t available to other network users.
When you use both a User Templates folder and a Workgroup Templates 
folder, Office combines the templates from both folders and lists them in 
alphabetical order in the New dialog box. For example, the User Templates 
folder may contain templates named Blank Document and Web Page, and 
the Workgroup Templates folder may contain a template named Company 
Letterhead. In this case, three templates appear in the New dialog box, in this 
order: Blank Document, Company Letterhead, and Web Page.
To set the location of the User Templates and Workgroup Templates folders, 
follow these steps in Microsoft Word:
	
1.	Click the Office button and then click Word Options.
	
	The Word Options dialog box opens.
	
2.	Click the Advanced tab.
	
	The Advanced options appear.
	
3.	Scroll down to the General section and then click the File Locations 
button.
	
	 The File Locations dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-11.
	
4.	Double-click the Workgroup Templates item.
	
	 This step opens a dialog box that lets you browse to the location of your 
template files.
	
5.	Browse to the template files and then click OK.
	
	You return to the File Locations dialog box.
	
6.	Click OK to dismiss the File Locations dialog box.
	
	You return to the Word Options dialog box.
	
7.	Click OK again.
	
	The Word Options dialog box is dismissed.

file loca-
tions in 
Word 2010.
	
	
Although the User Templates and Workgroup Templates settings affect Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint, you can change these settings only from Word. The 
Options dialog boxes in Excel and PowerPoint don’t show the User Templates 
or Workgroup Templates options.
When you install Office, the standard templates that come with Office 
are copied into a folder on the computer’s local disk drive, and the User 
Templates option is set to this folder. The Workgroup Templates option is 
left blank. You can set the Workgroup Templates folder to a shared network 
folder by clicking Network Templates, clicking the Modify button, and speci­
fying a shared network folder that contains your workgroup templates.
Networking an Access database
If you want to share a Microsoft Access database among several network users, 
be aware of a few special considerations. Here are the most important ones:
	
✓	When you share a database, more than one user may try to access the 
same record at the same time. This situation can lead to problems if two 
or more users try to update the record. To handle this potential traffic 
snarl, Access locks the record so that only one user at a time can update 
it. Access uses one of three methods to lock records:
 
• Edited Record: This method locks a record whenever a user begins 
to edit a record. For example, if a user retrieves a record in a form 
that allows the record to be updated, Access locks the record 
while the user edits it so that other users can’t edit the record 
until the first record is finished.

59
 Chapter 3: More Ways to Use Your Network
 
• No Locks: This method doesn’t really mean that the record isn’t 
locked. Instead, No Locks means that the record isn’t locked until 
a user writes a change to the database. This method can be con­
fusing to users because it enables one user to overwrite changes 
made by another user.
 
• All Records: All Records locks an entire table whenever a user edits 
any record in the table.
	
✓	Access lets you split a database so that the forms, queries, and reports 
are stored on each user’s local disk drive, but the data itself is stored on 
a network drive. This feature can make the database run more efficiently 
on a network, but it’s a little more difficult to set up. (To split a database, 
choose Tools➪Database Utilities➪Database Splitter.)
	
✓	Access includes built-in security features that you should use if you share 
an Access database from a Windows client computer. If you store the 
database on a domain server, you can use the server’s security features 
to protect the database.
	
✓	Access automatically refreshes forms and datasheets every 60 seconds. 
That way, if one user opens a form or datasheet and another user changes 
the data a few seconds later, the first user sees the changes within one 
minute. If 60 seconds is too long (or too short) an interval, you can change 
the refresh rate by using the Advanced tab in the Options dialog box.
Working with Offline Files
Desktop computers are by nature stationary beasts. As a result, they’re 
almost always connected to their networks. Notebook computers, however, 
are more transitory. If you have a notebook computer, you’re likely to tote 
it around from place to place. If you have a network at work, you probably 
connect to the network when you’re at work. But then you take the notebook 
computer home for the weekend, and you aren’t connected to your network.
Of course, your boss wants you to spend your weekends working, so you 
need a way to access your important network files while you’re away from 
the office and disconnected from the network. That’s where the offline files 
feature comes in. It lets you access your network files even while you’re 
disconnected from the network.
It sounds like magic, but it isn’t really. Imagine how you’d work away from 
the network without this feature. You simply copy the files you need to work 
on to your notebook computer’s local hard disk. Then, when you take the 
computer home, you work on the local copies. When you get back to the 
office, you connect to the network and copy the modified files back to the 
network server.

60
Part I: Getting Started with Networking 
That’s essentially how the offline files feature works, except that Windows 
does all the copying automatically. Windows also uses smoke and mirrors to 
make it look like the copies are actually on the network even though you’re 
not connected to the network. For example, if you map a drive (drive M:, for 
example) and make it available offline, you can still access the offline copies 
of the file on the M: drive. That’s because Windows knows that when you 
aren’t connected to the network, it should redirect drive M: to its local copy 
of the drive M: files.
The main complication of working with offline files, of course, is what happens 
when two or more users want to access the same offline files. Windows can 
attempt to straighten that mess out for you, but it doesn’t do a great job of 
it. Your best bet is to not use the offline files feature with network resources 
that other users may want available offline, too. In other words, it’s okay to 
make your home drive available offline because that drive is accessible only 
to you. I don’t recommend making shared network resources available offline, 
though, unless they’re read-only resources that don’t contain files you intend 
to modify.
Using the offline files feature is easy:
	
✓	Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8: Open the Computer folder, 
right-click the mapped network drive you want to make available offline, 
and choose Always Available Offline.
	
✓	Windows XP: Open My Computer, right-click the mapped drive, and 
choose Make Available Offline.
If you don’t want to designate an entire mapped drive for offline access, you 
can designate individual folders within a mapped drive by using the same 
technique: Right-click the folder and then choose Always Available Offline 
(Make Available Offline in Windows XP).
When you first designate a drive or folder as available offline, Windows 
copies all the files on the drive or folder to local storage. Depending on how 
many files are involved, this process can take a while, so plan accordingly.
After you designate a drive as available offline, Windows takes care of the 
rest. Each time you log on to or out of the network, Windows synchronizes 
your offline files. Windows compares the time stamp on each file on both the 
server and the local copy and then copies any files that have changed.
Here are a few other thoughts to consider about offline files:
	
✓	If you want, you can force Windows to synchronize your offline files by 
right-clicking the drive or folder and choosing Sync.
	
✓	Make sure that no files in the folder are currently open at the time you 
set the Make Available Offline option. If any files are open, you’ll receive 

61
 Chapter 3: More Ways to Use Your Network
an error message. You have to close the open files before you can desig­
nate the folder for offline access.
	
✓	The Properties dialog box for mapped drives includes an Offline Files 
tab, as shown in Figure 3-12.
	
✓	Employers love the offline files feature because it encourages their 
employees to work at home during evenings and weekends. In fact, 
every time you use the offline files feature to work at home, your boss 
sends Bill Gates a nickel. That’s how he got so rich.

O

kay, so you’re convinced that you need to network your computers. 
What now? Do you stop by Computers-R-Us on the way to work, install 
the network before drinking your morning coffee, and expect the network to 
be fully operational by noon?
I don’t think so.
Networking your computers is just like any other worthwhile endeavor: Doing 
it right requires a bit of planning. This chapter helps you to think through 
your network before you start spending money. It shows you how to come 
up with a networking plan that’s every bit as good as the plan that a network 
consultant would charge thousands of dollars for. See? This book is already 
saving you money!
Making a Network Plan
Before you begin any networking project, whether a new network installation 
or an upgrade of an existing network, start with a detailed plan. If you make 
technical decisions too quickly before studying all the issues that affect the 
project, you’ll regret it. You’ll discover too late that a key application won’t 
run over the network, the network has unacceptably slow performance, or 
key components of the network don’t work together.

66
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Here are some general thoughts to keep in mind while you create your net­
work plan:
	
✓	Don’t rush the plan. The most costly networking mistakes are the ones 
that you make before you install the network. Think things through and 
consider alternatives.
	
✓	Write down the network plan. The plan doesn’t have to be a fancy, 500-
page document. If you want to make it look good, pick up a small three-
ring binder. This binder will be big enough to hold your network plan 
with room to spare.
	
✓	Ask someone else to read your network plan before you buy anything. 
Preferably, ask someone who knows more about computers than you do.
	
✓	Keep the plan up to date. If you add to the network, dig up the plan, 
dust it off, and update it.
	
“The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley, and leave us naught 
but grief and pain for promised joy.” Robert Burns lived a few hundred years 
before computer networks, but his famous words ring true. A network plan 
isn’t chiseled in stone. If you discover that something doesn’t work how you 
thought it would, that’s okay. Just change your plan.
Being Purposeful
One of the first steps in planning your network is making sure that you under­
stand why you want the network in the first place. Here are some of the more 
common reasons for needing a network, all of them quite valid:
	
✓	My co-worker and I exchange files using CDs or flash drives just about 
every day. With a network, it would be easier to trade files.
	
✓	I don’t want to buy everyone a color laser printer when I know the one 
we have now just sits there taking up space most of the day. So wouldn’t 
investing in a network be better than buying a color laser printer for 
every computer?
	
✓	I want everyone to be able to access the Internet. (Many networks, espe­
cially smaller ones, exist solely for sharing an Internet connection.)
	
✓	Business is so good that one person typing in orders eight hours each 
day can’t keep up. With a network, I can have two people entering 
orders, and I won’t have to pay overtime to either person.
	
✓	My brother-in-law just put in a network at his office, and I don’t want him 
to think that I’m behind the times.
	
✓	I already have a network, but it’s so old it may as well be made of kite 
string and tin cans. An improved network will speed up access to shared 
files, provide better security, and be easier to manage.

67
 Chapter 4: Planning a Network
Make sure that you identify all the reasons why you think you need a network 
and then write them down. Don’t worry about winning the Pulitzer Prize for 
your stunning prose. Just make sure that you write down what you expect a 
network to do for you.
If you were making a 500-page networking proposal, you’d place the descrip­
tion of why a network is needed in a tabbed section labeled “Justification.” In 
your network binder, file the description under “Purpose.”
	
As you consider the reasons why you need a network, you may conclude that 
you don’t need a network after all. That’s okay. You can always use the binder 
for your stamp collection.
Taking Stock
One of the most challenging parts of planning a network is figuring out how 
to work with the computers that you already have. In other words, how do 
you get from here to there? Before you can plan how to get “there,” you have 
to know where “here” is. In other words, you have to take a thorough inventory 
of your current computers.
What you need to know
You need to know the following information about each of your computers. 
Don’t sweat it right now if some of these terms don’t make sense. They’re all 
just pieces of the puzzle.
	
✓	The processor type and, if possible, its clock speed: It would be nice 
if each of your computers had a shiny new Core i7 six-core processor. 
In most cases, though, you find a mixture of computers: some new, 
some old, some borrowed, some blue. You may even find a few archaic 
Pentium computers.
	
	You can’t usually tell what kind of processor that a computer has just 
by looking at the computer’s case. Most computers, however, display 
the processor type when you turn them on or reboot them. If the infor­
mation on the startup screen scrolls too quickly for you to read it, try 
pressing the Pause key to freeze the information. After you finish reading 
it, press the Pause key again so that your computer can continue booting.
	
✓	The size of the hard drive and the arrangement of its partitions: To 
find out the size of your computer’s hard drive in Windows 8, 7, or Vista, 
open the Computer window (click Start, then click Computer), right-click 
the drive icon, and choose the Properties command from the shortcut 
menu that appears. Figure 4-1 shows the Properties dialog box for a 
922GB hard drive that has about 867GB of free space.

68
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
Figure 4-1: 
The 
Properties 
dialog box 
for a disk 
drive.
	
	
	If your computer has more than one hard drive, Windows lists an icon 
for each drive in the Computer window. Jot down the size and amount of 
free space available on each drive.
	
✓	The amount of memory: To find this information in Windows, right-click 
Computer from the Start menu and choose the Properties command. 
The amount of memory on your computer is shown in the dialog box 
that appears. For example, Figure 4-2 shows the System Properties 
dialog box for a computer with 8GB of RAM.
	
✓	The operating system version: This you can also deduce from the 
System Properties dialog box. For example, the Properties page shown 
in Figure 4-2 indicates that the computer is running Windows 7 Ultimate.
	
✓	What type of network card, if any, is installed in the computer: The 
easiest way to get this information is to right-click Computer on the 
Start menu, choose Manage, click Device Manager, right-click the net­
work adapter, and choose Properties. For example, Figure 4-3 shows the 
Properties dialog box for the network adapter that’s built into the moth­
erboard on my computer.
	
	Device Manager is also useful for tracking down other hardware devices 
attached to the computer, such as a mouse.

Scanner? External disk or tape drive? Video camera? Battle droid? Hot tub?
	
✓	Which driver and installation disks are available: Hopefully, you’ll be 
able to locate the disks or CDs required by hardware devices such as 
the network card, printers, scanners, and so on. If not, you may be able 
to locate the drivers on the Internet.
	
✓	What software is used on the computer: Microsoft Office? AutoCAD? 
QuickBooks? Make a complete list and include version numbers.
	
✓	Does the computer have wireless capability? Nearly all laptops do.

Programs that gather information for you
Gathering information about your computers is a lot of work if you have more 
than a few computers to network. Fortunately, several software programs 
are available that can automatically gather the information for you. These 
programs inspect various aspects of a computer, such as the CPU type and 
speed, amount of RAM, and the size of the computer’s hard drives. Then they 
show the information on the screen and give you the option of saving the 
information to a hard drive file or printing it.
Windows comes with just such a program, called Microsoft System Information. 
Microsoft System Information gathers and prints information about your 
computer. You can start Microsoft System Information by choosing Start➪All 
Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪System Information.
When you fire up Microsoft System Information, you see a window similar to 
the one shown in Figure 4-5. Initially, Microsoft System Information displays 
basic information about your computer, such as your version of Microsoft 
Windows, the processor type, the amount of memory on the computer, 
and so on. You can obtain more detailed information by clicking Hardware 
Resources, Components, or other categories in the left side of the window.

Part II: Setting Up a Network 
To Dedicate or Not to Dedicate: 
That Is the Question
One of the most basic questions that a network plan must answer is whether 
the network will have one or more dedicated servers or rely completely on 
peer-to-peer networking. If the only reason for purchasing your network is 
to share a printer and exchange an occasional file, you may not need a dedi­
cated server computer. In that case, you can create a peer-to-peer network 
by using the computers that you already have. However, all but the smallest 
networks will benefit from having a separate, dedicated server computer.
	
✓	Using a dedicated server computer makes the network faster, easier 
to work with, and more reliable. Consider what happens, though, when 
the user of a server computer that doubles as a workstation decides to 
turn off the computer, not realizing that someone else is accessing files 
on his hard drive.
	
✓	You don’t necessarily have to use your biggest and fastest computer 
as your server computer. I’ve seen networks where the slowest com­
puter on the network is the server. This advice is especially true when 
the server is mostly used to share a printer or to store a small number 
of shared files. So if you need to buy a computer for your network, con­
sider promoting one of your older computers to be the server and using 
the new computer as a client.
Assuming that your network will require one or more dedicated servers, you 
should next consider what types of servers the network will need. In some 
cases, a single server computer can fill one or more of these roles. Whenever 
possible, limit each server computer to a single server function.
File servers
File servers provide centralized disk storage that can be conveniently shared 
by client computers on the network. The most common task of a file server is to 
store shared files and programs. For example, members of a small workgroup 
can use disk space on a file server to store their Microsoft Office documents.
File servers must ensure that two users don’t try to update the same file at 
the same time. The file servers do this by locking a file while a user updates 
the file so that other users can’t access the file until the first user finishes. 
For document files (for example, word processing or spreadsheet files), the 
whole file is locked. For database files, the lock can be applied just to the 
portion of the file that contains the record or records being updated.

73
 Chapter 4: Planning a Network
Print servers
Sharing printers is one of the main reasons that many small networks exist. 
Although it isn’t necessary, a server computer can be dedicated for use as 
a print server, whose sole purpose is to collect information being sent to a 
shared printer by client computers and print it in an orderly fashion.
	
✓	A single computer may double as both a file server and a print server, but 
performance is better if you use separate print and file server computers.
	
✓	With inexpensive inkjet printers running about $100 each, just giving 
each user his or her own printer is tempting. However, you get what 
you pay for. Instead of buying $100 printers for 15 users, you may be 
better off buying one $1,500 laser printer and sharing it. The $1,500 laser 
printer will be much faster, will probably produce better-looking output 
and will be less expensive to operate.
Web servers
A web server is a server computer that runs software that enables the com­
puter to host an Internet website. The two most popular web server pro­
grams are Microsoft’s IIS (Internet Information Services) and Apache, an open 
source web server managed by the Apache Software Foundation.
Mail servers
A mail server is a server that handles the network’s e-mail needs. It is con­
figured with e-mail server software, such as Microsoft Exchange Server. 
Exchange Server is designed to work with Microsoft Outlook, the e-mail client 
software that comes with Microsoft Office.
Most mail servers actually do much more than just send and receive elec­
tronic mail. For example, here are some of the features that Exchange Server 
offers beyond simple e-mail:
	
✓	Collaboration features that simplify the management of collaborative 
projects.
	
✓	Audio and video conferencing.
	
✓	Chat rooms and instant messaging (IM) services.
	
✓	Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, which lets you develop customized 
forms for applications, such as vacation requests or purchase orders.

74
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Database servers
A database server is a server computer that runs database software, such as 
Microsoft’s SQL Server 2012. Database servers are usually used along with 
customized business applications, such as accounting or marketing systems.
Choosing a Server Operating System
If you determine that your network will require one or more dedicated serv­
ers, the next step is to determine what network operating system those 
servers should use. If possible, all the servers should use the same network 
operating system (NOS) so that you don’t find yourself supporting different 
operating systems.
Although you can choose from many network operating systems, from a 
practical point of view, your choices are limited to the following:
	
✓	Windows Server 2012 or 2008
	
✓	Linux or another version of Unix
For more information, see Chapter 10.
Planning the Infrastructure
You also need to plan the details of how you will connect the computers in 
the network. This task includes determining which network topology the net­
work will use, what type of cable will be used, where the cable will be routed, 
and what other devices (such as repeaters, bridges, hubs, switches, and rout­
ers) will be needed.
Although you have many cabling options to choose from, you’ll probably use 
Cat 5e or better UTP (unshielded twisted pair) for most — if not all — of the 
desktop client computers on the network. However, you have many decisions 
to make beyond this basic choice:
	
✓	Will you use hubs (less expensive) or switches (faster but more expensive)?
	
✓	Where will you place workgroup hubs or switches — on a desktop 
somewhere within the group or in a central wiring closet?
	
✓	How many client computers will you place on each hub or switch, and 
how many hubs or switches will you need?
	
✓	If you need more than one hub or switch, what type of cabling will you 
use to connect the hubs and switches to one another?

75
 Chapter 4: Planning a Network
For more information about network cabling, see Chapter 6.
	
If you’re installing new network cable, don’t scrimp on the cable itself. Because 
installing network cable is a labor-intensive task, the cost of the cable itself is 
a small part of the total cable installation cost. And if you spend a little extra 
to install higher-grade cable now, you won’t have to replace the cable in a few 
years when it’s time to upgrade the network.
Drawing Diagrams
One of the most helpful techniques for creating a network plan is to draw a 
picture of it. The diagram can be a detailed floor plan, showing the actual 
location of each network component. This type of diagram is sometimes 
called a “physical map.” If you prefer, the diagram can be a logical map, 
which is more abstract and Picasso-like. Any time you change the network 
layout, update the diagram. Also include a detailed description of the change, 
the date that the change was made, and the reason for the change.
You can diagram very small networks on the back of a napkin, but if the net­
work has more than a few computers, you’ll want to use a drawing program 
to help you create the diagram. One of the best programs for this purpose is 
Microsoft Visio, shown in Figure 4-6.
	
Figure 4-6: 
Using Visio 
to draw a 
network 
diagram.
	

76
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Here’s a rundown of some of the features that make Visio so useful:
	
✓	Smart shapes and connectors maintain the connections you’ve drawn 
between network components, even if you rearrange the layout of the 
components on the page.
	
✓	Stencils provide dozens of useful shapes for common network compo­
nents — not just for client and server computers, but for routers, hubs, 
switches, and just about anything else you can imagine. If you’re really 
picky about the diagrams, you can even purchase stencil sets that have 
accurate drawings of specific devices, such as Cisco routers or IBM 
mainframe computers.
	
✓	You can add information to each computer or device in the diagram, such 
as the serial number or physical location. Then, you can quickly print an 
inventory that lists this information for each device in the diagram.
	
✓	You can easily create large diagrams that span multiple pages.
Sample Network Plans
In what’s left of this chapter, I present some network plans that are drawn 
from real-life situations. These examples illustrate many of the network 
design issues I’ve covered so far in this chapter. The stories you’re about to 
read are true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.
Building a small network: California 
Sport Surface, Inc.
California Sport Surface, Inc. (CSS) is a small company specializing in the 
installation of outdoor sports surfaces, such as tennis courts, running tracks, 
and football fields. CSS has an administrative staff of just four employees who 
work out of a home office. The company currently has three computers:
	
✓	A brand-new Dell desktop computer running Windows 8, shared by the 
president (Mark) and vice president (Julie) to prepare proposals and 
marketing brochures, to handle correspondence, and to do other miscella­
neous chores. This computer has a built-in gigabit Ethernet network port.
	
✓	An older Gateway computer running Windows XP Home Edition, used by 
the bookkeeper (Erin), who uses QuickBooks to handle the company’s 
accounting needs. This computer has a built-in 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port.
	
✓	A notebook that runs Windows 7 Ultimate, used by the company’s chief 
engineer (Daniel), who often takes it to job sites to help with engineering 
needs. This computer has a built-in wireless networking and a gigabit 
Ethernet port.

77
 Chapter 4: Planning a Network
The company owns just one printer, a moderately priced inkjet printer that’s 
connected to Erin’s computer. The computers aren’t networked, so whenever 
Mark, Julie, or Daniel needs to print something, the file must be copied to a 
flash drive and given to Erin, who then prints the document. The computer 
shared by Mark and Julie is connected to the Internet via a residential DSL 
connection.
The company wants to install a network to support these three computers. 
Here are the primary goals of the network:
	
✓	Provide shared access to the printer so that users don’t have to exchange 
data on flash drives to print their documents.
	
✓	Provide shared access to the Internet connection so that users can 
access the Internet from any of the computers.
	
✓	Allow for the addition of another desktop computer, which the company 
expects to purchase within the next six months, and potentially another 
notebook computer. (If business is good, the company hopes to hire 
another engineer.)
	
✓	The network should be intuitive to the users and shouldn’t require 
extensive upkeep.
CSS’s networking needs can be met with the simple peer-to-peer network 
diagrammed in Figure 4-7.
	
Figure 4-7:

Surface’s

to-peer 
network.
	

78
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Here’s what the network requires:
	
✓	The network needs a combination DSL router and four-port gigabit 
network switch. The company may outgrow this device when it adds a 
laptop, but if and when that happens, another 4- or 8-port switch can be 
added at that time.
	
✓	The firewall features of the DSL router will need to be enabled to protect 
the network from Internet hackers.
	
✓	File and printer sharing will need to be activated on Erin’s computer, 
and the printer will need to be shared.
Connecting two networks: Creative 
Course Development, Inc.
Creative Course Development, Inc. (CCD) is a small educational publisher 
located in central California that specializes in integrated math and science 
curriculum for primary and secondary grades. It publishes a variety of course 
materials, including textbooks, puzzle books, and CD-ROM software.
CCD leases two office buildings that are adjacent to each other, separated only 
by a small courtyard. The creative staff, which consists of a dozen writers 
and educators, works in Building A. The sales, marketing, and administrative 
staff, which consists of six employees, works in Building B.
The creative staff (Building A) has a dozen relatively new personal computers, 
all running Windows Vista Business Edition, and a server computer running 
Windows 2003 Server. These computers are networked via a single 24-port 
gigabit network switch. A fractional T1 line that’s connected to the network 
through a small Cisco router provides Internet access.
The sales, marketing, and administrative staff (Building B) has a hodgepodge 
of computers, some running Windows 8 but most running Windows 7. They 
have a small Windows 2008 server that meets their needs. The older computers 
have 10/100BaseT network interfaces; the newer ones have gigabit interfaces. 
However, the computers are all connected to a 10/100 Mbps Ethernet switch 
with 12 ports. Internet access is provided by an ISDN connection.
Both groups are happy with their computers and networks. The problem is that 
the networks can’t communicate with each other. For example, the creative 
team in Building A prepares weekly product-development status reports to 
share with the Administrative staff in Building B, and they frequently go to 
the other building to look into important sales trends.

79
 Chapter 4: Planning a Network
Although several solutions to this problem exist, the easiest is to bridge the 
networks with a pair of wireless switches. To do this, CCD will purchase two 
wireless access points. One will be plugged into the gigabit switch in Building A, 
and the other will be plugged into the switch in Building B. After the access 
points are configured, the two networks will function as a single network. 
Figure 4-8 shows a logical diagram for the completed network.

ment’s

80
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Although the wireless solution to this problem sounds simple, a number of 
complications still need to be dealt with. Specifically:
	
✓	Depending on the environment, the wireless access points may have 
trouble establishing a link between the buildings. It may be necessary 
to locate the devices on the roof. In that case, CCD will have to spend a 
little extra money for weatherproof enclosures.
	
✓	Before the networks were connected, each network had its own DHCP 
server to assign IP addresses to users as needed. Unfortunately, both DHCP 
servers have the same local IP address (192.168.0.1). When the net­
works are combined, one of these DHCP servers will have to be disabled.
	
✓	In addition, both networks had their own Internet connections. With the 
networks bridged, CCD can eliminate the ISDN connection altogether. 
Users in both buildings can get their Internet access via the shared T1 
connection.
	
✓	The network administrator will also have to determine how to handle 
directory services for the network. Previously, each network had its own 
domain. With the networks bridged, CCD may opt to keep these domains 
separate, or it may decide to merge them into a single domain. (Doing so 
will require considerable work, so the company will probably leave the 
domains separate.)
Improving network performance: 
DCH Accounting
DCH Accounting is an accounting firm that has grown in two years from 15 
employees to 35, all located in one building. Here’s the lowdown on the exist­
ing network:
	
✓	The network consists of 35 client computers and three servers running 
Windows 2008 Server.
	
✓	The 35 client computers run a variety of Windows operating systems. 
About a third (a total of 11) run Windows Vista Professional. The rest run 
Windows XP Professional. None of the computers run Windows 7 or 8.
	
✓	The Windows Vista computers all have gigabit Ethernet cards. The older 
computers have 10/100 Mbps cards.

81
 Chapter 4: Planning a Network
	
✓	The server computers are somewhat older computers that have 10/100 
Mbps network interfaces.
	
✓	All the offices in the building are wired with Cat 5e wiring to a central wiring 
closet, where a small equipment rack holds two 24-port 10/100 switches.
	
✓	Internet access is provided through a T1 connection with a Cisco 1700 
router.
Lately, network performance has been noticeably slow, particularly Internet 
access and large file transfers between client computers and the servers. 
Users have started to complain that sometimes the network seems to crawl.
The problem is most likely that the network has outgrown the old 
10/100BaseT switches. All network traffic must flow through them, and 
they’re limited to the speed of 100 Mbps. As a result, the new computers with 
the gigabit Ethernet cards are connecting to the network at 100 Mbps.
The performance of this network can be dramatically improved in two steps. 
The first step is to replace the 10/100 Mbps network interface cards in the three 
servers with gigabit cards (or, better yet, replace the servers with newer 
models). Second, add a 24-port gigabit switch to the equipment rack. The 
equipment rack can be rewired, as shown in Figure 4-9.
	
1.	Connect the servers, the Cisco router, and the gigabit clients to the 
new gigabit switch. This will use 15 of the 24 ports.
	
2.	Connect the two 10/100 switches to the new gigabit switch. This will 
use two more ports, leaving 7 ports for future growth.
	
3.	Divide the remaining clients between the two 10/100 switches. Each 
switch will have 12 computers connected.
This arrangement connects all the gigabit clients to gigabit switch ports and 
100 Mbps clients to 100 Mbps switch ports.
	
For even better performance, DCH can simply replace both switches with 
24-port gigabit switches.

T

ransfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol — TCP/IP — is the basic 
protocol by which computers on a network talk to each other. Without 
TCP/IP, networks wouldn’t work. In this chapter, I introduce you to the most 
important concepts of TCP/IP.
	
This chapter is far and away the most technical chapter in this book. It helps 
you examine the binary system, the details of how IP addresses are con­
structed, how subnetting works, and how two of the most important TCP/IP 
services — Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name 
System (DNS) — work. You don’t need to understand every detail in this chapter 
to set up a simple TCP/IP network. However, the more you understand the infor­
mation in this chapter, the more TCP/IP will start to make sense. Be brave.
Understanding Binary
Before you can understand the details of how TCP/IP — in particular, IP — 
addressing works, you need to understand how the binary numbering system 
works because binary is the basis of IP addressing. If you already understand 
binary, please skip right over this section to the next main section, “Introducing 
IP Addresses.” I don’t want to bore you with stuff that’s too basic.

84
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Counting by ones
The binary counting system uses only two numerals: 0 and 1. In the decimal 
system to which most people are accustomed, you use ten numerals: 0 through 
9. In an ordinary decimal number, such as 3,482, the rightmost digit represents 
ones; the next digit to the left, tens; the next, hundreds; the next, thousands; 
and so on. These digits represent powers of ten: first 100 (which is 1); next, 101 
(10); then 102 (100); then 103 (1,000); and so on.
In binary, you have only two numerals rather than ten, which is why binary 
numbers look somewhat monotonous, as in 110011, 101111, and 100001.
The positions in a binary number (called bits rather than digits) represent 
powers of two rather than powers of ten: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. To figure 
the decimal value of a binary number, you multiply each bit by its corre­
sponding power of two and then add the results. The decimal value of binary 
10101, for example, is calculated as follows:
  1 × 20 = 1 ×  1 =   1
+ 0 × 21 = 0 ×  2 =   0
+ 1 × 22 = 1 ×  4 =   4
+ 0 × 23 = 0 ×  8 =   0
+ 1 × 24 = 1 × 16 = _16
                     21
Fortunately, a computer is good at converting a number between binary 
and decimal — so good, in fact, that you’re unlikely ever to need to do any 
conversions yourself. The point of knowing binary isn’t to be able to look at 
a number, such as 1110110110110, and say instantly, “Ah! Decimal 7,606!” (If 
you could do that, you would probably be interviewed on the Today show, 
and they would even make a movie about you.)
Instead, the point is to have a basic understanding of how computers store 
information and — most important — to understand how the hexadecimal 
counting system works (which I describe in the following section).
Here are some of the more interesting characteristics of binary and how the 
system is similar to and differs from the decimal system:
	
✓	The number of bits allotted for a binary number determines how large 
that number can be. If you allot eight bits, the largest value that number 
can store is 11111111, which happens to be 255 in decimal.
	
✓	To quickly determine how many different values you can store in a 
binary number of a given length, use the number of bits as an exponent 
of two. An eight-bit binary number, for example, can hold 28 values. 
Because 28 is 256, an 8-bit number can have any of 256 different values, 
which is why a byte, which is eight bits, can have 256 different values.

85
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
	
✓	This powers-of-two concept is why computers don’t use nice, even, 
round numbers in measuring such values as memory or disk space. A 
value of 1K, for example, isn’t an even 1,000 bytes — it’s 1,024 bytes 
because 1,024 is 210. Similarly, 1MB isn’t an even 1,000,000 bytes but 
rather is 1,048,576 bytes, which happens to be 220.
Doing the logic thing
One of the great things about binary is that it’s very efficient at handling spe­
cial operations called logical operations. Four basic logical operations exist, 
although additional operations are derived from the basic four operations. 
Three of the operations — AND, OR, and XOR — compare two binary digits 
(bits). The fourth (NOT) works on just a single bit.
The following list summarizes the basic logical operations:
	
✓	AND: An AND operation compares two binary values. If both values are 1, 
the result of the AND operation is 1. If one value is 0 or both of the values 
are 0, the result is 0.
	
✓	OR: An OR operation compares two binary values. If at least one of the 
values is 1, the result of the OR operation is 1. If both values are 0, the 
result is 0.
	
✓	XOR: An XOR operation compares two binary values. If exactly one of 
them is 1, the result is 1. If both values are 0 or if both values are 1, the 
result is 0.
	
✓	NOT: The NOT operation doesn’t compare two values. Instead, it simply 
changes the value of a single binary value. If the original value is 1, NOT 
returns 0. If the original value is 0, NOT returns 1.
	
	Logical operations are applied to binary numbers that have more than 
one binary digit by applying the operation one bit at a time. The easiest 
way to do this manually is to
	
1.	Line one of the two binary numbers on top of the other.
	
2.	Write the result of the operation beneath each binary digit.
	
	The following example shows how you calculate 10010100 AND 
11001101:
    10010100
AND 11001101
    10000100
	
	As you can see, the result is 10000100.

86
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Introducing IP Addresses
An IP address is a number that uniquely identifies every host on an IP net­
work. IP addresses operate at the Network layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack, 
so they’re independent of lower-level addresses, such as MAC addresses. 
(MAC stands for Media Access Control.)
IP addresses are 32-bit binary numbers, which means that theoretically, 
a maximum of something in the neighborhood of 4 billion unique host 
addresses can exist throughout the Internet. You’d think that’d be enough, 
but TCP/IP places certain restrictions on how IP addresses are allocated. 
These restrictions severely limit the total number of usable IP addresses, 
and about half of the total available IP addresses have already been assigned. 
However, new techniques for working with IP addresses have helped to alle­
viate this problem, and a new standard for 128-bit IP addresses (known as 
IPv6) is on the verge of winning acceptance.
Networks and hosts
The primary purpose of Internet Protocol (IP) is to enable communications 
between networks. As a result, a 32-bit IP address consists of two parts:
	
✓	The network ID (or network address): Identifies the network on which a 
host computer can be found
	
✓	The host ID (or host address): Identifies a specific device on the net­
work indicated by the network ID
Most of the complexity of working with IP addresses has to do with figur­
ing out which part of the complete 32-bit IP address is the network ID and 
which part is the host ID. The original IP specification uses the address 
classes system to determine which part of the IP address is the network ID 
and which part is the host ID. A newer system — classless IP addresses — is 
rapidly taking over the address classes system. You come to grips with both 
systems later in this chapter.
The dotted-decimal dance
IP addresses are usually represented in a format known as dotted-decimal 
notation. In dotted-decimal notation, each group of eight bits — an octet — is 
represented by its decimal equivalent. For example, consider the following 
binary IP address:
11000000101010001000100000011100

87
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
The dotted-decimal equivalent to this address is
192.168.136.28
Here, 192 represents the first eight bits (11000000); 168, the second set of 
eight bits (10101000); 136, the third set of eight bits (10001000); and 28, the 
last set of eight bits (00011100). This is the format in which you usually see 
IP addresses represented.
Classifying IP Addresses
When the original designers of the IP protocol created the IP addressing 
scheme, they could have assigned an arbitrary number of IP address bits for 
the network ID. The remaining bits would then be used for the host ID. For 
example, the designers may have decided that half of the address (16 bits) 
would be used for the network and the remaining 16 bits would be used for 
the host ID. The result of that scheme would be that the Internet could have a 
total of 65,536 networks, and each of those networks could have 65,536 hosts.
In the early days of the Internet, this scheme probably seemed like several 
orders of magnitude more than would ever be needed. However, the IP 
designers realized from the start that few networks would actually have tens 
of thousands of hosts. Suppose that a network of 1,000 computers joins the 
Internet and is assigned one of these hypothetical network IDs. Because that 
network uses only 1,000 of its 65,536 host addresses, more than 64,000 IP 
addresses would be wasted.
As a solution to this problem, the idea of IP address classes was introduced. 
The IP protocol defines five different address classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Each 
of the first three classes, A–C, uses a different size for the network ID and 
host ID portion of the address. Class D is for a special type of address called 
a multicast address. Class E is an experimental address class that isn’t used.
The first four bits of the IP address are used to determine into which class a 
particular address fits:
	
✓	If the first bit is 0, the address is a Class A address.
	
✓	If the first bit is 1 and the second bit is 0, the address is a Class B address.
	
✓	If the first two bits are both 1 and the third bit is 0, the address is a Class 
C address.
	
✓	If the first three bits are all 1 and the fourth bit is 0, the address is a 
Class D address.
	
✓	If the first four bits are all 1, the address is a Class E address.

Because Class D and E addresses are reserved for special purposes, I focus the 
rest of this discussion on Class A, B, and C addresses. Table 5-1 summarizes 
the details of each address class.

Class A addresses
Class A addresses are designed for very large networks. In a Class A address, 
the first octet of the address is the network ID, and the remaining three 
octets are the host ID. Because only eight bits are allocated to the network 
ID and the first of these bits is used to indicate that the address is a Class A 
address, only 126 Class A networks can exist in the entire Internet. However, 
each Class A network can accommodate more than 16 million hosts.
	
Only about 40 Class A addresses are assigned to companies or organiza­
tions. The rest are either reserved for use by the Internet Assigned Numbers 
Authority (IANA) or are assigned to organizations that manage IP assignments 
for geographic regions, such as Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
Just for fun, Table 5-2 lists some of the better-known Class A networks. You 
probably recognize many of them. In case you’re interested, you can find 
a complete list of all the Class A address assignments at www.iana.org/
assignments/ipv4-address-space.

Class B addresses
In a Class B address, the first two octets of the IP address are used as the 
network ID, and the second two octets are used as the host ID. Thus, a Class 
B address comes close to my hypothetical scheme of splitting the address 
down the middle, using half for the network ID and half for the host ID. It isn’t 
identical to this scheme, however, because the first two bits of the first octet 
are required to be 10, to indicate that the address is a Class B address. Thus, 
a total of 16,384 Class B networks can exist. All Class B addresses fall within 
the range 128.x.y.z to 191.x.y.z. Each Class B address can accommo­
date more than 65,000 hosts.
	
The problem with Class B networks is that even though they’re much smaller 
than Class A networks, they still allocate far too many host IDs. Very few net­
works have tens of thousands of hosts. Thus, the careless assignment of Class 
B addresses can lead to a large percentage of the available host addresses 
being wasted on organizations that don’t need them.

90
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Class C addresses
In a Class C address, the first three octets are used for the network ID, and 
the fourth octet is used for the host ID. With only eight bits for the host ID, 
each Class C network can accommodate only 254 hosts. However, with 24 
network ID bits, Class C addresses allow for more than 2 million networks.
	
The problem with Class C networks is that they’re too small. Although few 
organizations need the tens of thousands of host addresses provided by a 
Class B address, many organizations need more than a few hundred. The large 
discrepancy between Class B networks and Class C networks led to the devel­
opment of subnetting, which I describe in the next section.
Subnetting
Subnetting is a technique that lets network administrators use the 32 bits 
available in an IP address more efficiently by creating networks that aren’t 
limited to the scales provided by Class A, B, and C IP addresses. With subnet­
ting, you can create networks with more realistic host limits.
What about IPv6?
Most of the current Internet is based on version 4 of the Internet Protocol, also known as IPv4. 
IPv4 has served the Internet well for more than 20 years. However, the growth of the Internet has 
put a lot of pressure on IPv4’s limited 32-bit address space. This chapter describes how IPv4 has 
evolved to make the best possible use of 32-bit addresses, but eventually all the addresses will be 
assigned; the IPv4 address space will be filled to capacity. When that happens, the Internet will 
have to migrate to the next version of IP, known as IPv6.
IPv6 is also called IP next generation, or IPng, in honor of the favorite television show of most 
Internet gurus, Star Trek: The Next Generation.
IPv6 offers several advantages over IPv4, but the most important is that it uses 128 bits for Internet 
addresses rather than 32 bits. The number of host addresses possible with 128 bits is a number so 
large that it would make Carl Sagan proud. It doesn’t just double or triple the number of available 
addresses. Just for the fun of it, here’s the number of unique Internet addresses provided by IPv6:
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456
This number is so large that it defies understanding. If the IANA had been around at the creation of 
the universe and started handing out IPv6 addresses at a rate of one per millisecond, it would now, 
15 billion years later, have not yet allocated even 1 percent of the available addresses.
Unfortunately, the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 has been a slow one. Thus, the Internet will continue 
to be driven by IPv4 for at least a few more years.

91
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
Subnetting provides a more flexible way to designate which portion of an IP 
address represents the network ID and which portion represents the host ID. 
With standard IP address classes, only three possible network ID sizes exist: 
8 bits for Class A, 16 bits for Class B, and 24 bits for Class C. Subnetting lets 
you select an arbitrary number of bits to use for the network ID.
Two reasons compel me to use subnetting. The first is to allocate the limited 
IP address space more efficiently. If the Internet were limited to Class A, B, 
or C addresses, every network would be allocated 254, 65,000, or 16 million 
IP addresses for host devices. Although many networks with more than 254 
devices exist, few (if any) exist with 65,000, let alone 16 million. Unfortunately, 
any network with more than 254 devices would need a Class B allocation and 
probably waste tens of thousands of IP addresses.
The second reason for subnetting is that even if a single organization has 
thousands of network devices, operating all those devices with the same 
network ID would slow the network to a crawl. The way TCP/IP works dictates 
that all the computers with the same network ID must be on the same physical 
network. The physical network comprises a single broadcast domain, which 
means that a single network medium must carry all the traffic for the network. 
For performance reasons, networks are usually segmented into broadcast 
domains that are smaller than even Class C addresses provide.
Subnets
A subnet is a network that falls within another (Class A, B, or C) network. Subnets 
are created by using one or more of the Class A, B, or C host bits to extend 
the network ID. Thus, rather than the standard 8-, 15-, or 24-bit network ID, 
subnets can have network IDs of any length.
Figure 5-1 shows an example of a network before and after subnetting has 
been applied. In the unsubnetted network, the network has been assigned the 
Class B address 144.28.0.0. All the devices on this network must share the 
same broadcast domain.
In the second network, the first four bits of the host ID are used to divide 
the network into two small networks, identified as subnets 16 and 32. To the 
outside world (that is, on the other side of the router), these two networks 
still appear to be a single network identified as 144.28.0.0. For example, 
the outside world considers the device at 144.28.16.22 to belong to the 
144.28.0.0 network. As a result, a packet sent to this device is delivered to 
the router at 144.28.0.0. The router then considers the subnet portion of 
the host ID to decide whether to route the packet to subnet 16 or subnet 32.

92
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
Figure 5-1: 
A network

Subnet masks
For subnetting to work, the router must be told which portion of the host ID 
to use for the subnet’s network ID. This little sleight of hand is accomplished 
by using another 32-bit number, known as a subnet mask. Those IP address 
bits that represent the network ID are represented by a 1 in the mask, and 
those bits that represent the host ID appear as a 0 in the mask. As a result, a 
subnet mask always has a consecutive string of ones on the left, followed by 
a string of zeros.
For example, the subnet mask for the subnet, as shown in Figure 5-1, in which 
the network ID consists of the 15-bit network ID plus an additional 4-bit 
subnet ID, would look like this:
11111111 11111111 11110000 00000000
In other words, the first 20 bits are ones; the remaining 12 bits are zeros. Thus, 
the complete network ID is 20 bits in length, and the actual host ID portion of 
the subnetted address is 12 bits in length.
To determine the network ID of an IP address, the router must have both 
the IP address and the subnet mask. The router then performs a bitwise 
operation called a logical AND on the IP address to extract the network ID. 
To perform a logical AND, each bit in the IP address is compared to the cor­
responding bit in the subnet mask. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit in the 
network ID is set to 1. If either of the bits is 0, the resulting bit is set to 0.

93
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
For example, here’s how the network address is extracted from an IP address 
using the 20-bit subnet mask from the previous example:
                144  .    28  .    16  .   17
IP address:  10010000 00011100 00100000 00001001
Subnet mask: 11111111 11111111 11110000 00000000
Network ID:  10010000 00011100 00100000 00000000
                144  .    28  .    16  .    0
Thus, the network ID for this subnet is 144.28.16.0.
The subnet mask itself is usually represented in dotted-decimal notation. As 
a result, the 20-bit subnet mask used in the previous example would be repre­
sented as 255.255.240.0:
Subnet mask: 11111111 11111111 11110000 00000000
                255  .   255  .   240  .   0
	
Don’t confuse a subnet mask with an IP address. A subnet mask doesn’t repre­
sent any device or network on the Internet. It’s just a way of indicating which 
portion of an IP address should be used to determine the network ID. (You can 
spot a subnet mask right away because the first octet is always 255, and 255 
isn’t a valid first octet for any class of IP address.)
The great subnet roundup
You should know about a few additional restrictions that are placed on 
subnet masks — in particular:
	
✓	The minimum number of network ID bits is eight. As a result, the first 
octet of a subnet mask is always 255.
	
✓	The maximum number of network ID bits is 30. You have to leave at least 
two bits for the host ID portion of the address, to allow for at least two 
hosts. If you used all 32 bits for the network ID, that would leave no bits 
for the host ID. Obviously, that doesn’t work. Leaving just one bit for 
the host ID doesn’t work, either. That’s because a host ID of all ones is 
reserved for a broadcast address — and all zeros refers to the network 
itself. Thus, if you used 31 bits for the network ID and left only one for 
the host ID, host ID 1 would be used for the broadcast address and host 
ID 0 would be the network itself, leaving no room for actual hosts. That’s 
why the maximum network ID size is 30 bits.
	
✓	Because the network ID is always composed of consecutive bits set to 1, 
only nine values are possible for each octet of a subnet mask (including 
counting 0). For your reference, these values are listed in Table 5-3.

Private and public addresses
Any host with a direct connection to the Internet must have a globally unique 
IP address. However, not all hosts are connected directly to the Internet. 
Some are on networks that aren’t connected to the Internet. Some hosts are 
hidden behind firewalls, so their Internet connection is indirect.
Several blocks of IP addresses are set aside just for this purpose — for use on 
private networks that aren’t connected to the Internet or to use on networks 
hidden behind a firewall. Three such ranges of addresses exist, as summa­
rized in Table 5-4. Whenever you create a private TCP/IP network, use IP 
addresses from one of these ranges.

Understanding Network 
Address Translation
Many firewalls use a technique called network address translation (NAT) to 
hide the actual IP address of a host from the outside world. When that’s the 
case, the NAT device must use a globally unique IP to represent the host to 
the Internet; behind the firewall, however, the host can use any IP address it 
wants. As packets cross the firewall, the NAT device translates the private IP 
address to the public IP address, and vice versa.

95
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
One of the benefits of NAT is that it helps slow down the rate at which the 
IP address space is assigned because a NAT device can use a single public IP 
address for more than one host. It does this by keeping track of outgoing 
packets so that it can match up incoming packets with the correct host. To 
understand how this process works, consider this sequence of steps:
	
1.	 A host whose private address is 192.168.1.100 sends a request to 
74.125.226.1, which happens to be www.google.com. The NAT 
device changes the source IP address of the packet to 208.23.110.22, 
the IP address of the firewall. That way, Google will send its reply back 
to the firewall router. The NAT records that 192.168.1.100 sent a 
request to 74.125.226.1.
	
2.	 Now another host, at address 192.168.1.107, sends a request to 
64.4.11.37, which happens to be www.microsoft.com. The NAT 
device changes the source of this request to 208.23.110.22 so 
that Microsoft will reply to the firewall router. The NAT records that 
192.168.1.107 sent a request to 64.4.11.37.
	
3.	 A few seconds later, the firewall receives a reply from 74.125.226.1. 
The destination address in the reply is 208.23.110.22, the address 
of the firewall. To determine to whom to forward the reply, the firewall 
checks its records to see who’s waiting for a reply from 74.125.226.1. 
It discovers that 192.168.1.100 is waiting for that reply, so it changes 
the destination address to 192.168.1.100 and sends the packet on.
Actually, the process is a little more complicated than that because it’s very 
likely that two or more users may have pending requests from the same 
public IP. In that case, the NAT device uses other techniques to figure out to 
which user each incoming packet should be delivered.
Configuring Your Network for DHCP
Every host on a TCP/IP network must have a unique IP address. Each host 
must be properly configured so that it knows its IP address. When a new host 
comes online, it must be assigned an IP address within the correct range of 
addresses for the subnet — one that’s not already in use. Although you can 
manually assign IP addresses to each computer on your network, that task 
quickly becomes overwhelming if the network has more than a few computers.
That’s where Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) comes into play. 
DHCP automatically configures the IP address for every host on a network, thus 
ensuring that each host has a valid, unique IP address. DHCP even automatically 
reconfigures IP addresses as hosts come and go. As you can imagine, DHCP 
can save a network administrator many hours of tedious configuration work.
In this section, you discover the ins and outs of DHCP: what it is, how it works, 
and how to set it up.

96
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Understanding DHCP
DHCP allows individual computers on a TCP/IP network to obtain their con­
figuration information — in particular, their IP addresses — from a server. 
The DHCP server keeps track of which IP addresses have already been 
assigned so that when a computer requests an IP address, the DHCP servers 
offer it an IP address that isn’t already in use.
The alternative to DHCP is to assign each computer on your network a static 
IP address, which can be good or problematic:
	
✓	Static IP addresses are okay for networks with a handful of computers.
	
✓	For networks with more than a few computers, using static IP addresses 
is a huge mistake. Eventually, some poor, harried administrator (guess 
who?) will make the mistake of assigning two computers the same IP 
address. Then you have to manually check each computer’s IP address 
to find the conflict. DHCP is a must for any but the smallest networks.
Although the primary job of DHCP is to assign IP addresses, DHCP provides 
more configuration information than just the IP address to its clients. The 
additional configuration information is referred to as DHCP options. The fol­
lowing list describes some common DHCP options that can be configured by 
the server:
	
✓	Router address, also known as the default gateway address
	
✓	Expiration time for the configuration information
	
✓	Domain name
	
✓	DNS server address
	
✓	Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server address
DHCP servers
A DHCP server can be a server computer located on the TCP/IP network. 
Fortunately, all modern server operating systems have a built-in DHCP 
server capability. To set up DHCP on a network server, all you have to do is 
enable the server’s DHCP function and configure its settings. In the section 
“Managing a Windows Server 2012 DHCP Server,” later in this chapter, I show 
you how to configure a DHCP server for Windows 2012.
A server computer running DHCP doesn’t have to be devoted entirely to 
DHCP unless the network is very large. For most networks, a file server can 
share duty as a DHCP server, especially if you provide long leases for your IP 
addresses. (I explain the idea of leases later in this chapter.)

97
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
Most multifunction routers also have built-in DHCP servers. So if you don’t 
want to burden one of your network servers with the DHCP function, you can 
enable the router’s built-in DHCP server. An advantage of allowing the router 
to be your network’s DHCP server is that you rarely need to power down a 
router. By contrast, you occasionally need to restart or power down a file 
server to perform system maintenance, to apply upgrades, or to do some 
needed troubleshooting.
	
Most networks require only one DHCP server. Setting up two or more servers 
on the same network requires that you carefully coordinate the IP address 
ranges (known as scopes) for which each server is responsible. If you acciden­
tally set up two DHCP servers for the same scope, you may end up with dupli­
cate address assignments if the servers attempt to assign the same IP address 
to two different hosts. To prevent this situation from happening, set up just 
one DHCP server unless your network is so large that one server can’t handle 
the workload.
Understanding scopes
A scope is simply a range of IP addresses that a DHCP server is configured 
to distribute. In the simplest case, in which a single DHCP server oversees 
IP configuration for an entire subnet, the scope corresponds to the subnet. 
However, if you set up two DHCP servers for a subnet, you can configure 
each one with a scope that allocates only one part of the complete subnet 
range. In addition, a single DHCP server can serve more than one scope.
You must create a scope before you can enable a DHCP server. When you 
create a scope, you can provide it these properties:
	
✓	A scope name, which helps you identify the scope and its purpose.
	
✓	A scope description, which lets you provide additional details about the 
scope and its purpose.
	
✓	A starting IP address for the scope.
	
✓	An ending IP address for the scope.
	
✓	A subnet mask for the scope. You can specify the subnet mask with 
dotted decimal notation or with Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR) 
notation.
	
✓	One or more ranges of excluded addresses. These addresses aren’t 
assigned to clients. (For more information, see the section “Feeling 
excluded?,” later in this chapter.)
	
✓	One or more reserved addresses. These addresses are always assigned 
to particular host devices. (For more information, see the section 
“Reservations suggested,” later in this chapter.)

98
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
✓	The lease duration, which indicates how long the host is allowed to use 
the IP address. The client attempts to renew the lease when half of the 
lease duration has elapsed. For example, if you specify a lease duration 
of eight days, the client attempts to renew the lease after four days have 
passed. The host then has plenty of time to renew the lease before the 
address is reassigned to some other host.
	
✓	The router address for the subnet.
	
	This value is also known as the default gateway address.
	
✓	The domain name and the IP address of the network’s DNS servers and 
WINS servers.
Feeling excluded?
Everyone feels excluded once in a while. With a wife and three daughters, I 
know how that feels. Sometimes, however, being excluded is a good thing. In 
the case of DHCP scopes, exclusions can help you prevent IP address conflicts 
and can enable you to divide the DHCP workload for a single subnet among 
two or more DHCP servers.
An exclusion is a range of addresses not included in a scope but falling within 
the range of the scope’s starting and ending addresses. In effect, an exclusion 
range lets you punch a hole in a scope: The IP addresses that fall within the 
hole aren’t assigned.
Here are a couple of reasons to exclude IP addresses from a scope:
	
✓	The computer that runs the DHCP service itself must usually have 
a static IP address assignment. As a result, the address of the DHCP 
server should be listed as an exclusion.
	
✓	You may want to assign static IP addresses to your other servers. In 
that case, each server IP address should be listed as an exclusion.
	
	Reservations are often better solutions to this problem, as I describe in 
the next section.
Reservations suggested
In some cases, you may want to assign a specific IP address to a particular 
host. One way to do this is to configure the host with a static IP address so 
that the host doesn’t use DHCP to obtain its IP configuration. However, two 
major disadvantages to that approach exist:

99
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
	
✓	TCP/IP configuration supplies more than just the IP address. If you 
use static configuration, you must manually specify the subnet mask, 
default gateway address, DNS server address, and other configuration 
information required by the host. If this information changes, you have 
to change it not only at the DHCP server, but also at each host that you 
configured statically.
	
✓	You must remember to exclude the static IP address from the DHCP 
server’s scope. Otherwise, the DHCP server doesn’t know about the static 
address and may assign it to another host. Then comes the problem: 
You have two hosts with the same address on your network.
	
A better way to assign a fixed IP address to a particular host is to create a 
DHCP reservation. A reservation simply indicates that whenever a particular 
host requests an IP address from the DHCP server, the server should provide 
it the address that you specify in the reservation. The host doesn’t receive the 
IP address until the host requests it from the DHCP server, but whenever the 
host does request IP configuration, it always receives the same address.
To create a reservation, you associate the IP address that you want assigned 
to the host with the host’s MAC address. Accordingly, you need to get the 
MAC address from the host before you create the reservation:
	
✓	Usually, you can get the MAC address by running the command ipcon­
fig /all from a command prompt.
	
✓	If TCP/IP has not yet been configured on the computer, you can get the 
MAC address by choosing the System Information command:
	
	Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪System 
Information.
	
If you set up more than one DHCP server, be sure to specify the same reserva­
tions on each server. If you forget to repeat a reservation on one of the servers, 
that server may assign the address to another host.
How long to lease?
One of the most important decisions that you make when you configure a 
DHCP server is the length of time to specify for the lease duration. The default 
value is eight days, which is appropriate in many cases. However, you may 
encounter situations in which a longer or shorter interval may be appropriate:
	
✓	The more stable your network, the longer the lease duration can safely 
exist. If you only periodically add new computers to your network (or 
replace existing computers), you can safely increase the lease duration 
past eight days.

100
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
✓	The more volatile the network, the shorter the lease duration should be. 
For example, you may have a wireless network in a university library, 
used by students who bring their laptop computers into the library to 
work for a few hours at a time. For this network, a duration as short as 
one hour may be appropriate.
	
Don’t configure your network to allow leases of infinite duration. Although 
some administrators feel that this duration cuts down the workload for the 
DHCP server on stable networks, no network is permanently stable. Whenever 
you find a DHCP server that’s configured with infinite leases, look at the active 
leases. I guarantee that you’ll find IP leases assigned to computers that no 
longer exist.
Managing a Windows Server 
2012 DHCP Server
The exact steps to follow when you configure and manage a DHCP server 
depend on the network operating system or router you’re using. The following 
paragraphs describe how to work with a DHCP server in Windows Server 
2012. The procedures for other operating systems are similar.
If you haven’t already installed the DHCP server on the server, install it using 
the Server Manager (click Server Manager on the taskbar). Once the DHCP 
server role is installed, you can manage it by opening the DHCP management 
console, as shown in Figure 5-2. To open this console, open System Manager 
and choose Tools➪DHCP.

management 
console.

 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
To get started with a DHCP server, you must create at least one scope. You can 
create a scope by using the New Scope Wizard, which you start by selecting the 
server you want to create the scope on and then clicking New Scope. The wizard 
asks for the essential information required to define the scope, including the 
scope’s name, its starting and ending IP addresses, and the subnet mask. 
You can also specify any IP addresses you want to exclude from the scope, 
the lease duration (the default is eight days), the IP address of your gateway 
router, the domain name for your network, and the IP addresses for the DNS 
servers you want the client computers to use. Figure 5-3 shows the New 
Scope Wizard in action.

Wizard.
	
Configuring a Windows DHCP Client
Configuring a Windows client for DHCP is easy. The DHCP client is included 
automatically when you install the TCP/IP protocol, so all you have to do 
is configure TCP/IP to use DHCP. To do this, open the Network Properties 
dialog box by choosing Network or Network Connections in the Control Panel 
(depending on which version of Windows the client is running). Then select 
the TCP/IP protocol and click the Properties button. This action opens the 
TCP/IP Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-4. To configure the com­
puter to use DHCP, select the Obtain an IP Address Automatically and Obtain 
DNS Server Address Automatically options. Click OK, and you’re done.

Using DNS
DNS (Domain Name System) is the TCP/IP facility that lets you use names 
rather than numbers to refer to host computers. Without DNS, you’d buy 
books from 72.21.194.212 rather than from www.amazon.com, you’d sell 
your used furniture at 66.135.200.161 rather than on www.ebay.com, and 
you’d search the web at 74.125.224.147 rather than at www.google.com.
Understanding how DNS works and how to set up a DNS server is crucial to 
setting up and administering a TCP/IP network. The rest of this chapter intro­
duces you to the basics of DNS, including how the DNS naming system works 
and how to set up a DNS server.
Domains and domain names
To provide a unique DNS name for every host computer on the Internet, DNS 
uses a time-tested technique: divide and conquer. DNS uses a hierarchical 
naming system that’s similar to the way folders are organized hierarchi­
cally on a Windows computer. Instead of folders, however, DNS organizes its 
names into domains. Each domain includes all the names that appear directly 
beneath it in the DNS hierarchy.
For example, Figure 5-5 shows a small portion of the DNS domain tree. At the 
top of the tree is the root domain, which is the anchor point for all domains. 
Directly beneath the root domain are four top-level domains, named edu, com, 
org, and gov.

103
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
	
Figure 5-5: 
DNS names.
	
In reality, many more top-level domains than this exist in the Internet’s root 
domain. In fact, at the time I wrote this, there were more than 87 million of them.
Beneath the com domain in Figure 5-5 is another domain named LoweWriter, 
which happens to be my own personal domain. (Pretty clever, eh?) To 
completely identify this domain, you have to combine it with the name of 
its parent domain (in this case, com) to create the complete domain name: 
LoweWriter.com. Notice that the parts of the domain name are separated 
from each other by periods, which are pronounced “dot.” As a result, when 
you read this domain name, you should pronounce it “LoweWriter dot com.”
Beneath the LoweWriter node are four host nodes, named doug, kristen, 
server1, and printer1. These nodes correspond to three computers 
and a printer on my home network. You can combine the host name with 
the domain name to get the complete DNS name for each of my network’s 
hosts. For example, the complete DNS name for my server is server1.
LoweWriter.com. Likewise, my printer is printer1.LoweWriter.com.
Here are a few additional details that you need to remember about DNS names:
	
✓	DNS names aren’t case-sensitive. As a result, LoweWriter and 
Lowewriter are treated as the same name, as are LOWEWRITER, 
LOWEwriter, and LoWeWrItEr. When you use a domain name, you can 
use capitalization to make the name easier to read, but DNS ignores the 
difference between capital and lowercase letters.

104
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
✓	The name of each DNS node can be up to 63 characters long (not includ­
ing the dot) and can include letters, numbers, and hyphens. No other 
special characters are allowed.
	
✓	A subdomain is a domain that’s beneath an existing domain. For exam­
ple, the com domain is a subdomain of the root domain. Likewise, 
LoweWriter is a subdomain of the com domain.
	
✓	DNS is a hierarchical naming system that’s similar to the hierarchical 
folder system used by Windows. However, one crucial difference exists 
between DNS and the Windows naming convention. When you construct 
a complete DNS name, you start at the bottom of the tree and work your 
way up to the root. Thus, doug is the lowest node in the name doug.
LoweWriter.com. By contrast, Windows paths are the opposite: They 
start at the root and work their way down. For example, in the path 
\Windows\System32\dns, dns is the lowest node.
	
✓	The DNS tree can be up to 127 levels deep. However, in practice, the 
DNS tree is pretty shallow. Most DNS names have just three levels (not 
counting the root), and although you sometimes see names with four or 
five levels, you rarely see more levels than that.
	
✓	Although the DNS tree is shallow, it’s very broad. In other words, each of 
the top-level domains has a huge number of second-level domains imme­
diately beneath it. For example, at the time I wrote this book, the com 
domain had more than two million second-level domains beneath it.
Fully qualified domain names
If a domain name ends with a trailing dot, that trailing dot represents the 
root domain, and the domain name is said to be a fully qualified domain name 
(FQDN). A fully qualified domain name — also called an absolute name — is 
unambiguous because it identifies itself all the way back to the root domain. 
In contrast, if a domain name doesn’t end with a trailing dot, the name may 
be interpreted in the context of some other domain. Thus, DNS names that 
don’t end with a trailing dot are relative names.
This concept is similar to the way relative and absolute paths work in 
Windows. For example, if a path begins with a backslash, such as \Windows\
System32\dns, the path is absolute. However, a path that doesn’t begin 
with a backslash, such as System32\dns, uses the current folder as its 
starting point. If the current folder happens to be \Windows, \Windows\
System32\dns and System32\dns refer to the same location.
In many cases, relative and fully qualified domain names are interchangeable 
because the software that interprets them always interprets relative names in 
the context of the root domain. That’s why, for example, you can type www.
wiley.com — without the trailing dot — rather than www.wiley.com. to 

105
 Chapter 5: Dealing with TCP/IP
go to the Wiley home page in a web browser. Some applications, such as DNS 
servers, may interpret relative names in the context of a domain other than 
the root.
Working with the Windows DNS Server
The procedure for installing and managing a DNS server depends on the net­
work operating system you’re using. This section is specific to working with 
a DNS server in Windows 2008. Working with a DNS server in a Linux or Unix 
environment is similar but without the help of a graphical user interface.
You can install the DNS server on Windows Server 2012 from the Server 
Manager (choose Server Manager on the taskbar). After you install the DNS 
server, you can manage it from the DNS management console. Here, you 
can perform common administrative tasks, such as adding additional zones, 
changing zone settings, or adding new records an existing zone. The DNS 
management console hides the details of the resource records from you, thus 
allowing you to work with a friendly graphical user interface instead.
To add a new host (which is defined by a DNS record called an A record) 
to a zone, right-click the zone in the DNS management console and choose 
the Add New Host command. This action opens the New Host dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 5-6.
	
Figure 5-6: 
The New 
Host dialog 
box.
	
Here, you specify the following information:
	
✓	Name: The host name for the new host.
	
✓	IP Address: The host’s IP address.
	
✓	Create Associated Pointer (PTR) Record: Automatically creates a PTR 
record in the reverse lookup zone file. Select this option if you want to 

106
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
allow reverse lookups for the host. (A reverse lookup determines the 
domain name for a given IP address. It’s called that because the normal 
type of DNS lookup determines the IP address for a given domain name.)
	
✓	Allow Any Authenticated User to Update: Select this option if you want 
to allow other users to update this record or other records with the 
same host name. You should usually leave this option deselected.
	
✓	Time to Live: The TTL value for this record, which indicates how long 
(in seconds) the data should be cached.
You can add other records, such as MX records, in the same way.
Configuring a Windows DNS Client
Client computers don’t need much configuration to work properly with DNS. 
The client must have the address of at least one DNS server. Usually, this 
address is supplied by DHCP, so if the client is configured to obtain its IP 
address from a DHCP server, it also obtains the DNS server address from DHCP.
To configure a client computer to obtain the DNS server location from DHCP, 
open the Network Properties dialog box by choosing Network or Network 
Connections in the Control Panel (depending on which version of Windows 
the client is running). Then select the TCP/IP protocol and click the Properties 
button. This action summons the TCP/IP Properties dialog box, which is shown 
back in Figure 5-4. To configure the computer to use DHCP, select the Obtain 
an IP Address Automatically and the Obtain DNS Server Address Automatically 
options. Click OK, and you’re done.

C

able is the plumbing of your network. In fact, working with network 
cable is a lot like working with pipe: You have to use the right pipe 
(cable), the right valves and connectors (switches and routers), and the right 
fixtures (network interface cards).
And network cables have an advantage over pipes: You don’t get wet when 
they leak.
This chapter tells you far more about network cables than you probably need 
to know. I introduce you to Ethernet, the most common system of network 
cabling for small networks. Then you find out how to work with the cables 
used to wire an Ethernet network. You also find out how to install a network 
interface card (NIC), which enables you to connect the cables to your computer.
What Is Ethernet?
Ethernet is a standardized way of connecting computers to create a network.

108
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
You can think of Ethernet as a kind of municipal building code for networks: 
It specifies what kind of cables to use, how to connect the cables, how long 
the cables can be, how computers transmit data to one another by using the 
cables, and more.
	
Although Ethernet is now the overwhelming choice for networking, that wasn’t 
always the case. In ye olde days, Ethernet had two significant competitors:
Obligatory filler about network topology
A networking book wouldn’t be complete without 
the usual textbook description of the three basic 
network topologies. One type of network topol­
ogy is a bus, in which network nodes (that is, 
computers) are strung together in a line, like this:
A bus is the simplest type of topology, but it has 
some drawbacks. If the cable breaks some­
where in the middle, the whole network breaks.
A second type of topology is the ring:
A ring is very much like a bus except with no end 
to the line: The last node on the line is connected 
to the first node, forming an endless loop.
A third type of topology is a star:
In a star network, all the nodes are connected 
to a central hub. In effect, each node has an 
independent connection to the network, so a 
break in one cable doesn’t affect the others.
Ethernet networks are based on a bus design. 
However, fancy cabling tricks make an Ethernet 
network appear to be wired like a star when 
twisted-pair cable is used.

109
 Chapter 6: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Cables, Switches, and Routers
	
✓	Token Ring: This IBM standard for networking is still in some organiza­
tions (especially where IBM mainframe or midrange systems are in use).
	
✓	ARCnet: This standard is still commonly used for industrial network 
applications, such as building automation and factory robot control.
But these older networks are now pretty much obsolete, so you don’t need to 
worry about them. Ethernet is now the only real choice for new networks — 
small or large.
Here are a few tidbits you’re likely to run into at parties where the conversa­
tion is about Ethernet standards:
	
✓	Ethernet is a set of standards for the infrastructure on which a network 
is built. All the operating systems that I discuss in this book can operate 
on an Ethernet network. If you build your network on a solid Ethernet 
base, you can change network operating systems later.
	
✓	Ethernet is often referred to by network gurus as 802.3 (pronounced 
“eight-oh-two-dot-three”), which is the official designation used by the 
IEEE (pronounced “eye-triple-ee,” not “aieeee!”), a group of electrical 
engineers who wear bow ties and have nothing better to do than argue 
all day long about things like inductance and cross-talk — and it’s a 
good thing they do. If not for them, you couldn’t mix and match Ethernet 
components made by different companies.
	
✓	The original vintage Ethernet transmits data at a rate of 10 million bits 
per second, or 10 Mbps. (Mbps is usually pronounced “megabits per 
second.”) Because 8 bits are in a byte, that translates into roughly 1.2 
million bytes per second. In practice, Ethernet can’t move information 
that fast because data must be transmitted in packages of no more than 
1,500 bytes, called packets. So 150KB of information has to be split into 
100 packets.
	
	Ethernet’s transmission speed has nothing to do with how fast electrical 
signals move on the cable. The electrical signals travel at about 70 percent 
of the speed of light, or as Captain Kirk would say, “Warp factor point-
seven-oh.”
	
✓	A faster version of Ethernet, called 100 Mbps Ethernet or Fast Ethernet, 
moves data ten times as fast as normal Ethernet.
	
✓	The most common version of Ethernet today is gigabit Ethernet, which 
moves data at 1,000 Mbps.
	
✓	Most networking components that you can buy these days support 10, 
100 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps. These components are called 10/100/1000 
Mbps components.

Part II: Setting Up a Network 
All about Cable
Although you can use wireless technology to create networks without 
cables, most networks still use cables to physically connect each computer 
to the network. Over the years, various types of cables have been used with 
Ethernet networks. Almost all networks are now built with twisted-pair cable. 
In this type of cable, pairs of wires are twisted around each other to reduce 
electrical interference. (You almost need a PhD in physics to understand why 
twisting the wires helps to reduce interference, so don’t feel bad if this con­
cept doesn’t make sense.)
You may encounter other types of cable in an existing network; for example, 
on older networks, you may encounter two types of coaxial cable (also known 
as coax, pronounced “COE-ax”). The first type, which resembles television 
cable, is RG-58 cable. The second type is a thick, yellow cable that used to be 
the only type of cable used for Ethernet. You may also encounter fiber optic 
cables that span long distances at high speeds or thick twisted-pair bundles 
that carry multiple sets of twisted-pair cable between wiring closets in a large 
building. Most networks, however, use simple twisted-pair cable.
Twisted-pair cable is sometimes called UTP. (The U stands for unshielded, but 
“twisted-pair” is the standard name.) Figure 6-1 shows a twisted-pair cable.
	
Figure 6-1: 
Twisted-pair 
cable.
	
When you use UTP cable to construct an Ethernet network, you connect the 
computers in a star arrangement, as Figure 6-2 illustrates. In the center of this 
star is a switch. Depending on the model, Ethernet switches enable you to 
connect 4 to 48 computers (or more) by using twisted-pair cable. 
	
In the UTP star arrangement, if one cable goes bad, only the computer attached 
to that cable is affected. The rest of the network continues to chug along.
Cable categories
Twisted-pair cable comes in various grades: categories. These categories are 
specified by the ANSI/EIA Standard 568. (ANSI stands for American National 

111
 Chapter 6: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Cables, Switches, and Routers
Standards Institute; EIA stands for Electronic Industries Association). The 
standards indicate the data capacity — bandwidth — of the cable. Table 6-1 
lists the various categories of twisted-pair cable.
Although higher-category cables are more expensive, the real cost of installing 
Ethernet cabling is the labor required to pull the cables through the walls. 
You should never install anything less than Category (Cat) 5e cable. And if at 
all possible, invest in Cat 6 cable to allow for upgrades to your network.
	
To sound like the cool kids, say “Cat 6” rather than “Category 6.”

Part II: Setting Up a Network 
What’s with the pairs?
Most twisted-pair cable has four pairs of wires, for a total of eight wires. 
Standard Ethernet uses only two of the pairs, so the other two pairs are unused. 
You may be tempted to save money by purchasing cable with just two pairs 
of wires, but that’s a bad idea. If a network cable develops a problem, you can 
sometimes fix it by switching over to one of the extra pairs. If you use two-
pair cable, though, you don’t have any spare pairs to use.
	
Don’t use the extra pairs for some other purpose, such as a voice line or a 
second data line. The electrical “noise” in the extra wires can interfere with 
your network.
To shield or not to shield
Unshielded twisted-pair cable (UTP) is designed for normal office environments. 
When you use UTP cable, you must be careful not to route cable close to fluo­
rescent light fixtures, air conditioners, or electric motors (such as automatic 
door motors or elevator motors). UTP is the least expensive type of cable.
In environments that have a lot of electrical interference (such as factories), 
you may want to use shielded twisted-pair cable (STP). Because STP can be 
as much as three times more expensive than regular UTP, you don’t want to 
use STP unless you have to. With a little care, UTP can withstand the amount 
of electrical interference found in a normal office environment.
Most STP cable is shielded by a layer of aluminum foil. For buildings with 
unusually high amounts of electrical interference, the more expensive 
braided-copper shielding offers even more protection.
When to use plenum cable
The outer sheath of shielded and unshielded twisted-pair cable comes in two 
kinds:
	
✓	PVC: The most common and least expensive type.
	
✓	Plenum: A special type of fire-retardant cable designed for use in the 
plenum space (definition coming right up) of a building. Plenum cable 
has a special Teflon coating that not only resists heat, but also gives 
off fewer toxic fumes if it does burn. Unfortunately, plenum cable costs 
more than twice as much as ordinary PVC cable.

113
 Chapter 6: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Cables, Switches, and Routers
	
Most local building codes require plenum cable when the wiring is installed in 
the building’s plenum space (a compartment that’s part of the building’s air-
distribution system, usually the space above a suspended ceiling or under a 
raised floor).
	
The area above a suspended ceiling is not a plenum space if both the deliv­
ery and return lines of the air-conditioning and heating systems are ducted. 
Plenum cable is required only if the air-conditioning and heating systems 
aren’t ducted. When in doubt, have the local inspector look at your facility 
before you install cable.
Sometimes solid, sometimes stranded
The actual copper wire that makes up the cable comes in two varieties: solid 
and stranded. Your network will have some of each:
	
✓	Stranded: Each conductor is made from a bunch of very small wires that 
are twisted together. Stranded cable is more flexible than solid cable, so 
it doesn’t break as easily. However, stranded cable is more expensive 
than solid cable and isn’t very good at transmitting signals over long 
distances. Stranded cable is best used for patch cables (such as patch 
panels to hubs and switches).
	
	Strictly speaking, the cable that connects your computer to the wall jack 
is a station cable — not a patch cable — but it’s an appropriate use for 
stranded cable. (Although not technically correct, most people refer to 
the cable that connects a computer to a wall jack as a “patch cable.”)
	
✓	Solid: Each conductor is a single, solid strand of wire. Solid cable is less 
expensive than stranded cable and carries signals farther, but it isn’t very 
flexible. If you bend it too many times, it breaks. Typically, you find solid 
cable in use as permanent wiring within the walls and ceilings of a building.
Installation guidelines
The hardest part of installing network cable is the physical task of pulling the 
cable through ceilings, walls, and floors. This job is just tricky enough that I 
recommend you don’t attempt it yourself, except for small offices. For large 
jobs, hire a professional cable installer. You may even want to hire a profes­
sional for small jobs if the ceiling and wall spaces are difficult to access.
Keep these pointers in mind if you install cable yourself:
	
✓	You can purchase twisted-pair cable in prefabricated lengths, such as 
10, 15, or 20 feet. Longer lengths, such as 50 feet or 100 feet, are also 
available.

114
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
✓	Alternatively, you can purchase cable in bulk rolls, cut them to length, 
and attach the connectors yourself.
	
✓	Always use a bit more cable than you need, especially if you’re running 
cable through walls. For example, when you run a cable up a wall, leave 
a few feet of slack in the ceiling above the wall. That way, you have 
plenty of cable if you need to make a repair.
	
✓	When running cable, avoid sources of interference, such as fluorescent 
lights, big motors, X-ray machines, nuclear reactors, cyclotrons, or other 
gadgets you may have hidden in behind closed doors in your office.
	
	Fluorescent lights are the most common sources of interference for 
cables behind ceiling panels. Give light fixtures a wide berth. Three feet 
should do it.
	
✓	The maximum allowable cable length between the hub and the computer 
is 100 meters (about 328 feet).
	
✓	If you must run cable across the floor where people walk, cover the 
cable so no one trips over it. Cable protectors are available at most 
hardware stores.
	
✓	When running cables through walls, label each cable at both ends. Most 
electrical supply stores carry pads of cable labels that are perfect for 
the job. These pads contain 50 sheets or so of precut labels with letters 
and numbers. They look much more professional than wrapping a loop 
of masking tape around the cable and writing on the tape with a marker.
	
	Alternatively, you can just write directly on the label with a permanent 
marker.
	
✓	If you’re installing cable in new construction, label each end of the cable 
at least three times, leaving about a foot of space between the labels. 
The drywallers or painters will probably spray mud or paint all over 
your cables, making the labels difficult to find.
	
✓	When several cables come together, tie them with plastic cable ties. 
Avoid masking tape if you can; the tape doesn’t last, but the sticky glue 
stuff does. It’s a mess a year later. Cable ties are available at electrical 
supply stores.
	
✓	Cable ties have all sorts of useful purposes. Once, on a backpacking trip, 
I used a pair of cable ties to attach an unsuspecting buddy’s hat to a 
high tree limb. He wasn’t impressed with my innovative use of the cable 
ties, but my other hiking companions were.
	
✓	When you run cable above suspended ceiling panels, use cable ties, hooks, 
or clamps to secure the cable to the ceiling or to the metal frame that 
supports the ceiling tiles. Don’t just lay the cable on top of the panels.

115
 Chapter 6: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Cables, Switches, and Routers
The tools you need
Of course, to do a job right, you must have the right tools:
	
✓	Start with a basic set of computer tools, which you can get for about 
$15 from any computer store and most office-supply stores. These kits 
include socket wrenches and screwdrivers to open your computers and 
insert adapter cards.
	
	The computer tool kit probably contains everything you need if
 
• All your computers are in the same room.
 
• You’re running the cables along the floor.
 
• You’re using prefabricated cables.
	
	If you don’t have a computer tool kit, make sure that you have several 
flat-head and Phillips screwdrivers of various sizes.
	
✓	If you’re using bulk cable and plan on attaching your own connectors, you 
also need the following tools in addition to the basic computer tool kit:
 
• Wire cutters: You need big ones for coax; smaller ones work for 
twisted-pair cable. For yellow cable, you need the Jaws of Life.
 
• A crimp tool: You need the crimp tool to attach the connectors 
to the cable. Don’t use a cheap $25 crimp tool. A good crimp tool 
costs $100 and will save you many headaches in the long run.
	
	When you crimp, you mustn’t scrimp.
 
• Wire stripper: You need this tool only if the crimp tool doesn’t 
include a wire stripper.
	
✓	If you plan on running cables through walls, you need these additional 
tools:
 
• A hammer
 
• A keyhole saw: This one is useful if you plan on cutting holes 
through walls to route your cable.
 
• A flashlight
 
• A ladder
 
• Someone to hold the ladder
 
• Fish tape: Possibly. A fish tape is a coiled-up length of stiff metal 
tape. To use it, you feed the tape into one wall opening and fish it 
toward the other opening, where a partner is ready to grab it when 
the tape arrives. Next, your partner attaches the cable to the fish 
tape and yells something like “Let ’er rip!” or “Bombs away!” Then 
you reel in the fish tape and the cable along with it. (You can find 
fish tape in the electrical section of most well-stocked hardware 
stores.)

If you plan on routing cable through a concrete subfloor, you need to rent a 
jackhammer and a backhoe and then hire someone to hold a yellow flag while 
you work. Better yet, find some other route for the cable.
Pinouts for twisted-pair cables
Each pair of wires in a twisted-pair cable is one of four colors: orange, green, 
blue, or brown. The two wires that make up each pair are complementary: 
one is white with a colored stripe; the other is colored with a white stripe. 
For example, the orange pair has an orange wire with a white stripe (the 
orange wire) and a white wire with an orange stripe (the white/orange wire). 
Likewise, the blue pair has a blue wire with a white stripe (the blue wire) and 
a white wire with a blue stripe (the white/blue wire).
When you attach a twisted-pair cable to a modular connector or jack, you 
must match up the right wires to the right pins. It’s harder than it sounds; 
you can use any of several different standards to wire the connectors. To 
confuse matters further, you can use one of the two popular standard ways 
of hooking up the wires: EIA/TIA 568A or EIA/TIA 568B, also known as AT&T 
258A. Both of these wiring schemes are shown in Table 6-2.
	
It doesn’t matter which of these wiring schemes you use, but pick one and 
stick with it. If you use one wiring standard on one end of a cable and the 
other standard on the other end, the cable doesn’t work.

Ethernet only uses two of the four pairs, connected to Pins 1, 2, 3, and 6. One 
pair transmits data; the other receives data. The only difference between the 
two wiring standards is which pair transmits and which receives. In the EIA/
TIA 568A standard, the green pair is used for transmit, and the orange pair is 
used for receive. In the EIA/TIA 568B and AT&T 258A standards, the orange 
pair is used for transmit and the green pair for receive.

117
 Chapter 6: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Cables, Switches, and Routers
If you want, you can get away with connecting only Pins 1, 2, 3, and 6. 
However, I suggest that you connect all four pairs, as indicated in Table 6-2.
RJ-45 connectors
RJ-45 connectors for twisted-pair cables aren’t too difficult to attach if you 
have the right crimping tool. The only trick is making sure that you attach 
each wire to the correct pin and then press the tool hard enough to ensure a 
good connection.
Here’s the procedure for attaching an RJ-45 connector:
	
1.	Cut the end of the cable to the desired length.
	
	 Make sure that you make a square cut — not a diagonal cut.
	
2.	Insert the cable into the stripper portion of the crimp tool so that the 
end of the cable is against the stop.
	
	 Squeeze the handles and slowly pull out the cable, keeping it square. 
This strips off the correct length of outer insulation without puncturing 
the insulation on the inner wires.
	
3.	Arrange the wires so that they lie flat and line up according to Table 6-2.
	
	 You have to play with the wires a little bit to get them to lay out in the 
right sequence.
	
4.	Slide the wires into the pinholes on the connector.
	
	Double-check to make sure all the wires are slipped into the correct 
pinholes.
	
5.	Insert the plug and wire into the crimping portion of the tool and then 
squeeze the handles to crimp the plug.
	
	 Squeeze it tight!
	
6.	Remove the plug from the tool and double-check the connection.
	
	 You’re done!
Here are a few other points to remember when dealing with RJ-45 connectors 
and twisted-pair cable:
	
✓	The pins on the RJ-45 connectors aren’t numbered.
	
	You can tell which is Pin 1 by holding the connector so that the metal 
conductors are facing up, as shown in Figure 6-3. Pin 1 is on the left.

118
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
Figure 6-3: 
Attaching 
an RJ-45 
connector 
to twisted-
pair cable.
	
	
✓	Some people wire the cable differently — using the green-and-white pair 
for Pins 1 and 2, and the orange-and-white pair for Pins 3 and 6. Doing 
it this way doesn’t affect the operation of the network (the network is 
color blind) as long as the connectors on both ends of the cable are wired 
the same way!
	
✓	When you attach the connectors, don’t untwist more than half an inch 
of cable. And, don’t try to stretch the cable runs beyond the 100-meter 
maximum. When in doubt, have the cable professionally installed.
Crossover cables
A crossover cable can directly connect two devices without a hub or switch. 
You can use a crossover cable to connect two computers directly to each 
other, but crossover cables are more often used to daisy-chain hubs and 
switches to each other.
If you want to create your own crossover cable, you must reverse the wires 
on one end of the cable, as shown in Table 6-3. This table shows how you 
should wire both ends of the cable to create a crossover cable. Connect one 
of the ends according to the Connector A column and the other according to 
the Connector B column.
Note that you don’t need to use a crossover cable if one of the switches or 
hubs that you want to connect has a crossover port, usually labeled Uplink or 
Daisy-chain. If the hub or switch has an Uplink port, you can daisy-chain it by 
using a normal network cable. For more information about daisy-chaining hubs 
and switches, see the section “Daisy-Chaining Switches,” later in this chapter.
	
If you study Table 6-3 long enough and then compare it with Table 6-2, you 
may notice that a crossover cable is a cable that’s wired according to the 568A 
standard on one end and the 568B standard on the other end.

Wall jacks and patch panels
If you want, you can run a single length of cable from a network hub or switch 
in a wiring closet through a hole in the wall, up the wall to the space above 
the ceiling, through the ceiling space to the wall in an office, down the wall, 
through a hole, and all the way to a desktop computer. That’s not a good 
idea. For example, every time someone moves the computer or even cleans 
behind it, the cable will get moved a little bit. Eventually, the connection will 
fail, and the RJ-45 plug will have to be replaced. Then the cables in the wiring 
closet will quickly become a tangled mess.
The alternative is to put a wall jack in the wall at the user’s end of the cable 
and connect the other end of the cable to a patch panel. Then the cable itself 
is completely contained within the walls and ceiling spaces. To connect a 
computer to the network, you plug one end of a patch cable (properly called 
a station cable) into the wall jack and plug the other end into the computer’s 
network interface. In the wiring closet, you use a patch cable to connect the 
wall jack to the network hubs or switches. Figure 6-4 shows how this arrange­
ment works.
Connecting a twisted-pair cable to a wall jack or a patch panel is similar to 
connecting it to an RJ-45 plug. However, you don’t usually need any special 
tools. Instead, the back of the jack has a set of slots that you lay each wire 
across. You then snap a removable cap over the top of the slots and press 
it down. This action forces the wires into the slots, where little metal blades 
pierce the insulation and establish the electrical contact.
	
When you connect the wire to a jack or a patch panel, be sure to untwist as 
little of the wire as possible. If you untwist too much of the wire, the signals 
that pass through the wire may become unreliable.

Using wall 
jacks and 
patch  
panels.
	
Working with Switches
When you use twisted-pair cable to wire a network, you don’t plug the com­
puters into each other. Instead, each computer plugs into a separate device 
called a switch.
You need to know only a few details when working with switches. Here they are:
	
✓	Installing a switch is usually very simple. Just plug in the power cord 
and then plug in patch cables to connect the network.
	
✓	Each port on the switch has an RJ-45 jack and a single LED indicator, 
labeled Link, that lights up when a connection is made on the port.
	
	If you plug one end of a cable into the port and the other end into a 
computer or other network device, the Link light should come on. If it 
doesn’t, something is wrong with the cable, the hub or switch port, or 
the device on the other end of the cable.

121
 Chapter 6: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Cables, Switches, and Routers
	
✓	Each port may have an LED indicator that flashes to indicate network 
activity.
	
	If you stare at a switch for a while, you can find out who uses the network 
most by noting which activity indicators flash the most.
	
✓	The ports may also have a collision indicator that flashes whenever a 
packet collision occurs on the port.
	
	It’s perfectly acceptable for the collision indicator to flash now and then, 
but if it flashes a lot, you may have a problem with the network:
 
• Usually, the flashing means that the network is overloaded and 
should be segmented with a switch to improve performance.
 
• In some cases, the flashing may be caused by a faulty network 
node that clogs the network with bad packets.
Daisy-Chaining Switches
If a single switch doesn’t have enough ports for your entire network, you can 
connect switches by daisy-chaining them, as shown in Figure 6-5. 
	
You can often increase the overall performance of your network by using 
two (or more) connections between switches. For example, you may use two 
patch cables to create two connections between a pair of switches.
	
Don’t chain more than two switches together. If you do, the network may not 
transmit your data reliably. However, you can get around this rule by using 
stackable switches (switches with a special cable connector that connects two 
or more switches so that they function as a single switch). Stackable switches 
are musts for large networks.
	
If your building is prewired and has a network jack near each desk, you can 
use a small switch to connect two or more computers to the network by using 
a single jack. Just use one cable to plug the daisy-chain port of the hub into 
the wall jack and then plug each computer into one of the hub’s ports.

Figure 6-5: 
You can 
daisy-chain 
switches 
together.
	
Using a Router
A router is a device that is capable of passing data between two networks. 
The most common reason for using a router is to connect a LAN to the 
Internet. However, routers can perform many other functions as well. For 
example, a router can filter data based on its content, allowing some types of 
data to pass through while blocking other types. 
	
You can configure a network with several routers that can work cooperatively. 
For example, some routers can monitor the network to determine the most 
efficient path for sending a message to its ultimate destination. If a part of the 
network is extremely busy, a router can automatically route messages along 
a less-busy route. In this respect, the router is kind of like a traffic reporter 

123
 Chapter 6: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Cables, Switches, and Routers
flying in a helicopter. The router knows that the 101 is bumper to bumper all 
the way through Sunnyvale, so it sends the message on the 280 instead.
Here’s some additional information about routers:
	
✓	Routers used to be expensive and used only on large networks. 
However, the price of small routers has dropped substantially in recent 
years, so they’re now becoming common even on small networks.
	
✓	The functional distinctions between bridges and routers — and switches 
and hubs, for that matter — get blurrier all the time. Multifunction routers 
(which combine the functions of routers, bridges, hubs, and switches) 
are often used to handle some chores that used to require separate 
devices.
	
✓	A pair of routers can be used to create a secure connection between two 
locations that are geographically distant from each other.
	
✓	One of the main reasons for using routers is to connect a LAN to the 
Internet. Figure 6-6 shows a router used for this purpose.

efore your network setup is complete, you must configure the network’s 
client computers. In particular, you have to configure each client com­
puter’s network interface card (NIC) so that it works properly, and you have 
to install the right protocols so that the clients can communicate with other 
computers on the network.
Fortunately, the task of configuring client computers for the network is 
child’s play in Windows. For starters, Windows automatically recognizes your 
network interface card when you start up your computer. All that remains 
is to make sure that Windows properly installed the network protocols and 
client software.
With each version of Windows, Microsoft has simplified the process of config­
uring client network support. In this chapter, I describe the steps for configur­
ing networking for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.
Configuring Network Connections
Windows usually detects the presence of a network adapter automatically; 
typically, you don’t have to install device drivers manually for the adapter. 
When Windows detects a network adapter, it automatically creates a network 
connection and configures it to support basic networking protocols. You may 
need to change the configuration of a network connection manually, however. 
The procedures for Windows XP and Vista are described in the following 
sections.

126
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Configuring Windows XP 
network connections
The following steps show how to configure your network connection on a 
Windows XP system:
	
1.	Choose Start➪Control Panel to open the Control Panel.
	
2.	Double-click the Network Connections icon.
	
	 The Network Connections folder appears, as shown in Figure 7-1.
	
Figure 7-1: 
The 
Network 
Connections 
folder.
	
	
3.	Right-click the connection that you want to configure and then choose 
Properties from the contextual menu that appears.
	
	 Either way, the Properties dialog box for the network connection 
appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
	
4.	To configure the network adapter settings, click Configure.
	
	 This action summons the Properties dialog box for the network adapter, 
as shown in Figure 7-3. This dialog box has five tabs that let you config­
ure the NIC:
 
• General: This tab shows basic information about the NIC, such 
as the device type and status. For example, the device shown in 
Figure 7-3 is an Intel Pro 100 network interface. 

127
 Chapter 7: Configuring Windows Clients
	
Figure 7-2: 
The 
Properties 
dialog 
box for a

connection.
	
 
• Advanced: From this tab, you can set a variety of device-specific 
parameters that affect the operation of the NIC. In most cases, you 
should leave the options on this tab alone.
 
• Driver: This tab displays information about the device driver that’s 
bound to the NIC and lets you update the driver to a newer version, 
roll back the driver to a previously working version, or uninstall 
the driver.
	
Figure 7-3:

128
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
 
•	Resources: From this tab, you can use manual settings to limit the 
system resources used by the card. In most cases, you can leave 
the settings on this tab alone.
	
	In the old days, before Plug and Play cards, you had to configure 
these settings whenever you installed a card, and it was easy to 
create resource conflicts. Windows configures these settings auto­
matically so that you should rarely need to fiddle with them.
	
• Power Management: From this tab, you set power-management 
options. You can specify that the network card be shut down when­
ever the computer goes into sleep mode and that the computer 
wake up periodically to refresh its network state.
	
	 When you click OK to dismiss the network adapter’s Properties dialog box, 
the network connection’s Properties dialog box closes. Select the Change 
Settings of This Connection option again to continue the procedure.
	
5.	Click Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and then click Properties to display 
the TCP/IP Properties dialog box. Adjust the settings and then click OK.
	
	The TCP/IP Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 7-4, lets you choose 
among these options:
 
• Obtain an IP Address Automatically: Choose this option if your net­
work has a DHCP server that assigns IP addresses automatically. 
Choosing this option dramatically simplifies administering TCP/
IP on your network. (See Chapter 5 for more information about 
DHCP.)
 
• Use the Following IP Address: If your computer must have a specific 
IP address, choose this option and then type the computer’s IP 
address, subnet mask, and default gateway address. (For more 
information about these settings, see Chapter 5.)
 
• Obtain DNS Server Address Automatically: The DHCP server can also 
provide the address of the Domain Name System (DNS) server that 
the computer should use. Choose this option if your network has a 
DHCP server. (See Chapter 5.)
 
• Use the Following DNS Server Addresses: Choose this option if a DNS 
server isn’t available. Then type the IP addresses of the primary 
and secondary DNS servers.

Configuring Windows Vista 
network connections
The procedure for configuring a network connection on Windows Vista is 
similar to the procedure for Windows XP, except that Microsoft decided to 
bury the configuration dialog boxes a little deeper in the bowels of Windows.
To find the settings you need, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Start➪Control Panel.
	
2.	Choose View Network Status and Tasks under the Network and 
Internet heading.
	
	This step opens the Network and Sharing Center, shown in Figure 7-5.
	
3.	Click Manage Network Connections.
	
	 The Network Connections folder appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.

	 From this point, the steps for configuring the network connection are 
the same as they are for Windows XP. As a result, you can continue by 
beginning with Step 4 in the preceding section, “Configuring Windows 
XP network connections.”
Configuring Windows 7 and Windows 8 
network connections
The procedure for configuring a Windows 7 network connection is similar to 
the Windows Vista procedure, with just a few minor variations. Here are the 
steps:
	
1.	Open the Control Panel.
 
• Windows 7: Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
• Windows 8: Right-click the bottom-left corner of the screen and 
then choose Control Panel from the contextual menu.
	
2.	Choose Network and Sharing Center.
	
	This step opens the Network and Sharing Center, shown in Figure 7-8.

	 From this point, the steps for configuring the network connection are 
the same as they are for Windows XP. As a result, you can continue by 
beginning with Step 4 in the earlier section “Configuring Windows XP 
network connections.”
Configuring Client Computer 
Identification
Every client computer must identify itself to participate in the network. 
The computer identification consists of the computer’s name, an optional 
description, and the name of either the workgroup or the domain to which 
the computer belongs.
The computer name must follow certain rules: It may be 1 to 15 characters 
long and may contain letters, numbers, or hyphens but no spaces or periods. 
For small networks, it’s common to make the computer name the same as the 
username. For larger networks, you may want to develop a naming scheme 

134
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
that identifies the computer’s location. A name such as C-305-1 may be 
assigned to the first computer in Room 305 of Building C, for example, or 
MKTG010 may be a computer in the Marketing department.
If the computer will join a domain, you need to have access to an Administrator 
account on the domain unless the administrator has already created a 
computer account on the domain. Note that only the following versions of 
Windows have the capability to join a domain:
	
✓	Windows 8 Professional and Enterprise
	
✓	Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate
	
✓	Windows Vista Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate
	
✓	Windows XP Professional
When you install Windows on the client system, the Setup program asks for 
the computer name and workstation or domain information. You can change 
this information later, if you want. The procedure varies depending on the 
Windows version you’re using.
Configuring Windows XP 
computer identification
To change the computer identification in Windows XP, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Control Panel (Start➪Control Panel) and then double-click 
the System icon to open the System Properties dialog box.
	
2.	Click the Computer Name tab.
	
	The computer identification information is displayed.
	
3.	Click the Change button.
	
	 This step displays the Computer Name Changes dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 7-11.
	
4.	Type the new computer name and then specify the workgroup or 
domain information.
	
	To join a domain, select the Domain radio button and type the domain 
name in the appropriate text box. To join a workgroup, select the 
Workgroup radio button and type the workgroup name in the corre­
sponding text box.
	
5.	Click OK.

hasn’t already been created for the client computer.
	
8.	When a dialog box appears, informing you that you need to restart the 
computer, click OK; then restart the computer.
	
	 The computer is added to the domain or workgroup.
Configuring Network Logon
Every user who wants to access a domain-based network must log on to the 
domain by using a valid user account. The user account is created on the 
domain controller — not on the client computer.

Network logon isn’t required to access workgroup resources. Instead, work­
group resources can be password-protected to restrict access.
When you start a Windows computer that’s been configured to join a domain, 
as described in the section “Configuring Client Computer Identification,” earlier 
in this chapter, the Log on to Windows dialog box is displayed. The user can 
use this dialog box to log on to a domain by entering a domain username and 
password and then selecting the domain that she wants to log on to (from 
the Log on To drop-down list).
	
You can create local user accounts in Windows that allow users to access 
resources on the local computer. To log on to the local computer, the user 
selects This Computer from the Log on To drop-down list and enters the user­
name and password for a local user account. When a user logs on by using a 
local account, he isn’t connected to a network domain. To log on to a domain, 
the user must select the domain from the Log on To drop-down list.
If the computer isn’t part of a domain, Windows can display a friendly logon 
screen that displays an icon for each of the computer’s local users. The user 
can log on simply by clicking the appropriate icon and entering a password. 
(This feature isn’t available for computers that have joined a domain.)
Note that if the user logs on by using a local computer account rather than a 
domain account, she can still access domain resources. A Connect To dialog 
box appears whenever the user attempts to access a domain resource. Then 
the user can enter a domain username and password to connect to the 
domain.

S

o you decided to connect your network to the Internet. All you have to 
do is call the cable company and have them send someone out, right? 
Wrong. Unfortunately, connecting to the Internet involves more than just call­
ing the cable company. For starters, you have to make sure that cable is the 
right way to connect. Then you have to select and configure the software you 
use to access the Internet. Finally, you have to lie awake at night worrying 
whether hackers are breaking into your network via its Internet connection.
Not to worry. The advice in this chapter helps you decide how to connect to 
the Internet and, once the decision is made, how to do it safely.
Connecting to the Internet
Connecting to the Internet isn’t free. For starters, you have to purchase the 
computer equipment necessary to make the connection. Then you have to 
obtain a connection from an Internet service provider (ISP). The ISP charges 
you a monthly fee that depends on the speed and capacity of the connection.
The following sections describe the most commonly used methods of connect­
ing network users to the Internet.

140
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Connecting with cable or DSL
For small and home offices, the two most popular methods of connecting to 
the Internet are cable and digital subscriber line (DSL). Cable and DSL con­
nections are often called broadband connections for technical reasons you 
don’t really want to know.
Cable Internet access works over the same cable that brings 40 billion TV 
channels into your home, whereas DSL is a digital phone service that works 
over a standard phone line. Both offer three major advantages over old-
fashioned dialup connections:
	
✓	Cable and DSL are much faster than dialup connections.
	
	A cable connection can be anywhere from 10 to 200 times faster than a 
dialup connection, depending on the service you get. And the speed of 
a DSL line is comparable with cable. (Although DSL is a dedicated con­
nection, cable connections are shared among several subscribers. The 
speed of a cable connection may slow down when several subscribers 
use the connection simultaneously.)
	
✓	With cable and DSL, you’re always connected to the Internet.
	
	You don’t have to connect and disconnect each time you want to go online 
like you would if you use a modem. No more waiting for the modem to 
dial your service provider and listening to the annoying modem shriek 
while it attempts to establish a connection.
	
✓	Cable and DSL don’t tie up a phone line while you’re online.
	
	With cable, your Internet connection works over TV cables, not over 
phone cables. With DSL, the phone company installs a separate phone 
line for the DSL service, so your regular phone line isn’t affected.
Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and the high-speed, 
always-on connections offered by cable and DSL don’t come without a price. 
For starters, you can expect to pay a higher monthly access fee for cable or 
DSL. In most areas of the United States, cable runs about $50 per month for 
residential users; business users can expect to pay more, especially if more 
than one user will be connected to the Internet via the cable.
The cost for DSL service depends on the access speed you choose. In some 
areas, residential users can get a relatively slow DSL connection for as little 
as $30 per month. For higher access speeds or for business users, DSL can 
cost substantially more.
Too, cable and DSL access aren’t available everywhere. But if you live in an 
area where cable or DSL isn’t available, you can still get high-speed Internet 
access by using a satellite hookup or a cellular network.

141
 Chapter 8: Connecting Your Network to the Internet
Connecting with high-speed private lines
If your network is large and high-speed Internet access is a high priority, 
contact your local phone company (or companies) about installing a dedi­
cated high-speed digital line. These lines can cost you plenty (on the order of 
hundreds of dollars per month), so they’re best suited for large networks in 
which 20 or more users are accessing the Internet simultaneously.
The following paragraphs describe three basic options for high-speed private 
lines:
	
✓	T1 and T3 lines: T1 and T3 lines run over standard copper phone lines. 
A T1 line has a connection speed of up to 1.544 Mbps. A T3 line is faster 
yet: It transmits data at an amazing 44.184 Mbps. Of course, T3 lines are 
also considerably more expensive than T1 lines.
	
	If you don’t have enough users to justify the expense of an entire T1 or 
T3 line, you can lease just a portion of the line. With a fractional T1 line, 
you can get connections with speeds of 128 Kbps to 768 Kbps; with a 
fractional T3 line, you can choose speeds ranging from 4.6 Mbps to 32 Mbps.
	
	You may be wondering whether T1 or T3 lines are really any faster than 
cable or DSL connections. After all, T1 runs at 1.544 Mbps and T3 runs 
at 44.184 Mbps, and cable and DSL claim to run at comparable speeds. 
But there are many differences that justify the substantial extra cost 
of a T1 or T3 line. In particular, a T1 or T3 line is a dedicated line — not 
shared by any other users. T1 and T3 are higher-quality connections, so 
you actually get the 1.544 or 44.184 connection speeds. In contrast, both 
cable and DSL connections usually run at substantially less than their 
advertised maximum speeds because of poor-quality connections and 
because the connections are often shared with other users.
	
✓	Business-class cable: Cable TV providers (such as Comcast) offer 
business-class service on their cable network. The price and speed 
depends on your area. For example, where I live, I can get 100Mbps 
service for about $400/month. 
	
	One drawback of business-class cable service is that upload speeds 
are usually much slower than download speeds. For example, a typical 
plan that allows 100Mbps for downloads can support only 10Mbps for 
uploads. Thus, if you need to upload large amounts of data, you’ll notice 
the performance drop.
	
	Another drawback of business-class cable service is that it is, well, cable 
service. Your Internet connection is service by the same people who 
service cable TV in your community. Although business-class customers 
get priority service over residential customers, business-class service 
usually does not include response-time guarantees the way T1/T3 or fiber 
service does. So if your connection goes down, you might find yourself 
down for hours or even a few days instead of minutes or, at worse, a few 
hours.

142
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
✓	Fiber optic: The fastest, most reliable, and most expensive form of 
Internet connection is fiber optic. Fiber optic cable uses strands of glass 
to transmit data over light signals at very high speeds. Because the light 
signals traveling within the fiber cables are not subject to electromagnetic 
interference, fiber connections are extremely reliable; about the only 
thing that can interrupt a fiber connection is if someone physically cuts 
the wire.
	
	Fiber is also very expensive. A 20 Mbps fiber connection can cost well 
over $1,000 per month. However, the connection is extremely reliable, 
and response time to service interruptions is measured in minutes 
instead of hours. 
Sharing an Internet connection
After you choose a method to connect to the Internet, you can turn your 
attention to setting up the connection so that more than one user on your 
network can share it. The best way to do that is by using a separate device 
called a router. You can pick up an inexpensive router for a small network for 
less than $100. Routers suitable for larger networks will, naturally, cost a bit 
more.
Because all communications between your network and the Internet must 
go through the router, the router is a natural place to provide the security 
measures necessary to keep your network safe from the many perils of the 
Internet. As a result, a router used for Internet connections often doubles as 
a firewall, as described in the section “Using a firewall,” later in this chapter.
Securing Your Connection with a Firewall
If your network is connected to the Internet, a whole host of security issues 
bubbles to the surface. You probably connected your network to the Internet 
so that your network’s users could get out to the Internet. Unfortunately, 
however, your Internet connection is a two-way street. It not only enables 
your network’s users to step outside the bounds of your network to access 
the Internet, but it also enables others to step in and access your network.
And step in they will. The world is filled with hackers who are looking for 
networks like yours to break into. They may do it just for the fun of it, or they 
may do it to steal your customers’ credit card numbers or to coerce your 
mail server into sending thousands of spam messages on behalf of the bad 
guys. Whatever their motive, rest assured that your network will be broken 
into if you leave it unprotected.

143
 Chapter 8: Connecting Your Network to the Internet
Using a firewall
A firewall is a security-conscious router that sits between the Internet and 
your network with a single-minded task: preventing them from getting to us. 
The firewall acts as a security guard between the Internet and your local area 
network (LAN). All network traffic into and out of the LAN must pass through 
the firewall, which prevents unauthorized access to the network.
	
Some type of firewall is a must-have if your network has a connection to the 
Internet, whether that connection is broadband (cable modem or DSL), T1, or 
some other high-speed connection. Without it, sooner or later a hacker will 
discover your unprotected network and tell his friends about it, and within a 
few hours, your network will be toast.
You can set up a firewall in two basic ways:
	
✓	Firewall appliance: The easiest way, and usually the best choice. A fire­
wall appliance is basically a self-contained router with built-in firewall 
features.
	
	Most firewall appliances include web-based interfaces that enable you to 
connect to the firewall from any computer on your network by using a 
browser. You can then customize the firewall settings to suit your needs.
	
✓	Server computer: Can be set up to function as a firewall computer.
	
	The server can run just about any network operating system, but most 
dedicated firewall systems run Linux.
Whether you use a firewall appliance or a firewall computer, the firewall must 
be located between your network and the Internet, as shown in Figure 8-1. 
Here, one end of the firewall is connected to a network hub, which is, in turn, 
connected to the other computers on the network. The other end of the fire­
wall is connected to the Internet. As a result, all traffic from the LAN to the 
Internet (and vice versa) must travel through the firewall.
The term perimeter is sometimes used to describe the location of a firewall 
on your network. In short, a firewall is like a perimeter fence that completely 
surrounds your property and forces all visitors to enter through the front gate.
	
In large networks, figuring out exactly where the perimeter is located can be 
a little difficult. If your network has two or more Internet connections, make 
sure that every one of those connections connects to a firewall — and not 
directly to the network. You can do this by providing a separate firewall for 
each Internet connection or by using a firewall with more than one Internet port.

Some firewall routers can also enforce virus protection for your network. For 
more information about virus protection, see Chapter 22.
The built-in Windows firewall
Windows includes a built-in firewall that provides basic packet-filtering fire­
wall protection. In most cases, you’re better off using a dedicated firewall 
router because these devices provide better security features than the built-
in Windows firewall does. Still, the built-in firewall is suitable for home net­
works or very small office networks.
Here are the steps that activate the built-in firewall in Windows XP or Vista:
	
1.	Choose Start➪Control Panel.
	
2.	In the Control Panel, click the Windows Firewall icon.
	
	This step opens the Windows Firewall dialog box. Figure 8-2 shows the 
Windows Vista version.
	
3.	Select the On (Recommended) option.
	
	This option enables the firewall.
	
4.	Click OK.
	
	 That’s all there is to it.

For Windows 7 or 8, the procedure is a bit different:
	
1.	Open the Control Panel.
 
• Windows 7: Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
• Windows 8: Choose Settings➪Control Panel from the Charms bar.
	
2.	Click the System and Security link.
	
	The System and Security page appears.
	
3.	Click the Windows Firewall link.
	
	The Windows Firewall page appears.
	
4.	Click the Turn Windows Firewall On or Off link.
	
	The page shown in Figure 8-3 appears.
	
5.	Select the Turn on Windows Firewall option.
	
	 Note that you can independently turn the firewall on or off for public 
network — that is, for your connection to the Internet — and for your 
home or work network — that is, if you have a network that connects 
other computers in your home or office. I recommend you either turn 
the firewall on for both or turn it off for both. Turn the firewall off if 
you’re using a separate firewall built into the router that connects your 
computer or home or work network to the Internet. Turn the firewall on 
if you don’t have a separate firewall.

146

	 I also recommend leaving the Notify Me When Windows Firewall Blocks 
a New Program option enabled. That way, you’ll be notified when the 
firewall blocks a suspicious program. 
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 The firewall is enabled.
Note that the firewalls included with Windows Vista and Windows 7 have 
additional options you can configure. However, I recommend against fiddling 
with those options unless you’ve taken an upper-division college course in 
computer security.
	
Do not enable the Windows Internet firewall if you’re using a separate firewall 
router to protect your network. Because the other computers on the network 
are connected directly to the router and not to your computer, the firewall 
doesn’t protect the rest of the network. Additionally, as an unwanted side effect, 
the rest of the network will lose the capability of accessing your computer.

ince the beginning of Ethernet networking, cable has been getting smaller 
and easier to work with. The original Ethernet cable was about as thick 
as your thumb, weighed a ton, and was difficult to bend around tight corners. 
Then came coaxial cable, which was lighter and easier to work with. Coaxial 
cable was supplanted by unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable, which is the cable 
used for most networks today.
Although cable through the years has become smaller, cheaper, and easier 
to work with, it is still cable. So you have to drill holes in walls, pull cable 
through ceilings, and get insulation in your hair to wire your entire home or 
office.
The alternative to networking with cables is, of course, networking without 
cables . . . also known as wireless networking. Wireless networks use radio 
waves to send and receive network signals. As a result, a computer can con­
nect to a wireless network at any location in your home or office.
Wireless networks are especially useful for notebook computers. After all, 
the main benefit of a notebook computer is that you can carry it around with 
you wherever you go. At work, you can use your notebook computer at your 
desk, in the conference room, in the break room, or even out in the parking 
lot. At home, you can use it in the bedroom, kitchen, den, or game room, or 
out by the pool. With wireless networking, your notebook computer can be 
connected to the network no matter where you take it. 
Wireless networks have also become extremely useful for other types of 
mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers. Sure, these 
devices can connect via a cell network, but that can get real pricey real quick. 

148
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
With a wireless network, though, you can connect your smart phone or tablet 
without having to pay your cellphone company for the connection time.
This chapter introduces you to the ins and outs of setting up a wireless net­
work. I tell you what you need to know about wireless networking standards, 
how to plan your wireless network, and how to install and configure wireless 
network components. And if you end up with a hybrid network of wired and 
wireless, I show you how to create that, too.
Diving into Wireless Networking
As I mention earlier, a wireless network is just a network that uses radio sig­
nals rather than direct cable connections to exchange information. Simple as 
that. A computer with a wireless network connection is like a cellphone. Just 
as you don’t have to be connected (tethered) to a phone line to use a cell­
phone, you don’t have to be connected to a network cable to use a wireless 
networked computer.
Here are the key concepts and terms you need to understand to set up and 
use a basic wireless network:
	
✓	WLAN: A wireless network is often referred to as a wireless local area 
network (WLAN). Some people prefer to switch the acronym around to 
local area wireless network, or LAWN.
	
✓	Wi-Fi: The term Wi-Fi is often used to describe wireless networks although 
it technically refers to just one form of wireless network: the 802.11b 
standard. (See the section “Eight-Oh-Two-Dot-Eleventy Something?: 
Understanding Wireless Standards,” later in this chapter for more 
information.)
	
✓	SSID: A wireless network has a name, known as a SSID. SSID stands for 
service set identifier. (Wouldn’t that make a great Jeopardy! question? I’ll 
take obscure four-letter acronyms for $400, please!) All the computers 
that belong to a single wireless network must have the same SSID.
	
✓	Channels: Wireless networks can transmit over any of several channels. 
For computers to talk to one another, though, they must be configured 
to transmit on the same channel.
	
✓	Ad-hoc: The simplest type of wireless network consists of two or more 
computers with wireless network adapters. This type of network is an 
ad-hoc mode network.
	
✓	Infrastructure mode: A more complex type of network is an infrastruc­
ture mode network. All this really means is that a group of wireless com­
puters can be connected not only to one another, but also to an existing 
cabled network via a device called a wireless access point (WAP). (I tell 
you more about ad-hoc and infrastructure networks later in this chapter.)

149
 Chapter 9: Setting Up a Wireless Network
A Little High School Electronics
I was a real nerd in high school: I took three years of electronics. The elec­
tronics class at my school was right next door to the auto shop. All the cool 
kids took auto shop, of course, and only nerds like me took electronics. We 
hung in there, though, and learned all about capacitors and diodes while the 
cool kids were learning how to raise their cars and install 2-gigawatt stereo 
systems.
It turns out that a little of that high school electronics information proves 
useful when it comes to wireless networking — not much, but a little. You’ll 
understand wireless networking much better if you know the meanings of 
some basic radio terms.
Waves and frequencies
For starters, radio consists of electromagnetic waves sent through the atmo­
sphere. You can’t see or hear them, but radio receivers can pick them up and 
convert them to sounds, images, or — in the case of wireless networks — 
data. Radio waves are actually cyclical waves of electronic energy that repeat 
at a particular rate: the frequency.
Figure 9-1 shows two frequencies of radio waves. The first is one cycle per 
second; the second is two cycles per second. (Real radio doesn’t operate at 
that low a frequency, but I figured that one and two cycles per second would 
be easier to draw than 680,000 and 2.4 million cycles per second.)
	
The measure of a frequency is cycles per second, which indicates how many 
complete cycles the wave makes in 1 second (duh). In honor of Heinrich Hertz — 
who didn’t invent catsup, but was the first person to successfully send and 
receive radio waves (it happened in the 1880s) — cycles per second is usually 
referred to as Hertz, abbreviated Hz. Thus, 1 Hz is one cycle per second.
	
Incidentally, when the prefix K (for kilo, or 1,000), M (for mega, 1 million), or G 
(for giga, 1 billion) is added to the front of Hz, the H is still capitalized. Thus, 
2.4 MHz is correct (not 2.4 Mhz).
So the beauty of radio frequencies is that transmitters can be tuned to broad­
cast radio waves at a precise frequency. Likewise, receivers can be tuned to 
receive radio waves at a precise frequency, ignoring waves at other frequencies. 
That’s why you can tune the radio in your car to listen to dozens of radio 
stations: Each station broadcasts at its own frequency.

150
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
	
Figure 9-1: 
Radio

Wavelength and antennas
A term related to frequency is wavelength. Radio waves travel at the speed 
of light, and wavelength refers to how far the radio signal travels with each 
cycle. Because the speed of light is roughly 182,282 miles per second, for 
example, the wavelength of a 1 Hz radio wave is about 182,282 miles. The 
wavelength of a 2 Hz signal is about half that: a mere 91,141 miles.

151
 Chapter 9: Setting Up a Wireless Network
As you can see, the wavelength decreases as the frequency increases. The 
wavelength of a typical AM radio station broadcasting at 580 KHz is about 
522 yards. For a TV station broadcasting at 100 MHz, it’s about 3 yards. For a 
wireless network broadcasting at 2.4 GHz, the wavelength is just shorter than 
5 inches.
And the shorter the wavelength, the smaller the antenna needs to be to ade­
quately receive the signal. As a result, higher-frequency transmissions need 
smaller antennas. You may have noticed that AM radio stations usually have 
huge antennas mounted on top of tall towers, but cellphone transmitters are 
much smaller, and their towers aren’t nearly as tall because cellphones oper­
ate on a higher frequency than AM radio stations do. So who decides what 
type of radio gets to use specific frequencies? That’s where spectrums and 
the FCC come in.
Spectrums and the FCC
Spectrum refers to a continuous range of frequencies on which radio can 
operate. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
regulates not only how much of Janet Jackson can be shown at the Super 
Bowl, but also how various portions of the radio spectrum can be used. 
Essentially, the FCC has divided the radio spectrum into dozens of small 
ranges — bands — and restricted certain uses to certain bands. AM radio, for 
example, operates in the band from 535 KHz to 1,700 KHz.
And now, a word from the irony department
I was an English-literature major in college, so I 
like to use literary devices such as irony. I don’t 
get to use it much in the computer books I write, 
so when I get the chance to use irony, I like to 
jump on it like a hog out of water.
So here’s my juicy bit of irony for today: The very 
first Ethernet system was actually a wireless 
network. Ethernet traces its roots to a network 
called AlohaNet, developed at the University of 
Hawaii in 1970. This network transmitted its data 
by using small radios. If two computers tried to 
broadcast data at the same time, the comput­
ers detected the collision and tried again after 
a short, random delay. This technique was the 
inspiration for the basic technique of Ethernet, 
now called “carrier sense multiple access with 
collision detection” or CSMA/CD. The wireless 
AlohaNet was the network that inspired Robert 
Metcalfe to develop his cabled network, which 
he called Ethernet, as his doctoral thesis at 
Harvard in 1973.
For the next 20 years or so, Ethernet was pretty 
much a cable-only network. It wasn’t until the 
mid-1990s that Ethernet finally returned to its 
wireless roots.

152
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
Table 9-1 lists some of the most popular bands. Note that some of these 
bands are wide — UHF television begins at 470 MHz and ends at 806 MHz — 
but other bands are restricted to a specific frequency. The difference 
between the lowest and highest frequency within a band is the bandwidth.

Two of the bands in the spectrum are allocated for use by wireless networks:

networks. In particular, the 2.4 GHz band shares its space with cordless phones. 
As a result, cordless phones sometimes interfere with wireless networks.
Eight-Oh-Two-Dot-Eleventy Something?: 
Understanding Wireless Standards
The most popular standards for wireless networks are the IEEE 802.11 standards. 
These standards are essential wireless Ethernet standards and use many of 
the same networking techniques that the cabled Ethernet standards (in other 
words, 802.3) use. Most notably, 802.11 networks use the same CSMA/CD 
technique as cabled Ethernet to recover from network collisions.

153
 Chapter 9: Setting Up a Wireless Network
The 802.11 standards address the bottom two layers of the IEEE seven-layer 
model: the Physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. Note 
that TCP/IP protocols apply to higher layers of the model. As a result, TCP/IP 
runs just fine on 802.11 networks.
The original 802.11 standard was adopted in 1997. Two additions to the 
standard, 802.11a and 802.11b, were adopted in 1999. The latest and greatest 
versions are 802.11g and 802.11n.
Table 9-2 summarizes the basic characteristics of the four variants of 802.11.

Home on the Range
The maximum range of an 802.11g wireless device indoors is about 300 feet. 
This can have an interesting effect when you get a bunch of wireless comput­
ers together such that some of them are in range of one another but others 
are not. Suppose that Wally, Ward, and the Beaver all have wireless notebooks. 
Wally’s computer is 200 feet away from Ward’s computer, and Ward’s computer 
is 200 feet away from Beaver’s in the opposite direction (see Figure 9-2). In 
this case, Ward can access both Wally’s and Beaver’s computers, but Wally 
can access only Ward’s computer, and Beaver can access only Ward’s com­
puter. In other words, Wally and Beaver won’t be able to access each other’s 
computers because they’re outside the 300-feet range limit. (This is starting 
to sound suspiciously like an algebra problem. Now suppose that Wally starts 
walking toward Ward at 2 miles per hour, and Beaver starts running toward 
Ward at 4 miles per hour. . . .)
Note: Although the normal range for 802.11g is 300 feet, the range may be less 
in actual practice. Obstacles — solid walls, bad weather, cordless phones, 
microwave ovens, backyard nuclear reactors, and so on — can all conspire 
to reduce the effective range of a wireless adapter. If you’re having trouble 
connecting to the network, sometimes just adjusting the antenna helps.

Also, wireless networks tend to slow down when the distance increases. 
802.11g network devices claim to operate at 54 Mbps, but they usually 
achieve that speed only at ranges of 100 feet or less. At 300 feet, they often 
slow to a crawl. You should also realize that when you’re at the edge of the 
wireless device’s range, you’re more likely to lose your connection suddenly 
due to bad weather.
Using Wireless Network Adapters
Each computer that will connect to your wireless network needs a wireless 
network adapter, which is similar to the network interface card (NIC) used 
for a standard Ethernet connection. Instead of having a cable connector on 
the back, however, a wireless network adapter has an antenna.
Just about all notebook computers come with wireless networking built in, 
so you don’t have to add a separate wireless network adapter to a notebook 
computer. Desktop computers, though, are a different story. They typically 
don’t have built-in wireless networking, so you’ll probably need to purchase 
one of two types of wireless adapters:
	
✓	A wireless PCI card: You install this wireless network adapter in an 
available slot inside your desktop computer. Yup, you need to take your 
computer apart, so use this type of card only if you have the expertise 
and the nerves to dig into your computer’s guts.

155
 Chapter 9: Setting Up a Wireless Network
	
✓	A wireless USB adapter: This gizmo is a separate box that plugs into a 
USB port on your computer. Because you can install this type of adapter 
without taking your computer apart, USB adapters are more readily 
available than PCI card adapters. Yea!
Setting Wireless Access Points
Unlike cabled networks, wireless networks don’t need a hub or switch. If all 
you want to do is network a group of wireless computers, you just purchase 
a wireless adapter for each computer, put them all within 300 feet of one 
another, and voilà! — instant network.
But what if you already have an existing cabled network? Suppose that you 
work at an office with 15 computers all cabled up nicely, and you just want 
to add a couple of wireless notebook computers to the network. Or suppose 
that you have two computers in your den connected with network cable, 
but you want to link up a computer in your bedroom without pulling cable 
through the attic.
That’s where a wireless access point (WAP) comes in. A WAP actually per­
forms two functions:
	
✓	It acts as a central connection point for all your computers that have 
wireless network adapters. In effect, the WAP performs essentially the 
same function that a hub or switch performs for a wired network.
	
✓	It links your wireless network to your existing wired network so that 
your wired computer and your wireless computers get along like one big 
happy family. This sounds like the makings of a Dr. Seuss story. (“Now 
the wireless sneeches had hubs without wires. But the twisted-pair 
sneeches had cables to thires. . . .”)
	
Wireless access points are sometimes just called access points (APs), which 
is basically a box with an antenna (or often a pair of antennae) and an RJ-45 
Ethernet port. You plug the AP into a network cable and then plug the other 
end of the cable into a hub or switch, and your wireless network should be 
able to connect to your cabled network.
Figure 9-3 shows how an access point acts as a central connection point for 
wireless computers and also how it bridges your wireless network to your 
wired network.

Infrastructure mode
When you set up a wireless network with an AP, you’re creating an infrastructure 
mode network: The AP provides a permanent infrastructure for the network. 
The APs are installed at fixed physical locations, so the network has relatively 
stable boundaries. Whenever a mobile computer wanders into the range of 
one of the APs, it has come into the sphere of the network and can connect.
An AP and all the wireless computers that are connected to it are a Basic 
Service Set (BSS). Each BSS is identified by a SSID. When you configure an AP, 
you specify the SSID that you want to use. The SSID is often a generic name — 
such as wireless — or it can be a name that you create. Some access points 
use the MAC address of the WAP as the SSID.
Multifunction WAPs
	
Wireless access points often include other built-in features. Some APs double 
as Ethernet hubs or switches; in that case, the AP will have more than one 
RJ-45 port. In addition, some APs include broadband cable or DSL firewall 
routers that enable you to connect to the Internet. For example, I use a 
Linksys wireless router in my home. It includes the following features:

157
 Chapter 9: Setting Up a Wireless Network
	
✓	A wireless access point that lets me connect a notebook computer and a 
computer located on the other side of the house
	
	I didn’t want to run cable through the attic.
	
✓	A four-port gigabit switch that I can use to connect up to four computers 
via twisted-pair cable
	
✓	A DSL/cable router that I connect to my cable modem
	
	This router enables all the computers on the network (cabled and wire­
less) to access the Internet.
	
A multifunction AP designed to serve as an Internet gateway for home networks 
is sometimes called a residential gateway.
Roaming Capabilities
You can use two or more WAPs to create a large wireless network in which 
computer users can roam from area to area and still be connected to the 
wireless network. As the user moves out of the range of one AP, another 
AP automatically picks up the user and takes over without interrupting the 
user’s network service.
To set up two or more APs for roaming, you must carefully place the WAPs so 
that all areas of the office or building that are being networked are in range of 
at least one of the WAPs. Then just make sure that all the computers and APs 
use the same SSID.
Two or more APs joined for roaming, along with all the wireless computers 
connected to any of the access points, form an Extended Service Set (ESS). 
The access points in the ESS are usually connected to a wired network.
One of the current limitations of roaming is that each AP in an ESS must be 
on the same TCP/IP subnet. That way, a computer that roams from one AP to 
another within the ESS retains the same IP address. If the APs had a different 
subnet, a roaming computer would have to change IP addresses when it moved 
from one AP to another.
Wireless bridging
Another use for wireless APs is to bridge separate subnets that can’t easily 
be connected by cable. Suppose that you have two office buildings that are 
only about 50 feet apart. To run cable from one building to the other, you’d 
have to bury conduit — a potentially expensive job. Because the buildings 
are so close, though, you can probably connect them with a pair of WAPs 
that function as a wireless bridge between the two networks. Connect one of 

158
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
the APs to the first network and the other AP to the second network. Then 
configure both APs to use the same SSID and channel.
Ad-hoc networks
A WAP isn’t necessary to set up a wireless network. Any time two or more 
wireless devices come within range of each other, they can link up to form an 
ad-hoc network. If you and a few of your friends all have notebook computers 
with wireless adapters, for example, you can meet anywhere and form an 
ad-hoc network.
All the computers within range of one another in an ad-hoc network are an 
Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS).
Configuring a Wireless Access Point
The physical setup for a WAP is pretty simple: You take it out of the box, put 
it on a shelf or on top of a bookcase near a network jack and a power outlet, 
plug in the power cable, and plug in the network cable.
The software configuration for an AP is a little more involved but still not very 
complicated. It’s usually done via a web interface. To get to the configuration 
page for the AP, you need to know its IP address. Then you just type that 
address in the address bar of a browser on any computer on the network.
Multifunction APs usually provide DHCP and NAT services for the networks 
and double as the network’s gateway router. As a result, they typically have 
a private IP address that’s at the beginning of one of the Internet’s private IP 
address ranges, such as 192.168.0.1 or. Consult the documentation that 
came with the AP to find out more.
	
If you use a multifunction AP that serves as both your wireless AP and your 
Internet router, and you can’t remember the IP address, run the IPCONFIG 
command at a command prompt on any computer on the network. The 
Default Gateway IP address should be the IP address of the access point.
Basic configuration options
Figure 9-4 shows the main configuration screen for a typical router. I called 
up this configuration page by entering 192.168.1.1 in the address bar of a 
web browser and then supplying the login password when prompted.

159

configura-
tion page 
for a Linksys

router.
	
On the main setup page of this router, you configure information such as the 
hostname and IP address of the router and whether the router’s DHCP server 
should be enabled. Options found on additional tabs allow you to configure 
wireless settings, such as the network name (SSID), the type of security to 
enforce, and a variety of other settings.
DHCP configuration
You can configure most multifunction APs to operate as a DHCP server. For 
small networks, the AP is commonly the DHCP server for the entire network. 
In that case, you need to configure the AP’s DHCP server. Figure 9-5 shows 
the DHCP configuration page for a Linksys WAP router. To enable DHCP, you 
select the Enable option and then specify the other configuration options to 
use for the DHCP server.
Larger networks with more demanding DHCP requirements are likely to have 
a separate DHCP server running on another computer. In that case, you can 
defer to the existing server by disabling the DHCP server in the AP.
For more information on configuring a DHCP server, please refer to Chapter 5.

Configuring Windows XP for 
Wireless Networking
If you need to configure an older Windows XP computer for wireless network­
ing, you must first install the appropriate device driver for your wireless 
network adapter. To do that, you need the installation CD that came with 
the adapter. Follow the instructions that came with the adapter to install the 
drivers.
Windows XP has some nice built-in features for working with wireless net­
works. Follow these steps to access the features:
	
1.	Open the Network Connections folder.
	
	 Choose Start➪Control Panel and then double-click the Network 
Connections icon.
	
2.	 Right-click the wireless network connection and choose Properties to 
open the Properties dialog box.
	
3.	Click the Wireless Networks tab (see Figure 9-7).
	
Figure 9-7: 
Configuring

Each time you connect to a wireless network, Windows XP adds that network 
to this dialog box. Then you can juggle the order of the networks in the 
Preferred Networks section to indicate which network you prefer to join if 
you find yourself within range of two or more networks at the same time. You 

162
Part II: Setting Up a Network 
can use the Move Up and Move Down buttons next to the Preferred Networks 
list to change your preferences.
To add a network that you haven’t yet joined, click the Add button. This action 
opens the dialog box shown in Figure 9-8. Here, you can type the SSID value for 
the network that you want to add. You can also specify other information, such 
as whether to use data encryption, how to authenticate yourself, and whether 
the network is an ad hoc rather than an infrastructure network.
	
Figure 9-8:

When your computer comes within range of a wireless network, a pop-up 
balloon appears on the taskbar, indicating that a network is available. If one 
of your preferred networks is within range, clicking the balloon automatically 
connects you to that network. If Windows XP doesn’t recognize any of the net­
works, clicking the balloon displays the Wireless Network Connection dialog 
box. From there, you can choose the network that you want to join (if more 
than one network is listed) and then click Connect to join the selected network.

O

ne of the basic choices that you must make before you proceed any 
further in building your network is to decide which network operating 
system (NOS) to use as the foundation for your network. This chapter begins 
with a description of several important features found in all network operating 
systems. Next, it provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages 
of the most popular NOSes.
Of course, your work doesn’t end with the selection of an NOS. You must then 
install and configure the operating system to get it working. This chapter 
provides an overview of what’s involved with installing and configuring 
Microsoft’s latest and greatest server operating system, Windows Server 2012.
Network Operating System Features
All NOSes must provide certain core functions, such as connecting to other 
computers on the network, sharing files and other resources, and providing 
for security. In the following sections, I describe some core NOS features in 
general terms.

166
Part III: Working with Servers 
Network support
It goes without saying that an NOS should support networks. That requires a 
range of technical capabilities:
	
✓	An NOS must support a wide variety of networking protocols to meet the 
needs of its users.
	
	A large network typically consists of a mixture of various versions 
of Windows as well as Macintosh and Linux computers. As a result, 
the server may need to simultaneously support TCP/IP, NetBIOS, and 
AppleTalk protocols.
	
✓	Many servers have more than one network interface card (NIC) installed. 
In that case, the NOS must be able to support multiple network connections:
 
• Ideally, the NOS should be able to balance the network load among 
its network interfaces.
 
• If one of the connections fails, the NOS should be able to seamlessly 
switch to another connection.
	
✓	Most NOSes include a built-in capability to function as a router that 
connects two networks.
	
	The NOS router functions should also include firewall features to keep 
unauthorized packets from entering the local network.
File-sharing services
One of the most important functions of an NOS is to share resources with other 
network users. The most common resource that’s shared is the server’s file 
system — organized disk space that a network server must be able to share 
(in whole or in part) with other users. In effect, those users can treat the 
server’s disk space as an extension of their own computers’ disk space.
The NOS allows the system administrator to determine which portions of the 
server’s file system to share.
	
Although an entire hard drive can be shared, it isn’t commonly done. Instead, 
individual folders are shared. The administrator can control which users are 
allowed to access each shared folder.
Because file sharing is the reason why many network servers exist, NOSes 
have more sophisticated disk management features than are found in desktop 
OSes. For example, most NOSes can manage two or more hard drives as 
though they were a single drive. In addition, most can create a mirror — an 
automatic backup copy of a drive — on a second drive.

167
 Chapter 10: Setting Up a Server
Multitasking
Only one user at a time uses a desktop computer; however, multiple users 
simultaneously use server computers. As a result, an NOS must provide sup­
port for multiple users who access the server remotely via the network.
At the heart of multiuser support is multitasking — a technique that slices pro­
cessing time microthin and juggles the pieces lightning fast among running 
programs. It’s how an OS can execute more than one program (a task or a 
process) at a time. Multitasking operating systems are like the guy who used 
to spin plates balanced on sticks on the old Ed Sullivan Show: running from 
plate to plate, trying to keep them all spinning so that they don’t fall off the 
sticks. To make it challenging, he’d do it blindfolded or riding on a unicycle. 
Substitute programs for the plates and file management for the unicycle, and 
there you are.
Although multitasking creates the appearance that two or more programs 
execute on the computer at the same time, in reality, a computer with a 
single processor can execute only one program at a time. The OS switches 
the CPU from one program to another to create the appearance that several 
programs execute simultaneously, but at any given moment, only one program 
processes commands. The others are patiently waiting their turns. (However, 
if the computer has more than one CPU core, the CPU cores can execute 
programs simultaneously — but that’s another kettle of fish.)
Directory services
Directories are everywhere — and were, even in the days when they were all 
hard copy. When you needed to make a phone call, you looked up the number 
in a phone directory. When you needed to find the address of a client, you 
looked her up in your Rolodex. And then there were the nonbook versions: 
When you needed to find the Sam Goody store at a shopping mall (for exam­
ple), you looked for the mall directory — usually, a lighted sign showing what 
was where.
Networks have directories, too, providing information about the resources 
that are available on the network: users, computers, printers, shared folders, 
and files. Directories are essential parts of any NOS.
In early NOSes (such as Windows NT 3.1 and NetWare 3.x), each server 
computer maintained its own directory database — a file that contained an 
organized list of the resources available just on that server. The problem 
with that approach was that network administrators had to maintain each 
directory database separately. That wasn’t too bad for networks with just a 
few servers, but maintaining the directory on a network with dozens or even 
hundreds of servers was next to impossible.

168
Part III: Working with Servers 
In addition, early directory services (programs that made the directory databases 
usable) were application-specific. For example, a server had one directory 
database for user logons, another for file sharing, and yet another for e-mail 
addresses. Each directory had its own tools for adding, updating, and deleting 
directory entries.
The most popular modern directory service is Active Directory (AD), 
which is standard with Windows-based server OSes. Active Directory 
provides a single directory of all network resources. It drops the old-style 
15-character domain and computer names used by Windows NT Server in 
favor of Internet-style DNS-style names, such as Marketing.MyCompany.
com or Sales.YourCompany.com. Figure 10-1 shows the Active Directory 
Users and Computers tool, which manages Active Directory user and com­
puter accounts on Windows Server 2008.
	
Figure 10-1: 
Active 
Directory 
Users and 
Computers.
	
Security services
All NOSes must provide some measure of security to protect the network 
from unauthorized access. Hacking seems to be the national pastime these 
days. With most computer networks connected to the Internet, anyone any­
where in the world can — and probably will — try to break into your network.
The most basic type of security is handled through user accounts, which grant 
individual users the right to access the network resources and govern which 
resources the user can access. User accounts are secured by passwords; 
therefore, good password policy is a cornerstone of any security system. Most 
NOSes give you some standard tools for maintaining network security:

169
 Chapter 10: Setting Up a Server
	
✓	Establish password policies. For example, you can mandate that pass­
words have a minimum length and include a mix of letters and numerals.
	
✓	Set passwords to expire after a certain number of days. Network users 
must change their passwords frequently.
	
✓	Encrypt network data. A data-encryption capability scrambles data 
before it’s sent over the network or saved on disk, making unauthorized 
use a lot more difficult.
	
	Good encryption is the key to setting up a virtual private network (VPN), 
which enables network users to securely access a network from a 
remote location by using an Internet connection.
	
✓	Issue digital certificates. These special codes are used to ensure that 
users are who they say they are and files are what they claim to be.
Microsoft’s Server Operating Systems
Over the years, Microsoft has released several versions of its Windows-based 
server OS: Windows NT Server 4, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2003 Server, 
and Windows Server 2008 — and now Windows Server 2012. Most organizations 
are still using Windows Server 2008 or 2003. In fact, plenty of organizations 
still use Windows 2000 Server, and a few (mostly on deserted islands cut off 
from civilization) run Windows NT Server 4.
NTFS drives
All server versions of Windows use a special 
type of formatting for hard drives, different 
from the standard FAT system used by MS-DOS 
since the early 1980s. (FAT stands for File 
Allocation Table, in case you’re interested.) The 
file system, called NTFS (for NT File System), 
offers many advantages over FAT drives:
	✓	NTFS is much more efficient at using the 
space on your hard drive. As a result, NTFS 
can cram more data onto a given hard drive 
than FAT.
	✓	NTFS drives provide better security features 
than FAT drives. NTFS stores security infor­
mation on disk for each file and directory. 
In contrast, FAT has only rudimentary secu­
rity features.
	✓	NTFS drives are more reliable because 
NTFS keeps duplicate copies of important 
information, such as the location of each 
file on the hard drive. If a problem develops 
on an NTFS drive, Windows NT Server can 
probably correct the problem without losing 
any data. In contrast, FAT drives are prone 
to losing information.
Note that Windows Server 2012 introduces a 
new file system called ReFS that will eventually 
replace NTFS. However, it will probably be sev­
eral years before ReFS gains wide acceptance.

170
Part III: Working with Servers 
Each new version builds on the previous version by introducing new and 
improved features. However, keep in mind as you read the following sections 
that Windows NT Server 4, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows 2003 Server 
are considered obsolete.
Windows NT Server 4
Windows NT Server was the last in a long series of Windows servers dubbed 
NT, which stood for New Technology. The “new technology” that got every­
one so excited about Windows NT in the first place was 32-bit processing, 
which was a huge step from the 16-bit processing of earlier versions of 
Windows. Windows NT was the first Microsoft OS that was reliable enough 
to work as a network server on large networks. At more than 16 years old, 
Windows NT 4 is hopelessly obsolete, but it’s still important because of its 
legacy. Many OS features that were first introduced as part of Windows NT 4 
are still in use today.
Probably the most important feature of Windows NT is its directory model, 
which is based on the concept of domains, which are groups of computers 
managed by a single directory database. To access shared resources within 
a domain, you must have a valid user account within the domain and be 
granted rights to access the resources in which you’re interested. The domain 
system uses 15-character NetBIOS names to access individual computers 
within a domain and to name the domain itself.
Windows 2000 Server
Windows 2000 Server, built on the strengths of Windows NT Server 4, was 
faster, easier to manage, more reliable, and easier to use for large and small 
networks alike.
The most significant new feature offered by Windows 2000 Server was Active 
Directory (AD), which provides a single directory of all network resources 
and enables program developers to incorporate the directory into their pro­
grams. Active Directory drops the 15-character domain and computer names 
in favor of Internet-style DNS names, such as Marketing.MyCompany.
com or Sales.YourCompany.com. (However, it still supports the old-style 
names for older clients that don’t deal well with DNS names.)
Windows 2000 Server came in three versions:
	
✓	Windows 2000 Server was the basic server, designed for small to medium-
sized networks. It included all the basic server features, including file 
and printer sharing, and acted as a web and e-mail server.

171
 Chapter 10: Setting Up a Server
	
✓	Windows 2000 Advanced Server was the next step up, designed for 
larger networks. Advanced Server could support server computers that 
had up to 8GB of memory (not hard drive — RAM!) and four integrated 
processors instead of the single processor that desktop computers and 
most server computers had.
	
✓	Windows 2000 Datacenter Server supported servers that had as many 
as 32 processors with up to 64GB of RAM and was specially designed for 
large database applications.
For small networks with 50 or fewer computers, Microsoft offered a special 
Small Business Server bundle, which included the following components for 
one low, low price:
	
✓	Windows Server 2003: The OS for your network server
	
✓	Exchange Server 2003: For e-mail and instant messaging
	
✓	SQL Server 2000: A database server
	
✓	FrontPage 2000: For building websites
	
✓	Outlook 2000: For reading e-mail
Windows 2003 Server
The next server version of Windows was Windows 2003 Server, which was 
built on Windows 2000 Server, with the following added features:
	
✓	A new-and-improved version of AD with tighter security, an easier-to-use 
interface, and better performance.
	
✓	A better and easier-to-use system management interface: the Manage 
My Server window. On the flip side, for those who prefer brute-force 
commands, Windows 2003 Server includes a more comprehensive set 
of command line management tools than is offered by Windows 2000 
Server. Of course, the familiar Microsoft Management Console tools 
from Windows 2000 Server are still there.
	
✓	A major change in the application-programming interface for Windows 
programs, known as the .NET Framework.
	
✓	Support for ever-larger clusters of computers. A cluster is a set of com­
puters that work together as if they were a single server. Windows 2000 
Server Datacenter Edition and previous versions supported clusters of 
four servers; Windows 2003 Server Enterprise and Datacenter Editions 
support clusters of eight servers. (Obviously, this is a benefit only for 
very large networks. The rest of us should just grin and say, “Cool!”)
	
✓	An enhanced distributed file system that lets you combine drives on 
several servers to create one shared volume.

172
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
✓	Support for storage area networks (SANs).
	
✓	A built-in Internet firewall to secure your Internet connection.
	
✓	A new version of Microsoft’s web server, Internet Information Services 
(IIS) 6.0.
Like its predecessor, Windows 2003 Server shipped in several versions:
	
✓	Windows 2003 Server, Standard Edition: This is the basic version of 
Windows 2003. If you’re using Windows Server 2003 as a file server or 
to provide other basic network services, this is the version you’ll use. 
Standard Edition can support servers with up to four processors and 
4GB of RAM.
	
✓	Windows 2003 Server, Web Edition: A version of Windows 2003 optimized 
for use as a web server.
	
✓	Windows 2003 Server, Enterprise Edition: Designed for larger networks, 
this version can support servers with up to eight processors, 32GB of RAM, 
server clusters, and advanced features designed for high performance 
and reliability.
	
✓	Windows 2003 Server, Datacenter Edition: The most powerful version 
of Windows 2003, with support for servers with 64 processors, 64GB of 
RAM, and server clusters, as well as advanced fault-tolerance features 
designed to keep the server running for mission-critical applications.
Windows Server 2008
In February of 2008, Microsoft released the successor to Windows 2003 
Server, not surprisingly known as Windows Server 2008. Windows Server 
2008 added many new features, including the following:
	
✓	Even more enhancements to AD, including the ability to manage digital 
certificates, a new type of domain controller (a read-only domain con­
troller), and the ability to stop and restart AD services without shutting 
down the entire server.
	
✓	A new graphical user interface (GUI) based on Windows Vista, including 
a new all-in-one management tool: Server Manager.
	
✓	A new version of the OS called Server Core, which has no GUI. Server 
Core is run entirely from the command line or by a remote computer 
that connects to the server via Microsoft Management Console. Server 
Core is designed to provide efficient file servers, domain controllers, or 
DNS and DHCP servers.

173
 Chapter 10: Setting Up a Server
	
✓	Remote connection enhancements that enable computers to establish 
web-based connections to the server using the HTTPS protocol without 
having to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection.
	
✓	Yet another new version of the Internet Information Services (IIS) web 
server (7.0).
Windows Server 2008 R2
In the fall of 2009, Microsoft issued an update to Windows Server 2008, offi­
cially called Windows Server 2008 R2. Network administrators the world over 
rejoiced, in part because most of them are also Star Wars fans and they can 
now refer to their favorite operating system as “R2.”
R2 builds on Windows Server 2008 with a variety of new features, including 
virtualization features that let you run more than one instance of the OS on a 
single server computer, a new version of IIS (7.5), and support for up to 256 
processors.
Also, R2 officially drops support for 32-bit processors. In other words, R2 
runs only on server-class 64-bit processors, such as Intel Itanium and Xeon.
Windows Server 2012
The newest version of Windows Server, officially known as Windows Server 
2012, offers many significant improvements over Windows Server 2008, the 
most notable being the new Metro user interface (UI), which is designed for 
use with touch-sensitive displays.
Other new features of Windows Server 2012 include
	
✓	A new file system – ReFS – that replaces NTFS, providing better perfor­
mance and reliability
	
✓	A redesigned Task Manager designed to highlight which system tasks 
are drawing more of the server’s CPU, memory, and disk and network 
I/O capacity
	
✓	IP Address Management, which is a feature designed to automatically 
discover what IP addresses are being used by computers and other 
devices on the network
	
✓	The ability to support servers with as many as 640 processors and 4TB 
of RAM

Part III: Working with Servers 
Seeing Other Server Operating Systems
Although Windows Server is the most popular choice of NOS, you have other 
choices. The following sections briefly describe two other server choices: 
Linux and Macintosh OS X Server.
Linux
Perhaps the most interesting OS now available is Linux. The free Linux OS is 
based on Unix, which is a powerful NOS often used on large networks. Linux 
was started by Linus Torvalds, who thought it’d be fun to write a version of 
Unix in his free time — as a hobby. He enlisted help from hundreds of pro­
grammers throughout the world, who volunteered their time and efforts via 
the Internet. Today, Linux is a full-featured version of Unix; its users consider 
it to be as good as or better than Windows.
Linux offers the same networking benefits of Unix and can be an excellent 
choice as a server OS.
Mac OS X Server
All the other server OSes I describe in this chapter run on Intel-based PCs 
with Pentium or Pentium-compatible processors. But what about Macintosh 
computers? After all, Macintosh users need networks, too. For Macintosh 
networks, Apple offers a special NOS — Mac OS X Server — which has all 
the features you expect, including file and printer sharing, Internet features, 
e-mail, and more.
Novell NetWare
NetWare was once the king of network operating systems. Today, NetWare 
networks are rare, but you can still find them if you look hard enough. NetWare 
has always had an excellent reputation for reliability. In fact, some network 
administrators swear that they have NetWare servers on their networks 
that have been running continuously, without a single reboot, since Ronald 
Reagan was president. (Unfortunately, there hasn’t been a major upgrade to 
NetWare since George W. Bush’s first term.)
Novell released the first version of NetWare in 1983, two years before the first 
version of Windows and four years before Microsoft’s first network operating 

175
 Chapter 10: Setting Up a Server
system, the now defunct LAN Manager. Over the years, NetWare has gone 
through many versions. The most important versions were
	
✓	NetWare version 3.x, the version that made NetWare famous. NetWare 
3.x used a now-outdated directory scheme called the bindery. Each 
NetWare 3.x server has a bindery file that contains information about 
the resources on that particular server. With the bindery, you had to log 
on separately to each server that contained resources you wanted to use.
	
✓	NetWare 4.x, in which NetWare Directory Service (NDS) replaced the 
bindery. NDS is similar to AD. It provides a single directory for the entire 
network rather than separate directories for each server.
	
✓	NetWare 5.x was the next step, with a new UI based on Java for easier 
administration, improved support for Internet protocols, multiprocessing 
with up to 32 processors, and many other features.
	
✓	NetWare 6.0 introduced a variety of new features, including a new disk 
management system (Novell Storage Services); web-based access to net­
work folders and printers; and built-in support for Windows, Linux, Unix, 
and Macintosh file systems.
	
✓	Novell released its last major version of NetWare (6.5) in summer 2003. 
It included improvements to its browser-based management tools and 
was bundled with open source servers, such as Apache and MySQL.
Beginning in 2005, NetWare has transformed itself into a Linux-based system: 
Open Enterprise System (OES). In OES, the core of the OS is actually Linux, 
with added applications that run the traditional NetWare services such as 
directory services. (For more information, see “Linux,” earlier in this chapter.)
The Many Ways to Install a 
Network Operating System
Regardless of which NOS you choose to use for your network servers, you 
can use any of several common ways to actually install the NOS software on 
the server computer. The following sections describe these alternatives.
Full install versus upgrade
One of the basic NOS installation choices is whether you want to perform a full 
installation or an upgrade installation. In some cases, you may be better off 
performing a full installation even if you’re installing the NOS on a computer 
with an earlier version of the NOS installed:

176
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
✓	If you’re installing the NOS on a new server, you’ll be performing a full 
installation that installs the OS and configures it with default settings.
	
✓	If you’re installing the NOS on a server computer that already has a 
server OS installed, you can perform an upgrade installation to replace the 
existing OS with the new one, yet retain as many of the settings from 
the existing OS as possible.
	
✓	You can also perform a full installation on a computer that already has 
an OS installed. In that case, you have the option of deleting the existing 
OS or performing a multiboot installation that installs the new server OS 
alongside the existing OS. Then, when you restart the computer, you can 
choose which OS you want to run.
	
✓	Although multiboot installation may sound like a good idea, it’s fraught 
with peril. Avoid multiboot unless you have a specific reason to use it.
	
✓	You can’t upgrade a client version of Windows to a server version. 
Instead, you must perform a full installation, which deletes the existing 
Windows OS, or a multiboot installation, which leaves the existing client 
Windows intact. Either way, however, you can preserve existing data on 
the Windows computer when you install the server version.
Installing over the network
Typically, you install the NOS directly from the CD-ROM distribution discs 
on the server’s CD-ROM drive. However, you can also install the OS from 
a shared drive located on another computer — provided that the server 
computer already has access to the network. You can either use a shared 
CD-ROM drive or copy the entire contents of the distribution CD-ROM disc 
onto a shared hard drive.
	
If you’re going to install the NOS onto more than one server, save time by first 
copying the distribution CD onto a shared hard drive. That’s because even 
the fastest CD-ROM drives are slower than the network. Even with a slow 100 
Mbps network, access to hard drive data over the network is much faster than 
access to a local CD-ROM drive.
Gathering Your Stuff
Before you install an NOS, gather everything you need so you don’t have 
to look for something in the middle of the setup. The following sections 
describe the items you’re most likely to need.

177
 Chapter 10: Setting Up a Server
A capable server computer
Obviously, you have to have a server computer on which to install the NOS. 
Each NOS has a list of minimum hardware requirements supported by the OS. 
For example, Table 10-1 summarizes the minimum requirements for Windows 
Server 2012.
My suggestion is that you take these minimums with a grain of salt. Windows 
Server 2012 will crawl like a snail with 512MB of RAM; I wouldn’t bother with 
less than 4GB, and 16GB is a more appropriate minimum for most purposes.
Table 10-1	
Minimum Hardware Requirements for 
	
Windows Server 2012
Item
Windows Server 2012
CPU
1.4 GHz
RAM
512MB
Free disk space
32GB
Also check your server hardware against the list of compatible hardware 
published by the maker of your NOS. For example, Microsoft publishes a list 
of hardware that it has tested and certified as compatible with Windows 
servers. You can find this list at www.windowsservercatalog.com.
The server OS
You also need a server OS to install. You need the distribution CDs or DVDs 
or access to copies of them over the network. In addition to the discs, you 
should have the following:
	
✓	The product key: The installation program will ask you to prove that 
you have a legal copy of the software. If you have the actual CDs or 
DVDs, the product key should be on a sticker attached to the case.
	
✓	Manuals: If the OS came with printed manuals, you should keep them 
handy. If the manuals are in PDF form, keep the PDFs handy.
	
✓	Your license type: You can purchase Microsoft OSes on a per-server 
or a per-user/per-device basis. You need to know which plan you have 
when you install the NOS.

178
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Check the CD or DVD distribution disc for product documentation and addi­
tional last-minute information. For example, Windows servers have a \docs 
folder that contains several files that have useful setup information.
Other software
In most cases, the installation program should be able to automatically con­
figure your server’s hardware devices and install appropriate drivers. Just in 
case, though, you should dig out the driver disks/discs that came with your 
devices, such as network interface cards (NICs), SCSI devices, DVD drives, 
printers, scanners, and so on.
A working Internet connection
Online connectivity isn’t an absolute requirement, but the installation will go 
much smoother if you have a working Internet connection before you start. 
The installation process may use this Internet connection for several things:
	
✓	Downloading late-breaking updates or fixes to the OS: This can elimi­
nate the need to install a Service Pack after you finish installing the NOS.
	
✓	Locating drivers for nonstandard devices: This can be a big plus if you 
can’t find the driver disk for an obscure SCSI card.
	
✓	Activating the product after you complete the installation (for 
Microsoft OSes)
A good book
You’ll spend lots of time watching progress bars during installation, so you 
may as well have something to do while you wait. I recommend Les Miserables.
Making Informed Decisions
When you install a NOS, you have to make some decisions about how you 
want the OS and its servers configured. Most of these decisions aren’t cast in 
stone, so don’t worry if you’re not 100 percent sure how you want everything 
configured. You can always go back and reconfigure things. However, you’ll 
save yourself time if you make the right decisions up front rather than just 
guess when the setup program starts asking you questions.

179
 Chapter 10: Setting Up a Server
The following list details most of the decisions that you’ll need to make. (This 
list is for Windows Server 2012 installations. For other network OSes, the 
decisions may vary slightly.)
	
✓	The existing OS: If you want to retain the existing OS, the installation 
program can perform a multiboot setup, which allows you to choose 
which OS to boot to each time you start the computer. This is rarely a 
good idea for server computers, so I recommend that you elect to delete 
the existing OS.
	
✓	Partition structure: Most of the time, you’ll want to treat the entire 
server disk as a single partition. However, if you want to divide the disk 
into two or more partitions, you should do so during setup. (Unlike most 
of the other setup decisions, this one is hard to change later.)
	
✓	Computer name: During the OS setup, you’ll be asked to provide the 
computer name used to identify the server on the network. If your net­
work has only a few servers, you can just pick a name such as Server01 
or MyServer. If your network has more than a few servers, you’ll want to 
establish a naming convention you can follow for naming your servers. 
	
✓	Administrator password: Okay, this one is tough. You don’t want to pick 
something obvious, like Password, Administrator, or your last name. 
On the other hand, you don’t want to type in something random that 
you’ll later forget because you’ll find yourself in a big pickle if you forget 
the administrator password. I suggest that you make up a complex 
password with uppercase and lowercase letters, some numerals, and a 
special symbol or two; then write it down and keep it in a secure location 
where you know it won’t get lost.
	
✓	Networking protocols: You’ll almost always need to install the TCP/
IP protocol, the Microsoft network client protocol, and file and printer 
sharing. Depending on how the server will be used, you may want to 
install other protocols as well.
	
✓	TCP/IP configuration: You’ll need to know what IP address to use for 
the server. Even if your network has a DHCP server to dynamically 
assign IP addresses to clients, most servers use static IP addresses.
	
✓	Workgroup or domain: You’ll need to decide whether the server will 
join a domain or just be a member of a workgroup. In either case, 
you need to know the domain name or the workgroup name. (In most 
cases, if you are installing Windows Server, you’ll be using a domain. 
Workgroups are mostly used for peer-to-peer networks that do not have 
dedicated servers.) 
Final Preparations
Before you begin the actual installation, take a few more steps:

180
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
✓	Tidy up. Clean up the server’s disk by uninstalling any software that you 
don’t need and removing any old data that is no longer needed. This 
cleanup is especially important if you’re converting a computer that’s 
been in use as a client computer to a server. You probably don’t need 
Microsoft Office or a bunch of games on the computer after it becomes 
a server.
	
✓	Backup. Do a complete backup of the computer. Operating system 
setup programs are almost flawless, so the chances of losing data during 
installation are minimal, but you still face the chance that something 
may go wrong.
	
✓	Disconnect serial and USB connection. If the computer is connected to 
an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that has a serial or USB connection 
to the computer, unplug the serial or USB connection. In some cases, 
this control connection can confuse the OS’s setup program when it 
tries to determine which devices are attached to the computer.
	
✓	Uncompress drives. If the computer has hard drives compressed with 
DriveSpace or DoubleSpace, uncompress the drives before you begin.
	
✓	Chill out. Light some votive candles, take two acetaminophen, and put 
on a pot of coffee.
Installing a Network Operating System
The following sections present an overview of a typical installation of Windows 
Server 2012. Although the details vary, the overall installation process for 
other NOSes is similar.
In most cases, the best way to install Windows Server 2012 is to perform 
a new install directly from the DVD installation media. Although upgrade 
installs are possible, your server will be more stable if you perform a new 
install. (For this reason, most network administrators avoid upgrading to 
Windows Server 2012 until it’s time to replace the server hardware.)
To begin the installation, insert the DVD distribution media in the server’s 
DVD drive and then restart the server. This causes the server to boot directly 
from the distribution media, which initiates the setup program.
As the setup program proceeds, it leads you through two distinct installation 
phases: Collecting Information and Installing Windows. The following sections 
describe these installation phases in greater detail.

181
 Chapter 10: Setting Up a Server
Phase 1: Collecting Information
In the first installation phase, the setup program asks for the preliminary 
information that it needs to begin the installation. A setup wizard prompts 
you for the following information:
	
✓	Language: Select your language, time zone, and keyboard type.
	
✓	Product Key: Enter the 25-character product key that came with the 
installation media. If setup says that you entered an invalid product key, 
double-check it carefully. You probably just made a typo.
	
✓	Operating System Type: Select Windows Server 2012 Standard Edition 
or Core.
 
• Standard Edition: Install the full server OS.
 
• Core: Install the new text-only version. Use this version only if you 
are a master of the Windows Server command-line interface known 
as PowerShell.
	
✓	License Agreement: The official license agreement is displayed. You 
have to agree to its terms to proceed.
	
✓	Install Type: Choose an Upgrade or Clean Install type.
	
✓	Disk Location: Choose the partition in which you want to install Windows.
Phase 2: Installing Windows
In this phase, Windows setup begins the actual process of installing 
Windows. The following steps are performed in sequence:
	
1.	 Copying Files: Compressed versions of the installation files are copied to 
the server computer.
	
2.	 Expanding Files: The compressed installation files are expanded.
	
3.	 Installing Features: Windows server features are installed.
	
4.	 Installing Updates: The setup program checks the Microsoft website and 
downloads any critical updates to the OS.
	
5.	 Completing Installation: When the updates are installed, the setup program 
reboots so it can complete the installation.
Configuring Your Server
After you install Windows Server 2012, the computer automatically reboots, and 
you’re presented with the Server Manager program as shown in Figure 10-2.

182
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Figure 10-2: 
The 
Windows 
2012 Server 
Manager.
	
From Server Manager, you can perform a number of tasks that are necessary 
to configure the server for production use. Specifically, you can configure 
the server roles: the networking features that the server will provide, such 
as file server, web server, DHCP server, and DNS server.

User Accounts

E

very user who accesses a network must have a user account. User accounts 
allow you — as network administrator — to control who can access the 
network and who can’t. In addition, user accounts let you specify what network 
resources each user can use. Without user accounts, all your resources would 
be open to anyone who casually dropped by your network.
Understanding Windows User Accounts
User accounts are among the basic tools for managing a Windows server. As 
a network administrator, you’ll spend a large percentage of your time dealing 
with user accounts — creating new ones, deleting expired ones, resetting 
passwords for forgetful users, granting new access rights, and so on. Before 
I get into the specific procedures of creating and managing user accounts, 
this section presents an overview of user accounts and how they work.
Local accounts versus domain accounts
A local account is a user account stored on a particular computer, applicable 
to that computer only. Typically, each computer on your network has a local 
account for each person who uses that computer.

184
Part III: Working with Servers 
By contrast, a domain account is a user account that’s stored by Active 
Directory (AD) and can be accessed from any computer that’s a part of the 
domain. Domain accounts are centrally managed. This chapter deals primar­
ily with setting up and maintaining domain accounts.
User account properties
Every user account has several important account properties that specify 
the characteristics of the account. The three most important account 
properties are
	
✓	Username: A unique name that identifies the account. The user must 
enter the username when logging on to the network. The username is 
public information. In other words, other network users can (and often 
should) find out your username.
	
✓	Password: A secret word that must be entered to gain access to the 
account. You can set up Windows so that it enforces password policies, 
such as the minimum length of the password, whether the password 
must contain a mixture of letters and numerals, and how long the pass­
word remains current before the user must change it.
	
✓	Group membership: The group(s) to which the user account belongs. 
Group memberships are the key to granting access rights to users so 
that they can access various network resources (such as file shares or 
printers) or perform certain network tasks (such as creating new user 
accounts or backing up the server).
Many other account properties record information about the user, such as 
the user’s contact information, whether the user is allowed to access the 
system only at certain times or from certain computers, and so on.
Creating a New User
To create a new domain user account in Windows Server 2012, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Choose Start➪Administrative Tools➪Active Directory Users and 
Computers.
	
	 This command fires up the Active Directory Users and Computers 
management console, as shown in Figure 11-1.

185
 Chapter 11: Managing Windows User Accounts
	
Figure 11-1: 
The Active 
Directory 
Users and 
Computers 
management 
console.
	
	
2.	Right-click the domain that you want to add the user to and then 
choose New➪User from the contextual menu.
	
	 This command summons the New Object – User Wizard, as shown in 
Figure 11-2.
	
Figure 11-2: 
Use the 
wizard to 
create a 
new user.
	
	
3.	Enter the user’s first name, middle initial, and last name.
	
	 As you fill in these fields, the New Object Wizard automatically fills in 
the Full Name field.

186
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
4.	Change the Full Name field if you want it to appear different from 
what the wizard proposes.
	
	 You may want to reverse the first and last names so the last name 
appears first, for example.
	
5.	Enter the user logon name.
	
	 This name must be unique within the domain. (Don’t worry, if you try to 
use a name that isn’t unique, you’ll get an error message.)
	
	 Pick a naming scheme to follow when creating user logon names. You 
can use the first letter of the first name followed by the complete last 
name, the complete first name followed by the first letter of the last name, 
or any other scheme that suits your fancy.
	
6.	Click Next.
	
	 The second page of the New Object – User Wizard appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-3.
	
Figure 11-3: 
Set the 
user’s 
password.
	
	
7.	Enter the password twice.
	
	 You’re asked to enter the password and then confirm it, so type it cor­
rectly. If you don’t enter it identically in both boxes, you’re asked to cor­
rect your mistake.
	
8.	Specify the password options that you want to apply.
	
	 The following password options are available:
 
• User Must Change Password at Next Logon
 
• User Cannot Change Password
 
• Password Never Expires
 
• Account Is Disabled

187
 Chapter 11: Managing Windows User Accounts
	
	 For more information about these options, see the section “Setting 
account options,” later in this chapter.
	
9.	Click Next.
	
	 You’re taken to the final page of the New Object – User Wizard, as shown 
in Figure 11-4.
	
Figure 11-4: 
Verifying 
the user 
account 
information.
	
	
10.	Verify that the information is correct and then click Finish to create 
the account.
	
	 If the account information isn’t correct, click the Back button, and correct 
the error.
You’re done! Now you can customize the user’s account settings. At minimum, 
you’ll probably want to add the user to one or more groups. You may also 
want to add contact information for the user or set up other account options.
Setting User Properties
After you create a user account, you can set additional properties for the user 
by right-clicking the new user and choosing Properties from the contextual 
menu. This command brings up the User Properties dialog box, which has 
about a million tabs that you can use to set various properties for the user. 
Figure 11-5 shows the General tab, which lists basic information about the 
user, such as the user’s name, office location, and phone number.

188
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Figure 11-5: 
The General 
tab.
	
The following sections describe some of the administrative tasks that you 
can perform via the various tabs of the User Properties dialog box.
Changing the user’s contact information
Several tabs of the User Properties dialog box contain contact information for 
the user, such as
	
✓	Address: Change the user’s street address, post office box, city, state, 
zip code, and so on.
	
✓	Telephones: Specify the user’s phone numbers.
	
✓	Organization: Record the user’s job title and the name of his boss.
Setting account options
The Account tab of the User Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 11-6, 
features a variety of interesting options that you can set for the user. You 
can change the user’s logon name, change the password options that you set 
when you created the account, and set an expiration date for the account.

189
 Chapter 11: Managing Windows User Accounts
	
Figure 11-6: 
Set user 
account info 
here.
	
The following account options are available in the Account Options list box:
	
✓	User Must Change Password at Next Logon: This default option allows 
you to create a one-time-only password that can get the user started 
with the network. The first time the user logs on to the network, he is 
asked to change the password.
	
✓	User Cannot Change Password: Use this option if you don’t want to 
allow users to change their passwords. (Obviously, you can’t use this 
option and the preceding one at the same time.)
	
✓	Password Never Expires: Use this option to bypass the password-
expiration policy for this user so that the user will never have to 
change her password.
	
✓	Store Password Using Reversible Encryption: This option stores pass­
words by using an encryption scheme that hackers can easily break, so 
you should avoid it like the plague.
	
✓	Account Is Disabled: This option allows you to create an account 
that you don’t yet need. As long as the account remains disabled, the 
user won’t be able to log on. See the upcoming section, “Disabling and 
Enabling User Accounts,” to find out how to enable a disabled account.
	
✓	Smart Card Is Required for Interactive Logon: If the user’s computer 
has a smart card reader to read security cards automatically, select this 
option to require the user to use it.

190
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
✓	Account Is Trusted for Delegation: This option indicates that the 
account is trustworthy and can set up delegations. This advanced fea­
ture usually is reserved for Administrator accounts.
	
✓	Account Is Sensitive and Cannot Be Delegated: This option prevents 
other users from impersonating this account.
	
✓	Use DES Encryption Types for This Account: This option beefs up the 
encryption for applications that require extra security.
	
✓	Do Not Require Kerberos Preauthentication: Kerberos refers to a 
common security protocol used to authenticate users. Select this option 
only if you are using a different type of security.
Specifying logon hours
You can restrict the hours during which the user is allowed to log on to 
the system. Click the Logon Hours button on the Account tab of the User 
Properties dialog box to open the Logon Hours for [User] dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 11-7.
	
Figure 11-7: 
Restrict a 
user’s logon 
hours.
	
Initially, the Logon Hours dialog box is set to allow the user to log on at any 
time of day or night. To change the hours that you want the user to have 
access, click a day and time or a range of days and times, select Logon

 Chapter 11: Managing Windows User Accounts
Restricting access to certain computers
Typically, a user can use his user account to log on to any computer that’s 
part of the user’s domain. You can restrict a user to certain computers, 
however, by clicking the Log On To button on the Account tab of the User 
Properties dialog box. This button brings up the Logon Workstations dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 11-8.
	
Figure 11-8: 
Restricting 
the user 
to certain 
computers.
	
To restrict the user to certain computers, select the The Following Computers 
radio button. Then, for each computer you want to allow the user to log on 
from, enter the computer’s name in the text box and click Add.
	
If you make a mistake, you can select the incorrect computer name and then 
click Edit to change the name. or click Remove to delete the name.
Setting the user’s profile information
From the Profile tab, as shown in Figure 11-9, you can configure three bits of 
information about the user’s profile information:

192
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Figure 11-9: 
The Profile 
tab.
	
	
✓	Profile Path: This field specifies the location of the user’s roaming 
profile.
	
✓	Logon Script: This field is the name of the user’s logon script. A logon 
script is a batch file that’s run whenever the user logs on. The main 
purpose of the logon script is to map the network shares that the user 
requires access to. Logon scripts are carryovers from early versions of 
Windows NT Server. In Windows Server 2012, profiles are the preferred 
way to configure the user’s computer when the user logs on, including 
setting up network shares. Many administrators still like the simplic­
ity of logon scripts, however. For more information, see the section 
“Creating a Logon Script,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Home Folder: This section is where you specify the default storage 
location for the user.
	
From the Profile tab, you can specify the location of an existing profile for the 
user, but it doesn’t actually let you set up the profile.

 Chapter 11: Managing Windows User Accounts
Resetting User Passwords
By some estimates, the single most time-consuming task of most network 
administrators is resetting user passwords. Lest you assume that all users 
are forgetful idiots, put yourself in their shoes, being made to set their 
passwords to something incomprehensible (94kD82leL384K) that they have 
change a week later to something more unmemorable (dJUQ63DWd8331) that 
they don’t write down. Then network admins get mad when they forget their 
passwords.
Sooo, when a user calls and says that she forgot her password, the least 
you can do is (appear to) be cheerful when you reset it. After all, the user 
probably spent 15 minutes trying to remember it before finally giving up and 
admitting failure.
Here’s the procedure to reset the password for a user domain account:
	
1.	Log on as an administrator.
	
	 You must have administrator privileges to perform this procedure.
	
2.	Choose Start➪Administrative Tools➪Active Directory Users and 
Computers.
	
	The Active Directory Users and Computers management console appears. 
	
3.	In the Active Directory Users and Computers management console, 
click Users in the console tree.
	
	Refer back to Figure 11-1.
	
4.	In the Details pane, right-click the user who forgot her password and 
then choose Reset Password from the contextual menu.
	
	A dialog box appears allowing you to change the password.
	
5.	Enter the new password in both password boxes.
	
	 Enter the password twice to ensure that you input it correctly.
	
6.	(Optional) Select the User Must Change Password at Next Logon option.
	
	 If you select this option, the password that you assign will work for only 
one logon. As soon as the user logs on, she will be required to change 
the password.
	
7.	Click OK.
	
	 That’s all there is to it! The user’s password is reset.

194
Part III: Working with Servers 
Disabling and Enabling User Accounts
To temporarily prevent a user from accessing the network, you can disable 
his account. You can always enable the account later, when you’re ready to 
restore the user to full access. Here’s the procedure:
	
1.	Log on as an administrator.
	
	 You must have administrator privileges to perform this procedure.
	
2.	From Server Manager, choose Tools➪Active Directory Users and 
Computers.
	
3.	In the Active Directory Users and Computers management console 
that appears, click Users in the console tree.
	
4.	In the Details pane, right-click the user that you want to enable or 
disable; then choose either Enable Account or Disable Account from 
the contextual menu to enable or disable the user, respectively.
Deleting a User
People come, and people go. And when they go, so should their user account. 
Deleting a user account is surprisingly easy. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Log on as an administrator.
	
	 You must have administrator privileges to perform this procedure.
	
2.	Choose Start➪Administrative Tools➪Active Directory Users and 
Computers.
	
3.	In the Active Directory Users and Computers management console 
that appears, click Users in the console tree.
	
4.	In the Details pane, right-click the user that you want to delete and 
then choose Delete from the contextual menu.
	
	 Windows asks whether you really want to delete the user, just in case 
you’re kidding.
	
5.	Click Yes.
	
	 Poof! The user account is deleted.
	
Deleting a user account is a permanent, nonreversible action. Do it only if 
you’re absolutely sure that you never ever want to restore the user’s account. 
If there’s any possibility of restoring the account later, disable the account 
instead of deleting it. (See the preceding section.)

195
 Chapter 11: Managing Windows User Accounts
Working with Groups
A group is a special type of account that represents a set of users who have 
common network access needs. Groups can dramatically simplify the task of 
assigning network access rights to users. Rather than assign access rights to 
each user individually, you can assign rights to the group itself. Then those 
rights automatically extend to any user you add to the group.
The following sections describe some of the key concepts that you need to 
understand to use groups, along with some of the most common procedures 
you’ll employ when setting up groups for your server.
Creating a group
Here’s how to create a group:
	
1.	Log on as an administrator.
	
	 You must have administrator privileges to perform this procedure.
	
2.	From Server Manager, choose Tools➪Active Directory Users and 
Computers.
	
	 The Active Directory Users and Computers management console appears.
	
3.	Right-click the domain to which you want to add the group and then 
choose New➪Group from the contextual menu.
	
4.	In the New Object – Group dialog box that appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-10, enter the name for the new group.
	
	 Enter the name in both text boxes.
	
Figure 11-10: 
Create a 
new group.
	

196
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
5.	Choose the group scope.
	
	 The choices are
 
• Domain Local: For groups that will be granted access rights to net­
work resources
 
• Global: For groups to which you’ll add users and Domain Local 
groups
 
• Universal: If you have a large network with multiple domains
	
6.	Choose the group type.
	
	 The choices are Security and Distribution. In most cases, choose 
Security.
	
7.	Click OK.
	
	 The group is created. However, at this point, it has no members. To 
remedy that, keep reading.
Adding a member to a group
Groups are collections of objects called members. The members of a group 
can be user accounts or other groups. A newly created group (see the pre­
ceding section) has no members. As you can see, a group isn’t useful until 
you add at least one member.
Follow these steps to add a member to a group:
	
1.	Log on as an administrator.
	
	 You must have administrator privileges to perform this procedure.
	
2.	Choose Start➪Administrative Tools➪Active Directory Users and 
Computers.
	
	 The Active Directory Users and Computers management console 
appears.
	
3.	Open the folder that contains the group to which you want to add 
members and then double-click the group.
	
	 The Group Properties dialog box appears.
	
4.	Click the Members tab.
	
	 The members of the group are displayed, as shown in Figure 11-11.

197
 Chapter 11: Managing Windows User Accounts
	
Figure 11-11: 
Adding 
members to 
a group.
	
	
5.	Click Add, type the name of a user or other group that you want to 
add to this group, and then click OK.
	
	 The member is added to the list.
	
6.	Repeat Step 5 for each user that you want to add.
	
	 Keep going until you add everyone!
	
7.	Click OK.
That’s all there is to it.
	
On the Member Of tab of the Group Properties dialog box, you can see a list of 
each group that the current group is a member of.
Creating a Logon Script
A logon script is a batch file that’s run automatically whenever a user logs 
on. The most common reason for using a logon script is to map the network 
shares that the user needs access to. Here’s a simple logon script that maps 
three network shares:
echo off
net use m: \\server1\shares\admin
net use n: \\server1\shares\mktg
net use o: \\server2\archives

198
Part III: Working with Servers 
Here, two shares on server1 are mapped to drives M: and N:, and a share on 
server2 is mapped as drive O:.
If you want, you can use the special variable %username% to get the user’s 
username. This variable is useful if you created a folder for each user, and 
you want to map a drive to each user’s folder, as follows:
net use u: \\server1\users\%username%
If a user logs on with the username dlowe, for example, drive U: is mapped to 
\\server1\users\dlowe.
	
Scripts should be saved in the Scripts folder, which is buried deep in the 
bowels of the SYSVOL folder — typically, here:
c:\Windows\SYSVOL\Sysvol\domainname\Scripts
where domainname is your domain name. Because you need to access this 
folder frequently, I suggest creating a shortcut to it on your desktop.
After you create a logon script, you can assign it to a user by using the Profile 
tab of the User Properties dialog box. For more information, see the section 
“Setting the user’s profile information,” earlier in this chapter.

Managing Network Storage
In This Chapter

O

ne key purpose of most computer networks is to provide shared access 
to disk storage. In this chapter, you find out about several ways that a 
network can provide shared disk storage. Then you discover how to config­
ure Windows Server 2012 to operate as a file server.
Understanding Network Storage
Many network servers exist solely for the purpose of making disk space avail­
able to network users. As networks grow to support more users and as users 
require more disk space, network administrators are continually finding ways 
to add more storage to their networks. The following sections describe some 
key concepts for providing network storage.
File servers
A file server is simply a network server whose primary role is to share its disk 
drives. Using a file server is the most common way to provide shared network 
storage.
A file server can be anything from a simple desktop computer that has been 
pressed into service as a file server to an expensive ($25,000 or more) server 
with redundant components so that the server can continue to run when a 
component fails. A file server can even consist of advanced disk subsystems 
with racks of disk drives that can be replaced without shutting down the 
server.

200
Part III: Working with Servers 
One of the most common advanced disk subsystems for file servers is 
Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID). A RAID system, which is a type 
of disk storage that hardly ever fails, works by lumping together several disk 
drives and treating them as though they’re a single humongous drive. RAID 
uses some fancy techniques devised by computer nerds at Berkeley. These 
techniques ensure that if one of the disk drives in the RAID system fails, no 
data is lost. The disk drive that failed can be removed and repaired, and the 
data that was on it can be reconstructed from the other drives.
	
Most of this chapter is devoted to showing you how to configure Windows 
Server 2012 to run as a file server.
Storage appliances
A storage appliance is a device specifically designed for providing shared 
network storage. Also known as Network Attached Storage (NAS), it’s a self-
contained file server that’s preconfigured and ready to run. All you have to 
do to set it up is take it out of the box, plug it in, and turn it on. Storage appli­
ances are easy to set up and configure, easy to maintain, and less expensive 
than traditional file servers.
A typical entry-level storage appliance is the Dell PowerVault NX300. This 
self-contained file server is built into a small rack-mount chassis. It sup­
ports up to four hard drives with a total capacity of up to 12 terabytes (TB; 
that’s 12,000GB). The Dell NX300 runs a special version of Windows Server: 
Windows Storage Server. This version of Windows, designed specifically for 
NAS devices, allows you to configure the network storage from any computer 
on the network by using a web browser.
Note that some storage appliances use customized versions of Linux rather 
than Windows Storage Server. Also, in some systems, the operating system 
(OS) resides on a separate hard drive that’s isolated from the shared disks so 
users are prevented from inadvertently damaging the OS.
Understanding Permissions
Before I get into the details of setting up a file server, you need to have a 
solid understanding of the concept of permissions. Permissions allow users to 
access shared resources on a network. Simply sharing a resource, such as a 
disk folder or a printer, doesn’t guarantee that a given user is able to access 
that resource. Windows makes this decision based on the permissions that 
have been assigned to various groups for the resource and group member­
ships of the user. For example, if the user belongs to a group that has been 
granted permission to access the resource, the access is allowed. If not, 
access is denied.

201
 Chapter 12: Managing Network Storage
In theory, permissions sound pretty simple. In practice, however, they 
can get pretty complicated. The following paragraphs explain some of the 
nuances of how access control and permissions work:
	
✓	Every object — that is, every file and folder — on an NTFS volume has a 
set of permissions — the Access Control List (ACL) — associated with it.
	
✓	The ACL identifies which users and groups can access the object and 
specifies what level of access each user or group has. A folder’s ACL 
may specify that one group of users can read files in the folder, whereas 
another group can read and write files in the folder, and a third group is 
denied access to the folder.
	
✓	Container objects — files and volumes — allow their ACLs to be inher­
ited by the objects that they contain. As a result, if you specify permis­
sions for a folder, those permissions extend to the files and child folders 
that appear within it.
Table 12-1 lists the six permissions that can be applied to files and folders on 
an NTFS volume.
Table 12-1	
File and Folder Permissions
Permission
Description
Full Control
The user has unrestricted access to the file or folder.
Modify
The user can change the file or folder’s contents, delete the 
file or folder, read the file or folder, or change the attributes 
of the file or folder. For a folder, this permission allows you 
to create new files or subfolders within the folder.
Read & Execute
For a file, this permission grants the right to read or execute 
the file. For a folder, this permission grants the right to list 
the contents of the folder or to read or execute any of the 
files in the folder.
List Folder 
Contents
This permission applies only to folders; it grants the right to 
list the contents of the folder.
Read
This permission grants the right to read the contents of a file 
or folder.
Write
This permission grants the right to change the contents of a 
file or its attributes. For a folder, this permission grants the 
right to create new files and subfolders within the folder.
Actually, the six file and folder permissions comprise various combinations 
of special permissions that grant more detailed access to files or folders. 
Table 12-2 lists the special permissions that apply to each of the six file and 
folder permissions.

202
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Assign permissions to groups rather than to individual users. that way, if a 
particular user needs access to a particular resource, add that user to a group 
that has permission to use the resource.

Understanding Shares
A share is simply a folder that is made available to other users via the net­
work. Each share has the following elements:
	
✓	Share name: The name by which the share is known over the network
	
✓	Path: The path to the folder on the local computer that’s being shared, 
such as C:\Accounting

203
 Chapter 12: Managing Network Storage
	
✓	Description: A one-line description of the share
	
✓	Permissions: A list of users or groups who have been granted access to 
the share
When you install Windows and configure various server roles, special shared 
resources are created to support those roles. You shouldn’t disturb these 
special shares unless you know what you’re doing. Table 12-3 lists some of 
the most common special shares.
Table 12-3	
Special Shares
Share Name
Description
drive$
The root directory of a drive.
ADMIN$
Used for remote administration of a computer. This share points 
to the OS folder (usually, C: \Windows). 
IPC$
Used by named pipes, a programming feature that lets pro­
cesses communicate with one another. 
NETLOGON
Required for domain controllers to function. 
SYSVOL
Another required domain controller share.
PRINT$
Used for remote administration of printers.
FAX$
Used by fax clients.
Notice that some of the special shares end with a dollar sign ($). These shares 
are hidden shares, not visible to users. You can still access them, however, by 
typing the complete share name (including the dollar sign) when the share is 
needed. The special share C$, for example, is created to allow you to connect 
to the root directory of the C: drive from a network client. You wouldn’t want 
your users to see this share, would you? (Shares such as C$ are also protected 
by privileges, of course, so if an ordinary user finds out that C$ is the root 
directory of the server’s C: drive, he still can’t access it.)
Managing Your File Server
To manage shares on a Windows Server 2012 system, open the Server 
Manager, and select File and Storage Services in the task pane on the left side 
of the window. Then click Shares to reveal the management console shown in 
Figure 12-1.

204
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Figure 12-1: 
Managing 
shares in 
Windows 
Server 2012.
	
The following sections describe some of the most common procedures that 
you’ll use when managing your file server.
Using the New Share Wizard
To be useful, a file server should offer one or more shares — folders that 
have been designated as publicly accessible via the network. To create a new 
share, use the New Share Wizard:
	
1.	In Server Manager, select File and Storage Services, click Shares and 
then choose New Share from the Tasks drop-down menu.
	
	 The opening screen of the New Share Wizard appears, as shown in 
Figure 12-2. Here, the wizard asks you what folder you want to share.
	
2.	Select SMB Share – Quick in the list of profiles and then click Next.
	
	 The New Share Wizard asks for the location of the share, as shown in 
Figure 12-3.

asks where 
you’d like to 
locate the 
share.
	
	
3.	Select the server where you want the share to reside.
	
4.	Select the location of the share by choosing one of these two options:
 
• Select by Volume: This option selects the volume on which the 
shared folder will reside while letting the New Share Wizard create 
a folder for you. If you select this option, the wizard will create 
the shared folder on the designated volume. Use this option if the 
folder doesn’t yet exist and you don’t mind Windows placing it in 

206
Part III: Working with Servers 
the default location, which is inside a folder called Shares on the 
volume you specify.
 
• Type a Custom Path: Use this option if the folder exists or if you 
want to create one in a location other than the Shares folder.
	
5.	Click Next.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 12-4 appears.
	
Figure 12-4: 
The wizard 
asks for  
the share  
name and 
description.
	
	
6.	Enter the name that you want to use for the share in the Share Name 
field.
	
	 The default name is the name of the folder being shared. If the folder 
name is long, you can use a more succinct name here.
	
7.	Enter a description for the share.
	
8.	Click Next.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 12-5 appears.
	
9.	Select the share settings you’d like to use:
 
• Enable Access-Based Enumeration: Hides files that the user does 
not have permission to access
 
• Allow Caching of Share: Makes the files available to offline users
 
• Encrypt Data Access: Encrypts files accessed via the share
	
10.	Click Next.
	
	The wizard displays the default permissions that will be used for the 
new share, as shown in Figure 12-6.

Sharing a folder without the wizard
If you think wizards should be confined to Harry Potter movies, you can set up 
a share without bothering with the wizard. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Press the Windows key, click Computer, and navigate to the folder 
that you want to share.
	
2.	Right-click the folder and choose Properties from the contextual 
menu.
	
	 This action brings up the Properties dialog box for the folder.
	
3.	Click the Sharing tab.
	
	 The Sharing tab comes to the front, as shown in Figure 12-9.
	
Figure 12-9: 
Manually 
share a 
folder.
	
	
4.	Click the Advanced Sharing button.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 12-10 appears.
	
5.	Select the Share This Folder check box to designate the folder as 
shared.
	
	 The rest of the controls in this dialog box are unavailable until you 
select this check box.

210
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Figure 12-10: 
Set the 
share name.
	
	
6.	Enter the name that you want to use for the share in the Share Name 
field and then enter a description of the share in the Comments field.
	
	 The default name is the name of the folder being shared. If the folder 
name is long, you can use a more succinct name here.
	
	 The description is strictly optional but sometimes helps users deter­
mine the intended contents of the folder.
	
7.	Click the Permissions button and then set the permissions you want to 
apply to the share.
	
	 For more information, see the next section. 
	
8.	Click OK.
	
	 The folder is now shared.
Granting permissions
When you first create a file share, all users are granted read-only access to 
the share. If you want to allow users to modify files in the share or allow them 
to create new files, you need to add permissions. Here’s how to do this via 
the Share and Storage Management console:
	
1.	Open Windows Explorer by pressing the Windows key and clicking 
Computer; then browse to the folder whose permissions you want to 
manage.
	
2.	Right-click the folder you want to manage and then choose Properties 
from the contextual menu.
	
	The Properties dialog box for the folder appears.

211
 Chapter 12: Managing Network Storage
	
3.	Click the Sharing tab; then click Advanced Sharing.
	
	 The Advanced Sharing dialog box appears.
	
4.	Click Permissions.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 12-11 appears. This dialog box lists all 
the users and groups to whom you’ve granted permission for the folder. 
Initially, read permissions are granted to a group called Everyone, which 
means that anyone can view files in the share but no one can create, 
modify, or delete files in the share.
	
	 When you select a user or group from the list, the check boxes at the 
bottom of the list change to indicate which specific permissions you’ve 
assigned to each user or group.
	
Figure 12-11: 
Set the 
share 
permissions.
	
	
5.	Click the Add button.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 12-12 appears.
	
Figure 12-12: 
Adding 
permissions.
	

212
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
6.	Enter the name of the user or group to whom you want to grant per­
mission and then click OK.
	
	 If you’re not sure of the name, click the Advanced button. This action 
brings up a dialog box from which you can search for existing users. 
	
	 When you click OK, you return to the Share Permissions tab (refer to 
Figure 12-11), with the new user or group added.
	
7.	Select the appropriate Allow and Deny check boxes to specify which 
permissions to allow for the user or group.
	
8.	Repeat Steps 5–7 for any other permissions that you want to add.
	
9.	When you’re done, click OK.
Here are a few other thoughts to ponder concerning adding permissions:
	
✓	If you want to grant full access to everyone for this folder, don’t bother 
adding another permission. Instead, select the Everyone group and then 
select the Allow check box for each permission type.
	
✓	You can remove a permission by selecting the permission and then 
clicking the Remove button.
	
✓	If you’d rather not fuss with the Share and Storage Management console, 
you can set the permissions from My Computer. Right-click the shared 
folder, choose Sharing and Security from the contextual menu, and then 
click Permissions. Then you can follow the preceding procedure, picking 
up at Step 5.
	
✓	The permissions assigned in this procedure apply only to the share 
itself. The underlying folder can also have permissions assigned to it. If 
that’s the case, whichever of the restrictions is most restrictive always 
applies. If the share permissions grant a user Full Control permission 
but the folder permission grants the user only Read permission, for 
example, the user has only Read permission for the folder.

lthough not strictly a part of Windows Server 2012, Exchange Server 
2010 is the mail server software that’s used on most Windows networks. 
Yes, I know Microsoft doesn’t call Exchange Server a “mail server.” It’s a 
“messaging and collaboration server.” But the basic reason for Exchange 
Server’s existence is e-mail. The other messaging and collaboration features 
are just icing on the cake.
In this chapter, you discover how to perform the most commonly requested 
maintenance chores for Exchange Server, such as how to create a new mailbox, 
grant a user access to an additional mailbox, and deal with mailbox size limits.
Creating a Mailbox
In previous versions of Exchange, you created user mailboxes using Active 
Directory Users and Computers (ADUC). With Exchange 2010, however, 
Microsoft has removed the Exchange management features of ADUC. So 
instead, you create and manage user mailboxes using Exchange Management 
Console, which you can find in Server Manager on the Tools menu.
The Exchange Management Console lets you create a mailbox for an existing 
Active Directory (AD) user. (Refer to Chapter 11 for information about creat­
ing Active Directory users.) Or you can use Exchange Management Console 
to create a new user with a mailbox. Because that’s the most likely case, the 
following procedure describes the steps you should follow to create a new 
AD user with a mailbox:
	
1.	From Server Manager, choose Tools➪Microsoft Exchange Server 
2010➪Exchange Management Console.
	
	 This fires up the Exchange Management Console, as shown in Figure 13-1.

Exchange 
Management 
Console.
	
	
2.	In the Navigation pane (left side of the window), navigate to Microsoft 
Exchange➪Microsoft Exchange On-Premises➪Recipient Configuration.
	
	If you have more than one Exchange server, pick the Microsoft Exchange 
On-Premises node for the server you want to add the user to.
	
3.	Right-click the Mailbox node in the navigation pane and choose New 
Mailbox.
	
	 This summons the New Mailbox Wizard, as shown in Figure 13-2. From 
here, the first page of the wizard, you choose among several different 
types of mailbox accounts you can create.
	
4.	Select the User Mailbox radio button and then click Next.
	
	This brings up the User Type page, as shown in Figure 13-3. Here, you 
indicate whether you want to create a new user account or add a mail­
box for an existing AD user.

6.	Enter the user’s first name, middle initial, and last name.
	
	 As you type the name, the New Mailbox Wizard automatically fills in the 
Name field.
	
7.	(Optional) Change the Name field if you want it to appear different 
from what was proposed.
	
	 You may want to reverse the first and last names so the last name 
appears first, for example.
	
8.	Enter the user logon name.
	
	 This name must be unique within the domain and will be used to form 
the user’s e-mail address.
	
9.	Enter the password twice.
	
	 You’re asked to type the password twice, so type it correctly. If you 
don’t type it identically in both boxes, you’re asked to correct your 
mistake.

217
 Chapter 13: Managing Exchange Server 2010
	
10.	If the password is temporary, select the User Must Change Password at 
Next Logon check box.
	
	 This setting requires the user to change the temporary password the 
first time he logs on.
	
11.	Click Next.
	
	The Mailbox Settings page is displayed, as shown in Figure 13-5, where 
you can create an alias for the user’s account name and also set several 
Exchange options for the user’s mailbox.

12.	Enter an alias for the user and then click Next.
	
	The alias can be the same as the name that was used in the Name field 
on the previous page of the wizard, or you can type a different name if 
you want.
	
	 When you click Next, the page shown in Figure 13-6 is displayed.

option deselected.
	
	Archive mailboxes are available only with the Enterprise Edition of 
Exchange Server 2010, so don’t even think about this option unless 
you’ve shelled out the money for Enterprise Edition.
	
14.	Click Next.
	
	 You’re taken to the final page of the New Mailbox Wizard, as shown in 
Figure 13-7.
	
15.	Verify that the information is correct and then click New to create the 
mailbox.
	
	 If the account information is not correct, click the Back button and 
correct the error.
	
	 When you click Next, Exchange Management Console displays various and 
sundry messages and progress bars as it creates the user account and 
its mailbox. When it’s finished, the Completion page shown in Figure 13-8 
is displayed.

Managing Mailboxes
After you set up a mailbox, you can use the Exchange Management Console to 
manage the basic settings of the mailbox. To do that, right-click the mailbox 
you want to manage and choose the Properties command from the contextual 
menu. This action brings up the Properties dialog box, which is the portal 
that grants access to many of the most frequently used features of Exchange.
The following sections describe several commonly used features that are 
controlled via this dialog box.
Enabling mailbox features
Exchange Mailbox Features refers to several features of Exchange mailboxes 
that are controlled via the Mailbox Features tab of the mailbox Properties 
dialog box. This tab is shown in Figure 13-9.
	
Figure 13-9: 
The Mailbox 
Features 
tab.
	

221
 Chapter 13: Managing Exchange Server 2010
The following paragraphs describe the features that are controlled from 
this tab:
	
✓	Outlook Web App: Lets the user access her Exchange mailbox from 
a web browser rather than from an Outlook client. With this feature 
enabled, the user can read e-mail from any computer that has an 
Internet connection. This feature used to be called Outlook Web Access.
	
✓	Exchange ActiveSync: Activates the ActiveSync feature, which allows 
Exchange data to synchronize with mobile devices, such as iPhones or 
Windows Mobile phones.
	
✓	Unified Messaging: Enables a premium feature (available only with 
Enterprise Edition) that integrates voice mail and fax messages with 
Exchange mailboxes.
	
✓	MAPI: Enables e-mail using the MAPI protocol. This protocol is enabled 
by default and is the most common way to access e-mail with Microsoft 
Outlook.
	
✓	POP3: Enables e-mail using the POP3 protocol. POP3 is disabled by 
default and should be enabled only if the user will need to access e-mail 
using an e-mail client that requires the POP3 protocol.
	
✓	IMAP4: Enables e-mail using the IMAP4 protocol. IMAP4 is disabled by 
default and should be enabled only if required to support an IMAP4 
e-mail client.
	
✓	Archive: Enables the Exchange Archive feature, which (as I mention 
earlier) is available only with the Enterprise edition of Exchange.
Creating a forwarder
A forwarder is a feature that automatically forwards any incoming e-mail to 
another e-mail address. This feature is most often used when an employee 
is on vacation or leave, and the employee’s manager requests that someone 
else temporarily handle the absent employee’s e-mail.
To configure a forwarder, follow these steps:
	
1.	In Server Manager, choose Tools➪Microsoft Exchange Server 2010➪
Exchange Management Console.
	
	 This command fires up the Exchange Management Console (refer to 
Figure 13-1).
	
2.	In the Navigation pane, navigate to Microsoft Exchange➪Microsoft 
Exchange On-Premises➪Recipient Configuration.

222
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
3.	Right-click the mailbox for the user whose e-mail you want to forward 
and then choose Properties from the contextual menu.
	
	 This summons the mailbox Properties dialog box.
	
4.	Click the Mail Flow Settings tab.
	
	The Mail Flow settings are displayed, as shown in Figure 13-10.
	
Figure 13-10: 
The Mail 
Flow 
Settings tab.
	
	
5.	Double-click Delivery Options.
	
	The Delivery Options dialog box appears.
	
6.	Select the Forward To check box.
	
7.	Click the Browse button.
	
	The Select Recipient dialog box appears.
	
8.	Select the recipient you want to forward the e-mail to and then 
click OK.
	
	The name you selected is displayed in the text box next to the Browse 
button in the Delivery Options dialog box.
	
9.	(Optional) If you want the e-mail to be delivered to this user’s mailbox 
in addition to the forwarding address, select the Deliver Message to 
Both Forwarding Address and Mailbox check box.
	
	If you leave this option deselected, only the forwarding address will 
receive the e-mail; the mail won’t be delivered to this user’s mailbox.

223
 Chapter 13: Managing Exchange Server 2010
	
10.	Click OK to close the Delivery Options dialog box.
	
	 You return to the mailbox Properties dialog box.
	
11.	Click OK to dismiss the Properties dialog box.
Setting mailbox storage limits
Exchange lets you set a limit on the size of each user’s mailbox. In a very 
small organization, you can probably get away without imposing strict mail­
box size limits. If your organization has 20 or more users, though, you need 
to limit the size of each user’s mailbox to prevent the Exchange private mail 
store from getting out of hand.
Exchange provides three kinds of storage limits for user mailboxes:
	
✓	Issue Warning At: When this limit is exceeded, an e-mail warning is sent 
to the user to let him know that his mailbox is getting large.
	
✓	Prohibit Send At: When this limit is reached, the user can’t send e-mail, 
but the mailbox continues to receive e-mail. The user won’t be able to 
send e-mails again until she deletes enough e-mails to reduce the mail­
box size below the limit.
	
✓	Prohibit Send and Receive At: When this limit is reached, the mailbox 
shuts down and can neither send nor receive e-mails.
You can (and should) set a default storage limit that applies to all mailboxes 
in your organization. You can also override these limits for specific users. 
The limits you set will depend on many factors, including the number of 
users in your organization, the type of e-mail they typically use (for example, 
do they require large attachments?), and the amount of disk space available 
on your Exchange server.
To configure the default storage limits for all mailboxes, follow these steps:
	
1.	In Server Manager, choose Tools➪Microsoft Exchange Server 2010➪
Exchange Management Console.
	
	 This command fires up the Exchange Management Console (refer to 
Figure 13-1).
	
2.	In the Navigation pane, navigate to Microsoft Exchange➪Microsoft 
Exchange On-Premises➪Organization Configuration➪Mailbox.
	
	The organization’s mailbox configuration displays, as shown in Figure 13-11.

224
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Figure 13-11: 
The Orga-
nization 
Mailbox 
page of the 
Exchange 
Management 
Console.
	
	
3.	In the list of mailbox databases, right-click the mailbox database and 
then choose Properties from the contextual menu.
	
	 Usually, only one mailbox database is listed; the mailbox database is 
highlighted in Figure 13-11.
	
	 When you choose Properties, the Mailbox Database Properties dialog 
box is displayed.
	
4.	Click the Limits tab.
	
	The Limits tab is displayed, as shown in Figure 13-12.
	
5.	Change the Storage Limits settings to meet your needs.
	
	By default, the storage limits are set quite high: Warnings are issued 
at about 1.9GB, send permission is revoked at 2GB, and both send and 
receive permissions are revoked at about 2.4GB. A 2GB allowance for 
each user’s mailbox is generous, but bear in mind that if you have 100 
users, your mailbox database may grow to 200GB. You may want to set 
lower limits.

225
 Chapter 13: Managing Exchange Server 2010
	
Figure 13-12: 
Set default 
storage 
limits.
	
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	The limits you set take effect immediately.
If you impose restrictive default storage limits for your users, you may want 
to relax the limits on a case-by-case basis. Some users may require a larger 
mailbox because of the type of work they do, and you probably don’t want to 
impose a tight limit on your boss.
Fortunately, overriding the default limits for a specific user is easy. Here are 
the steps:
	
1.	In Exchange Management Console, navigate to Microsoft Exchange➪
Microsoft Exchange On-Premises➪Recipient Configuration➪Mailbox.
	
2.	Right-click the user for whom you want to override the limits and 
choose Properties.
	
	 This summons the Mailbox Properties dialog box.
	
3.	Click the Mailbox Settings tab.
	
4.	Double-click Storage Quotas.
	
	The Storage Quotas dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-13.

226

Figure 13-13: 
Customize 
storage 
quotas here.
	
	
5.	Deselect the Use Mailbox Database Defaults check box in the Storage 
Quotas section.
	
	This option enables the controls that let you set the Issue Warning, 
Prohibit Send, and Prohibit Send and Receive limits.
	
6.	Set the appropriate limits for the user.
	
7.	Click OK.
	
	The storage limits are configured.
	
You can configure many other features of Exchange via the Exchange 
Management Console. You should take some time to explore all the nodes in 
the navigation pane and to examine the Properties dialog boxes for the vari­
ous types of Exchange objects that appear when you select each node.
Configuring Outlook for Exchange
After you create an Exchange mailbox for a user, you can configure that 
user’s Outlook client software to connect to the user’s account. Although you 
can do this configuration directly within Outlook, it’s better to do it outside 
Outlook, using the Control Main Mail applet. Here are the steps:
	
1.	Open Control Panel and then open the Mail applet.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 13-14 appears.
	
2.	Click the Show Profiles button.
	
	The dialog box shown in Figure 13-15 appears, listing the mail profiles 
that already exist on the computer.

N

o, I’m not mispronouncing Internet, although an intranet is similar to the 
Internet, but with a twist. Rather than connect your computer to millions 
of other computers around the world, an intranet connects your computer to 
other computers in your company or organization. How is an intranet different 
from your ordinary, run-of-the-mill network? Read on, and I’ll explain.
Defining an Intranet
Everyone knows that the Internet, and especially the World Wide Web, is a 
phenomenon. Millions of computer users worldwide surf the web, sharing 
and downloading files.
Companies realized that such a platform would help employees share and 
access data and documents. But understandably, not many companies wanted 
their proprietary and private info all over the web. So ingenious network man­
agers at large companies figured out that although “the” web is a great conduit 
for distributing public information around the world, “a” web — a private 
internal web — is even better for distributing sensitive information within a 
company. Thus, the idea of intranets was born. An intranet is simply a network 
that’s built by using the same tools and protocols that are used by the global 
Internet but applied instead to an organization’s internal network.

232
Part III: Working with Servers 
	
Think of an intranet as a small, private version of the World Wide Web. 
Anyone who connects to your local area network (LAN) can access your 
intranet. The intranet is accessed by using a web browser, such as Internet 
Explorer or Firefox. However, users don’t need an Internet connection because 
the information on the intranet is stored on the company’s server computers 
rather than on a computer that must be accessed from the Internet.
	
An intranet is analogous to a closed-circuit television system that can be 
viewed only by people within the organization that owns the system. In con­
trast, the Internet is more like cable television in that anyone who’s willing to 
pay a monthly fee can watch.
Here are two interesting but contradictory points of view about the signifi­
cance of intranets:
	
✓	Some computer industry pundits say that intranets are more popular 
than the Internet. For example, many companies that sell web develop­
ment tools make more money selling software used for intranets than for 
the Internet.
	
✓	On the other hand, other industry pundits think that the intranet phe­
nomenon is merely a fad that some other promising new technology, 
such as pet rocks or hula hoops, will replace in a few years. Only time 
will tell.
Identifying Intranet Uses
Intranets can distribute just about any type of information within a company. 
Intranets use two basic types of applications:
	
✓	Publishing application: Information is posted in the form of pages that 
you can view from any computer with access to the intranet. This type 
of intranet application is commonly used for company newsletters, 
policy manuals, and price lists, for example.
	
	Publishing applications are simple to set up. In fact, you may be able to 
set up one without a lot of outside help from highly paid computer 
consultants.
	
✓	Transaction application: Information is gathered from users of the 
intranet who file online expense reports, report problems to the help 
desk, or enroll in employee benefit programs, for example.
	
	Expect to spend big bucks on computer consulting to get an intranet 
transaction application set up.

233
 Chapter 14: Creating an Intranet
Here’s the key difference between these two types of intranet applications:
	
✓	In a publishing application, information flows in one direction. It flows 
from the intranet to the user. The user requests some information, and 
the intranet system delivers it.
	
✓	In a transaction application, information flows in both directions. Not 
only does the user request information from the intranet system, but the 
intranet system itself also requests information from the user.
Setting Up an Intranet
To properly set up an intranet, you need the right tools. Here’s a list of 
requirements:
	
✓	A network: An intranet doesn’t require its own cabling; it can operate on 
your existing network.
	
✓	A server computer that’s dedicated to the intranet: Make sure that this 
computer has plenty of RAM (at least 4GB) and gigabytes of disk space 
(at least 100GB). Of course, the more users your network has and the 
A webless intranet
The correct way to set up a proper intranet is to 
set up a Windows-based server running IIS or 
a Linux-based server running Apache or some 
other web server. However, you can create a 
rudimentary intranet without going to the trouble 
of setting up an actual web server. Here’s how:
	 1.	 Set up a share on a file server that will hold 
the HTML files that make up your intranet.
	 2.	 Create an HTML file for the home page of 
your intranet, and save the file in the loca­
tion you create in Step 1.
	
	 I recommend that you name it index.html.
	 3.	 Create any other HTML files that your 
intranet needs.
	
	 The index.html file should include links 
to these pages.
	 4.	 Point your web browser to the index.
html file at the shared network location.
	
	 For example, if the server is named 
iserver and the share is named 
intranet, enter this information into 
your browser’s address box: \\iserver\
intranet\index.html. Voilà! — you have an 
instant intranet without the fuss of a web 
server.
This rudimentary intranet works without a web 
server because a web browser can display 
HTML files directly, without the need for a web 
server. However, without a web server, your 
intranet is limited in what it can do. In particu­
lar, all its pages must be static (their content is 
fixed). For dynamic content, which users inter­
act with, you need to set up a web server.

234
Part III: Working with Servers 
more information you intend to place on the server, the more RAM and 
disk storage you need.
	
✓	Windows Server or a Linux operating system: Web server software 
requires one or the other.
	
✓	Web server software for the server computer: You need to install a web 
server, such as IIS (for Windows servers) or Apache (for Linux servers).
	
✓	Programs to help you create web pages: If you’re the type who dreams 
in binary, you can create web pages by typing HTML codes directly 
into text files. In that case, the only program you need is Notepad. 
Alternatively, you can use a program designed specifically for creating 
web pages, such as Microsoft FrontPage, or perhaps something fancier, 
such as Adobe Dreamweaver. If you’re going to develop transaction-
based applications, you need additional tools.
Setting Up an IIS Web Server
IIS is a free component of Windows Server 2012, but it’s not installed by 
default. After you complete installing Windows Server, you must add the 
Web Server role to enable IIS. The following procedure is for Windows Server 
2012, but the procedure for Windows 2008 Server (or 2003, for that matter) is 
similar:
	
1.	Open the Server Manager; then choose Add Roles and Features.
	
	The Add Roles and Features Wizard comes to life.
	
2.	Follow the steps of the Add Roles and Features Wizard up to the Select 
Server Roles step.
	
	The Select Server Roles page is shown in Figure 14-1.
	
3.	Select the Web Server (IIS) check box and then click Next.
	
	The Add Roles and Features Wizard asks whether you want to install the 
related IIS Management Console, as shown in Figure 14-2.
	
4.	Click the Add Features button; then click Next.
	
	 The Select Features page appears.

page lists a variety of optional services that can be configured for IIS.
	
7.	Select the services you want to configure for IIS.
	
	If you want, you can study this list and try to anticipate which features 
you think you’ll need. Or you can just leave the default options selected.
	
	 You can always return to the Add Roles and Features Wizard to add 
features you leave out here.
	
8.	Click Next.
	
	 A confirmation page appears.
	
9.	Click Install.
	
	 The features you selected are installed. This may take a few minutes, so 
now would be a good time to take a walk.
	
	 When the installation finishes, an Installation Results page is displayed 
to verify that IIS was properly installed.
	
10.	Click Close.
	
	 IIS is now installed and ready to use!

Understanding the Default Website
Initially, IIS is configured with a single website: the default website. You can 
test that IIS is up and running by opening a browser window on the server 
and typing localhost in the address bar. You can also reach this page by 
entering your local domain name in the address bar, such as lowewriter.pri. 
Figure 14-5 shows the standard welcome page that appears when you browse 
to the default site.
The actual files that make up the default website are stored on the server’s 
C: drive in a folder named \inetpub\wwwroot. When you browse to the 
default website without requesting a specific file (simply by typing localhost 
in the address bar, for example), IIS looks for the following files, in this order:
	
✓	default.htm
	
✓	default.asp
	
✓	index.htm
	
✓	index.html
	
✓	iisstart.htm
	
✓	default.aspx

Figure 14-5: 
The default 
website.
	
Initially, c:\inetpub\wwwroot contains just two files: iisstart.htm and 
welcome.png. The iisstart.htm file is the file that’s displayed when you 
browse to the website; it contains the HTML markup necessary to display the 
image contained in the welcome.png file, which is the image you actually 
see on the page.
You can preempt the standard page for the default website by providing your 
own file one of the preceding names. You can follow these steps, for example, 
to create a simple default.htm file that displays the words Hello World! as 
the start page for the default website:
	
1.	Open an Explorer window, and browse to c:\inetpub\wwwroot.
	
2.	Choose File➪New➪Text Document, type default.htm for the filename, 
and press Enter.
	
3.	Right-click the default.htm file you just created and choose Open 
With➪Notepad from the contextual menu.
	
4.	Enter the following text in the Notepad window:
<HTML>
<BODY>
<H1>Hello World!</H1>
</BODY>
</HTML>

6.	Open a browser window.
	
7.	Type localhost in the address bar, and press Enter.
	
	The page shown in Figure 14-6 appears.

Creating Websites
IIS has the ability to host multiple websites. This is an extremely useful feature 
not only for web servers that host public sites, but also for web servers that 
host internal (intranet) sites. You might create a separate intranet website for 
Human Resources and assign it the website name hr. Then, assuming that the 
domain name is lowewriter.pri, users can browse to the website by using 
the address hr.lowewriter.pri.
Here are the steps:
	
1.	Using Windows Explorer, create a folder in which you will save the 
files for the new website.
	
	For this example, I created a folder named c:\HR-Web-Site.

240

3.	Right-click Sites and then choose Add Website from the contextual 
menu.
	
	The Add Website dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-8.
	
4.	Enter a name for the website in the Site Name text box.
	
	For this example, I used HR.
	
5.	Click the Browse button (the one with the ellipsis), browse to the 
folder you created in Step 1, and then click OK.
	
	For this example, I browsed to C:\HR-Web-Site.
	
6.	In the Host Name text box, enter the exact DNS name you want to use 
for the site.
	
	For this example, I entered hr.lowewriter.pri.

T

wo of the world’s great science fiction franchises — Star Wars and Star 
Trek — feature cities that are suspended in the clouds. In Star Wars 
Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Han takes the Millennium Falcon to Cloud 
City, hoping that his friend Lando Calrissian can help repair their damaged 
hyperdrive. And in the original Star Trek series episode “The Cloud Minders,” 
the crew of the Enterprise visits a city named Stratos, which is suspended in 
the clouds.
Coincidence? Perhaps. Or maybe Gene Roddenberry and George Lucas 
both knew that the future would be in the clouds. At any rate, the future of 
computer networking is rapidly heading for the clouds. Cloud computing, 
to be specific. This chapter is a brief introduction to cloud computing. You 
discover what it is, the pros and cons of adopting it, and what services are 
provided by the major cloud computer providers.
Introducing Cloud Computing
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to outsource one or more of your 
networked computing resources to the Internet. “The cloud” represents a 
new way of handling common computer tasks. Following are a few examples 
of how the cloud way differs from the traditional way:
	
✓	E-mail services
 
• Traditional: Provide e-mail services is to install Microsoft Exchange 
on a local server computer. Then your clients can connect use 
Microsoft Outlook to connect to the Exchange server to send and 
receive e-mail.

248
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
 
• Cloud: Contract with an Internet-based e-mail provider, such as 
Google Mail (Gmail). Cloud-based e-mail services typically charge 
a low monthly per-user fee, so the amount you pay for your e-mail 
service depends solely on the number of e-mail users you have.
	
✓	Disk storage
 
• Traditional: Set up a local file server computer with a large amount 
of shared disk space.
 
• Cloud: Sign up for an Internet file storage service and then store 
your data on the Internet. Cloud-based file storage typically 
charges a small monthly per-gigabyte fee, so you pay only for the 
storage you use. The disk capacity of cloud-based storage is essen­
tially unlimited.
	
✓	Accounting services
 
• Traditional: Purchase expensive accounting software and install it 
on a local server computer.
 
• Cloud: Sign up for a web-based accounting service. Then all your 
accounting data is saved and managed on the provider’s servers, 
not on yours.
Looking at the Benefits 
of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a different — and, in many ways, better — approach to 
networking. Here are a few of the main benefits of moving to cloud-based 
networking:
	
✓	Cost-effective: Cloud-based computing typically is less expensive than 
traditional computing. Consider a typical file server application: To 
implement a file server, first you must purchase a file server computer 
with enough disk space to accommodate your users’ needs, which 
amounts to 1TB of disk storage. You want the most reliable data storage 
possible, so you purchase a server-quality computer and fully redundant 
disk drives. For the sake of this discussion, figure that the total price 
of the server — including its disk drive, the operating system license, 
and the labor cost of setting it up — is about $10,000. Assuming that the 
server will last for four years, that totals about $2,500 per year.
	
	If you instead acquire your disk storage from a cloud-based file sharing 
service, you can expect to pay about one fourth of that amount for an 
equivalent amount of storage.

249
 Chapter 15: Life in Cloud City
	
	The same economies apply to most other cloud-based solutions. Cloud-
based e-mail solutions, for example, typically cost around $5 per month 
per user — well less than the cost of setting up and maintaining a 
Microsoft Exchange Server.
	
✓	Scalable: So what happens if you guess wrong about the storage require­
ments of your file server, and your users end up needing 2TB instead 
of just 1TB? With a traditional file server, you must purchase additional 
disk drives to accommodate the extra space. Sooner than you want, 
you’ll run out of capacity in the server’s cabinet. Then you’ll have to 
purchase an external storage cabinet. Eventually, you’ll fill that up, too.
	
	Now suppose that after you expand your server capacity to 2TB, your 
users’ needs contract to just 1TB. Unfortunately, you can’t return disk 
drives for a refund.
	
	With cloud computing, you pay only for the capacity you’re actually 
using, and you can add capacity whenever you need it. In the file server 
example, you can write as much data as you need to the cloud storage. 
Each month, you’re billed according to your actual usage. Thus, you 
don’t have to purchase and install additional disk drives to add storage 
capacity.
	
✓	Reliable: Especially for smaller businesses, cloud services are much 
more reliable than in-house services. Just a week before I wrote this 
chapter, the tape drive that a friend uses to back up his company’s data 
failed. As a result, he was unable to back up data for three days while 
the tape drive was repaired. Had he been using cloud-based backup, he 
could have restored his data immediately and wouldn’t have been with­
out backups for those four days.
	
	The reason for the increased reliability of cloud services is simply a 
matter of scale. Most small businesses can’t afford the redundancies 
needed to make their computer operations as reliable as possible. My 
friend’s company can’t afford to buy two tape drives so that an extra is 
available in case the main one fails.
	
	By contrast, cloud services are usually provided by large companies 
such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM. These companies have 
state-of-the-art data centers with multiple redundancies for their cloud 
services. Cloud storage may be kept on multiple servers so that if one 
server fails, others can take over the load. In some cases, these servers 
are in different data centers in different parts of the country. Thus, your 
data will still be available even in the event of a disaster that shuts down 
an entire data system.
	
✓	Hassle-free: Face it, IT can be a hassle. With cloud-based services, you 
basically outsource the job of complex system maintenance chores, 
such as software upgrade, patches, hardware maintenance, backup, and 

250
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
so on. You get to consume the services while someone else takes care of 
making sure that the services run properly.
	
✓	Globally accessible: One of the best things about cloud services is that 
they’re available anywhere you have an Internet connection. Suppose 
that you have offices in five cities. Using traditional computing, each 
office would require its own servers, and you’d have to carefully design 
systems that allowed users in each of the offices to access shared data.
	
	With cloud computing, each office simply connects to the Internet to 
access the cloud applications. Cloud-based applications are also great 
if your users are mobile because they can access the applications any­
where they can find an Internet connection.
Detailing the Drawbacks 
of Cloud Computing
Although cloud computing has many advantages over traditional techniques, 
it isn’t without its drawbacks. Here are some of the most significant roadblocks 
to adopting cloud computing:
	
✓	Entrenched applications: Your organization may depend on entrenched 
applications that don’t lend themselves especially well to cloud comput­
ing — or that at least require significant conversion efforts to migrate to 
the cloud. For example, you might have use an accounting system that 
relies on local file storage.
	
	Fortunately, many cloud providers offer assistance with this migration. 
And in many cases, the same application that you run locally can be run 
in the cloud, so no conversion is necessary.
	
✓	Internet connection speed: Cloud computing shifts much of the burden 
of your network to your Internet connection. Your users used to access 
their data on local file servers over gigabit-speed connections; now they 
must access data over slower bandwidth Internet connections.
	
	Although you can upgrade your connection to higher speeds, doing so 
will cost money — money that may offset the money you otherwise save 
from migrating to the cloud.
	
✓	Internet connection reliability: The cloud resources you access may 
feature all the redundancy in the world, but if your users access the 
cloud through a single Internet connection, that connection becomes a 
key point of vulnerability. Should it fail, any applications that depend on 
the cloud will be unavailable. If those applications are mission-critical, 
business will come to a halt until the connection is restored.

251
 Chapter 15: Life in Cloud City
	
	Here are two ways to mitigate this risk:
 
• Make sure that you’re using an enterprise-class Internet connection. 
Enterprise-class connections are more expensive but provide 
much better fault tolerance and repair service than consumer-class 
connections do.
 
• Provide redundant connections if you can. That way, if one connec­
tion fails, traffic can be rerouted through alternative connections.
	
✓	Security threats: You can bet your life that hackers throughout the 
world are continually probing for ways to break through the security 
perimeter of all the major cloud providers. When they do, your data may 
be exposed.
	
	The best way to mitigate this threat is to ensure that strong password 
policies are enforced.
Examining Three Basic Kinds 
of Cloud Services
Three distinct kinds of services can be provided via the cloud: applications, 
platforms, and services (infrastructure). The following paragraphs describe 
these three types of cloud services in greater detail.
Applications
Most often referred to as Software as a Service (SaaS), fully functional appli­
cations can be delivered via the cloud. One of the best-known examples is 
Google Apps, which is a suite of cloud-based office applications designed to 
compete directly with Microsoft’s traditional office applications, including 
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and Outlook. Google Apps can also replace 
the back-end software often used to support Microsoft Office, including 
Exchange and SharePoint.
When you use a cloud-based application, you don’t have to worry about 
any of the details that are commonly associated with running an application 
on your network, such as deploying the application and applying product 
upgrades and software patches. Cloud-based applications usually charge a 
small monthly fee based on the number of users running the software, so 
costs are low.

252
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
Also, as a cloud-based application user, you don’t have to worry about pro­
viding the hardware or operating system platform on which the application 
will run. The application provider takes care of that detail for you, so you can 
focus simply on developing the application to best serve your users’ needs.
Platforms
Also referred to as Platform as a Service (PaaS), this class of service refers 
to providers that give you access to a remote virtual operating platform on 
which you can build your own applications.
At the simplest level, a PaaS provider gives you a complete, functional remote 
virtual machine that’s fully configured and ready for you to deploy your 
applications to. If you use a web provider to host your company’s website, 
you’re already using PaaS: Most web host providers give you a functioning 
Linux system, fully configured with all the necessary servers, such as Apache 
or MySQL. All you have to do is build and deploy your web application on the 
provider’s server.
More-complex PaaS solutions include specialized software that your custom 
applications can tap to provide services such as data storage, online order 
processing, and credit card payments. One of the best-known examples of 
this type of PaaS provider is Amazon.
	
When you use PaaS, you take on the responsibility of developing your own 
custom applications to run on the remote platform. The PaaS provider takes 
care of the details of maintaining the platform itself, including the base operat­
ing system and the hardware on which the platform runs.
Infrastructure
If you don’t want to delegate the responsibility of maintaining operating 
systems and other elements of the platform, you can use Infrastructure as a 
Service (IaaS). When you use IaaS, you’re purchasing raw computing power 
that’s accessible via the cloud. Typically, IaaS provides you access to a 
remote virtual machine. It’s up to you to manage and configure the remote 
machine however you want.

253
 Chapter 15: Life in Cloud City
Public Clouds versus Private Clouds
The most common form of cloud computing uses what is known as a public 
cloud — that is, cloud services that are available to anyone in the world via 
the Internet. Google Apps is an excellent example of a public cloud service. 
Anyone with access to the Internet can access the public cloud services of 
Google Apps: Just point your browser to http://apps.google.com.
A public cloud is like a public utility, in that anyone can subscribe to it on a 
pay-as-you-go basis. One of the drawbacks of public cloud services is that 
they’re inherently insecure. When you use a public cloud service, you’re 
entrusting your valuable data to a third party that you cannot control. Sure, 
you can protect your access to your public cloud services by using strong 
passwords, but if your account names and passwords are compromised, 
your public cloud services can be hacked into, and your data can be stolen. 
Every so often, we all hear news stories about how this company’s or that 
company’s back-door security has been compromised.
Besides security, another drawback of public cloud computing is that it’s 
dependent on high-speed, reliable Internet connections. Your cloud service 
provider may have all the redundancy in the world, but if your connection to 
the Internet goes down, you won’t be able to access your cloud services. And 
if your connection is slow, your cloud services will be slow.
A private cloud mimics many of the features of cloud computing but is imple­
mented on a private hardware within a local network, so it isn’t accessible 
to the general public. Private clouds are inherently more secure because the 
general public can’t access them. Also, they’re dependent only on private 
network connections, so they aren’t subject to the limits of a public Internet 
connection.
	
As a rule, private clouds are implemented by large organizations that have the 
resources available to create and maintain their own cloud servers.
A relative newcomer to the cloud computing scene is the hybrid cloud, which 
combines the features of public and private clouds. Typically, a hybrid cloud 
system uses a small private cloud that provides local access to the some of 
the applications and the public cloud for others. You might maintain your 
most frequently used data on a private cloud for fast access via the local 
network and use the public cloud to store archives and other less frequently 
used data, for which performance isn’t as much of an issue.

254
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
Introducing Some of the 
Major Cloud Providers
Hundreds, if not thousands, of companies provide cloud services. Most of the 
cloud computing done today, however, is provided by just a few providers, 
which are described in the following sections.
Amazon
By far the largest provider of cloud services in the world is Amazon. Amazon 
launched its cloud platform — Amazon Web Services (AWS) — in 2006. Since 
then, hundreds of thousands of customers have signed up. Some of the most 
notable users of AWS include Netflix, Pinterest, and Instagram.
AWS includes the following features:
	
✓	Amazon CloudFront: A PaaS content-delivery system designed to deliver 
web content to large numbers of users.
	
✓	Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud: Also called Amazon EC2. An IaaS system 
that provides access to raw computing power.
	
✓	Amazon Simple Storage Service: Also called Amazon S3. Provides 
web-based data storage for unlimited amounts of data.
	
✓	Amazon Simple Queue Service: Also called Amazon SQS. Provides a data 
transfer system that lets applications send messages to other applica­
tions. SQS enables you to build applications that work together.
	
✓	Amazon Virtual Private Cloud: Also called Amazon VPC. Uses virtual 
private network (VPN) connections to connect your local network to 
Amazon’s cloud services.
Google
Google is also one of the largest providers of cloud services. Its offerings 
include the following:
	
✓	Google Apps: A replacement for Microsoft Office that provides basic 
e-mail, word processing, spreadsheet, and database functions via the 
cloud. Google Apps is free to the general public and can even be used 
free by small business (up to 50 users). For larger businesses, Google 

255
 Chapter 15: Life in Cloud City
offers an advanced version, Google Apps for Business. For $5 per month 
per user, you get extra features, such as 25GB of e-mail data per user, 
archiving, and advanced options for customizing your account policies.
	
✓	Google Cloud Connect: A cloud-based solution that lets you work with 
Google cloud data directly from within Microsoft Office applications.
	
✓	Google App Engine: A PaaS interface that lets you develop your own 
applications that work with Google’s cloud services.
	
✓	Google Cloud Print: Allows you to connect your printers to the cloud so 
that they can be accessed from anywhere.
	
✓	Google Maps: A Global Information System (GIS).
Microsoft
Microsoft has its own cloud strategy, designed in part to protect its core 
business of operating systems and Office applications against competition 
from other cloud providers, such as Google Apps.
The following paragraphs summarize several of Microsoft’s cloud offerings:
	
✓	Microsoft Office 365: A cloud-based version of Microsoft Office. According 
to Microsoft’s website, Office 365 provides “anywhere access to cloud-
based email, web conferencing, file sharing, and Office Web Apps at a 
low predictable monthly cost.” For more information, check out www.
office365.com.
	
✓	Windows Azure: A PaaS offering that lets you build websites, deploy 
virtual machines that run Windows Server or Linux, or access cloud 
versions of server applications such as SQL Server.
	
✓	Microsoft Business Productivity Suite: A SaaS product that provides 
cloud-based access to two of Microsoft’s most popular productivity 
servers: Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SharePoint. The suite lets 
you deploy these servers without having to create and maintain your 
own local servers.
Getting Into the Cloud
After you wrap your head around just how cool cloud computing can be, 
what should you do to take your network toward the cloud? Allow me to 
make a few recommendations:

256
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
	
✓	Don’t depend on a poor Internet connection. First and foremost, before 
you take any of your network operations to the cloud, make sure that 
you’re not dependent on a consumer-grade Internet connection if you 
decide to adopt cloud computing. Consumer-grade Internet connections 
can be fast, but when an outage occurs, there’s no telling how long you’ll 
wait for the connection to be repaired. You definitely don’t want to wait 
for hours or days while the cable company thinks about sending someone 
out to your site. Instead, spend the money for a high-speed enterprise-
class connection that can scale as your dependence on it increases.
	
✓	Assess what applications you may already have running on the cloud. 
If you use Gmail rather than Exchange for your e-mail, congratulations! 
You’re already a cloud user. Other examples of cloud services that you 
may already be using include a remote web or FTP host, Dropbox or 
another file sharing service, Carbonite or another online backup service, 
a payroll service, and so on.
	
✓	Don’t move to the cloud all at once. Start by identifying a single appli­
cation that lends itself to the cloud. If your engineering firm archives 
projects when they close and wants to get them off your primary file 
server but keep them readily available, look to the cloud for a file storage 
service.
 	
✓	Go with a reputable company. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are all huge 
companies with proven track records in cloud computing. Many other 
large and established companies also offer cloud services. Don’t stake 
your company’s future on a company that didn’t exist six months ago.
	
✓	Research, research, research. Pour yourself into the web, and buy a few 
books. Cloud Computing For Dummies, by Judith Hurwitz, Robin Bloor, 
Marcia Kaufman, and Fern Halper (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), is a good 
place to start.

Managing Mobile Devices
In This Chapter
▶	Looking at mobile devices
▶	Configuring Windows Mobile devices for Exchange access
▶	Examining BlackBerry and BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES)
▶	Considering security implications
A

 computer consultant once purchased a used BlackBerry device on eBay 
for $15.50. When he put in a new battery and turned on the device, he 
discovered that it contained confidential e-mails and personal contact informa­
tion for executives of a well-known financial institution.
Oops!
It turns out that a former executive with the company sold his old BlackBerry 
on eBay a few months after he left the firm. He’d assumed that because he’d 
removed the battery, everything on the BlackBerry had been erased.
The point of this true story is that mobile devices such as smartphones and 
tablet computers pose a special set of challenges for network administrators. 
These challenges are now being faced even by administrators of small net­
works. Just a few years ago, only large companies had BlackBerry or other 
mobile devices that integrated with Exchange e-mail, for example. Now it isn’t 
uncommon for companies with just a few employees to have mobile devices 
connected to the company network.
This chapter is a brief introduction to mobile devices and the operating systems 
they run, with an emphasis on iPhone and Android devices. You find out 
more about how these devices can interact with Exchange e-mail and the 
steps you can take to ensure their security.

The Many Types of Mobile Devices
Once upon a time, there were mobile phones and PDAs. A mobile phone was 
just that: a handheld telephone you could take with you. The good ones had 
nice features such as a call log, an address book, and perhaps a crude game, 
but not much else. PDAs — Personal Digital Assistants — were little handheld 
computers designed to replace the old-fashioned Day-Timer books people 
used to carry around with them to keep track of their appointment calendars 
and address books.
All that changed when cellular providers began adding data capabilities to 
their networks. Now cellphones can have complete mobile Internet access. 
This fact has resulted in the addition of sophisticated PDA features to mobile 
phones and phone features to PDAs so that the distinctions are blurred.
A mobile device can be any one of a wide assortment of devices that you can 
hold in one hand and that are connected through a wireless network. The 
term handheld is a similar generic name for such devices. The following list 
describes some of the most common specifics of mobile devices:
	
✓	Mobile phone: Primary purpose is to enable phone service. Most mobile 
phones also include text messaging, address books, appointment calen­
dars, and games; they may also provide Internet access.
	
✓	Smartphone: A mobile phone with advanced features not typically found 
on mobile phones. There’s no clearly drawn line between mobile phones 
and smartphones. One distinction is whether the phone can provide 
integrated access to corporate e-mail. The screen on a smartphone is 
typically bigger than the screen on a traditional cellphone, and most 
models (such as the iPhone and most Android devices) don’t have hard 
keyboards.
	
✓	BlackBerry: BlackBerry devices are sophisticated PDAs that have cell­
phone capabilities. The most distinctive feature of BlackBerry devices is 
their capability to synchronize with Exchange e-mail servers to provide 
instant access to your corporate e-mail. Typically, this synchronization 
requires a special server — BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) — running 
on the corporate network. BlackBerry devices use a proprietary operating 
system (OS) developed by RIM.
	
✓	iPhone and iPad: Apple’s iPhone has taken the smartphone market 
by storm. Although there are still more BlackBerry devices in use 
than iPhones, iPhone is gaining market share and may soon overtake 
BlackBerry. Unlike a BlackBerry, an iPhone doesn’t require a separate 
server to enable full Exchange mailbox synchronization.
	
✓	Android: Android is an open source OS for smartphones, developed by 
Google. Android is designed in many ways to mimic the features of the 
iPhone, so experienced iPhone users will find Android phones to be very 
similar. At the time I wrote this chapter, the overwhelming majority of 
new smartphones being sold were Android devices.

 Chapter 16: Managing Mobile Devices
Considering Security for Mobile Devices
As a network administrator, one of your main responsibilities regarding 
mobile devices is to keep them secure. Unfortunately, that’s a significant 
challenge. Here are some reasons why:
	
✓	Mobile devices connect to your network via other networks that are out 
of your control. You can go to great lengths to set up firewalls, encryp­
tion, and a host of other security features, but mobile devices connect 
via public networks whose administrators may not be as conscientious 
as you.
	
✓	Mobile devices are easy to lose. A user might leave her smartphone at a 
restaurant or hotel, or it might fall out of her pocket on the subway.
	
✓	Mobile devices run OSes that aren’t as security conscious as Windows.
	
✓	Users who wouldn’t dare install renegade software on their desktop 
computers think nothing of downloading free games or other applica­
tions to their handheld devices. Who knows what kinds of viruses or 
Trojans these downloads carry?
	
✓	Inevitably, someone will buy his own handheld device and connect it 
to your network without your knowledge or permission.
Here are some recommendations for beefing up security for your mobile 
devices:
	
✓	Establish clear, consistent policies for mobile devices, and enforce them.
	
✓	Make sure employees understand that they aren’t allowed to bring their 
own devices into your network. Allow only company-owned devices to 
connect.
	
✓	Train your users in the security risks associated with using mobile devices.
	
✓	Implement antivirus protection for your mobile devices.
Managing iOS Devices
In 2007, the Apple iPhone, one of the most innovative little gadgets in many, 
many years, hit the technology market. As a result, in just a few short years, 
the iPhone captured a huge slice of a market dominated almost exclusively 
by RIM and its BlackBerry devices. Since then, the iPhone’s share of the 
mobile-phone market has grown beyond that of the former king, BlackBerry.
The success of the iPhone was due in large part to the genius of its OS: iOS. 
In 2010, Apple released the iPad, a tablet computer that runs the same iOS as 
the iPhone. And in 2012, Apple introduced a smaller version of the iPad: the 
iPad mini. Together, these devices are commonly known as iOS devices.

260
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
Understanding the iPhone
The iPhone is essentially a combination of four devices:
	
✓	A cellphone
	
✓	An iPod with a memory capacity of 8GB to 64GB
	
✓	A digital camera
	
✓	An Internet device with its own web browser (Safari) and applications, 
such as e-mail, calendar, and contact management
The most immediately noticeable feature of the iPhone is its lack of a 
keyboard. Instead, nearly the entire front surface of the iPhone is a high-
resolution, touch-sensitive LCD display. The display is not only the main 
output device of the iPhone, but also its main input device. The display can 
become a keypad input for dialing a telephone number or a keyboard for 
entering text. You can also use various finger gestures, such as tapping icons 
to start programs or pinching to zoom in the display.
The iPhone has several other innovative features:
	
✓	An accelerometer tracks the motion of the iPhone in three directions. The 
main use of the accelerometer is to adjust the orientation of the display 
from landscape to portrait based on how the user is holding the phone. 
Some other applications — mostly games — use the accelerometer as well.
	
✓	A Wi-Fi interface lets the iPhone connect to local Wi-Fi networks for 
faster Internet access.
	
✓	GPS capability provides location awareness for many applications, 
including Google Maps.
	
✓	The virtual private network (VPN) client lets you connect to your internal 
network.
Of all the unique features of the iPhone, probably the most important is its huge 
collection of third-party applications that can be downloaded from a special 
web portal, the App Store. Many of these applications are free or cost just a 
few dollars. (Many are just 99 cents or $1.99.) As of this writing, more than 
500,000 applications — everything from business productivity to games — 
were available from the App Store.
Understanding the iPad
The iPad is essentially an iPhone without the phone but with a larger screen. 
The iPhone comes with a 3.5" screen; the iPad has a 9.7" screen; and its 
smaller cousin, the iPad mini, has a 7.9" screen.

261
 Chapter 16: Managing Mobile Devices
Apart from these basic differences, an iPad is nearly identical to an iPhone. 
Any application that can run on an iPhone can also run on an iPad, and 
many applications are designed to take special advantage of the iPad’s larger 
screen.
All the information that follows in this chapter applies equally to iPhones and 
iPads.
Integrating iOS Devices with Exchange
An iOS device can integrate with Microsoft Exchange e-mail. You must follow 
three procedures to make that integration possible:
	
1.	 Enable the Mobile Services feature of Microsoft Exchange.
	
2.	 Enable ActiveSync for the user’s mailbox.
	
3.	 Configure the iPhone to connect to the user’s Exchange mailbox.
The following sections describe these procedures.
Enabling Exchange Mobile Services
To enable an Exchange mailbox for an iOS device, you must enable the 
Exchange Mobile Services feature on the Exchange server. You must com­
plete this procedure just once for each Exchange server. Here are the steps:
	
1.	Log on to the Exchange server with an Exchange Administrator 
account.
	
2.	Choose Start➪Administrative Tools➪Exchange System Manager.
	
3.	In the navigation pane of Exchange System Manager, expand the 
Global Settings node.
	
4.	Right-click Mobile Services and then choose Properties from the 
contextual menu.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 16-1 appears.
	
5.	Select all the check boxes on the General tab.
	
	This step enables all the capabilities of Outlook Mobile Access.

262

Enabling 
Outlook 
Mobile 
Access.
	
	
6.	Click OK.
	
7.	Close Exchange System Manager.
	
	You’re done!
Enabling ActiveSync for a user’s mailbox
After you enable Exchange Mobile Services for your Exchange server, you 
can enable ActiveSync for the user’s Exchange mailbox. Enabling ActiveSync 
allows the mailbox to be synchronized with a remote mail client such as an 
iPhone. Here are the steps:
	
1.	Choose Start➪Administrative Tools➪Active Directory Users and 
Computers.
	
	The Active Directory Users and Computers console opens.
	
2.	Expand the domain and then locate the user you want to enable 
mobile access for.
	
3.	Right-click the user and then choose Properties from the contextual 
menu.
	
4.	Click the Exchange Features tab.
	
	The Exchange Features options are displayed, as shown in Figure 16-2.

263
 Chapter 16: Managing Mobile Devices
	
Figure 16-2: 
Enabling 
mobile 
access for a 
user.
	
	
5.	Enable all three options listed under Mobile Services.
	
	If the options aren’t already enabled, right-click each option and choose 
Enable from the contextual menu.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
7.	Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for any other users you want to enable mobile 
access for.
	
8.	Close Active Directory Users and Computers.
That’s all there is to it. After you enable these features, any users running 
Windows Mobile can synchronize their handheld devices with their Exchange 
mailboxes.
Configuring an iOS device 
for Exchange e-mail
After ActiveSync is enabled for the mailbox, you can configure an iPhone or 
iPad to tap into the Exchange account by following these steps:

264

in the Server field.
	
	For example, if your Exchange server uses the name mail.mydomain.
com, enter that in the Server field.
	
7.	Tap Next.
	
	The screen shown in Figure 16-7 appears. Here, you select which mail­
box features you want to synchronize: Mail, Contacts, or Calendars.

After the e-mail account has been configured, the user can access it via the 
Mail icon on the iPhone’s home screen.
Managing Android Devices
For the better part of a year, Apple had the touchscreen smartphone market 
all to itself. But in late 2008, T-Mobile released a touchscreen smartphone 
called the Dream, made by HTC. This smartphone was the first of many 
phones based on the Android OS developed by Google. Android-based phones 
are similar to iPhones in many ways, but they also have many differences. The 
most important difference is that the Android OS is available on many phones, 
whereas the iOS operating system is proprietary to Apple and available only 
on Apple devices.

268
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
This section is a brief introduction to the Android platform. You find out a bit 
about what Android actually is, and you discover the procedures for setting 
up Exchange e-mail access on an Android phone.
In many ways, Android phones are similar to iPhones. Like iPhones, Android 
phones feature a touchscreen display, have built-in MP3 music players, and 
provide access to a large library of downloadable third-party applications. In 
essence, Android phones are competitors with iPhones.
Crucial differences exist between Android phones and iPhones, however. The 
most important difference — in many ways, the only important difference — 
is that Android phones are based on an open source OS derived from Linux, 
which can be extended and adapted to work on a wide variety of hardware 
devices from different vendors. With the iPhone, you’re locked into Apple 
hardware. With an Android phone, though, you can buy hardware from a 
variety of manufacturers.
Looking at the Android OS
Most people associate the Android OS with Google, and it’s true that Google 
is the driving force behind Android. The Android OS is an open source OS 
managed by the Open Handset Alliance (OHA). Google still plays a major role 
in the development of Android, but more than 50 companies are involved 
in the OHA, including hardware manufacturers (such as HTC, Intel, and 
Motorola), software companies (such as Google and eBay), and mobile-phone 
operators (such as T-Mobile and Sprint-Nextel).
	
Technically speaking, Android is more than just an OS. It’s also a complete 
software stack, which comprises several key components that work together 
to create the complete Android platform:
	
✓	The OS core, which is based on the popular Linux OS
	
✓	A middleware layer, which provides drivers and other support code to 
enable the OS core to work with the hardware devices that make up a 
complete phone, such as a touch-sensitive display, the cellphone radio, 
the speaker and microphone, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi networking components, 
and so on
	
✓	A set of core applications that the user interacts with to make phone 
calls, read e-mail, send text messages, take pictures, and so on
	
✓	A Software Developers Kit (SDK) that lets third-party software develop­
ers create their own applications to run on an Android phone, as well as 
a marketplace where the applications can be marketed and sold, much 
as the App Store lets iPhone developers market and sell applications for 
the iPhone

269
 Chapter 16: Managing Mobile Devices
Besides the basic features provided by all OSes, here are a few bonus fea­
tures of the Android software stack:
	
✓	An optimized graphical display engine that can produce sophisticated 
2-D and 3-D graphics
	
✓	GPS capabilities that provide location awareness that can be integrated 
with applications such as Google Maps
	
✓	Compass and accelerometer capabilities that can determine whether the 
phone is in motion and in which direction it’s pointed
	
✓	A built-in SQL database server for data storage
	
✓	Support for several network technologies, including 3G, 4G, Bluetooth, 
and Wi-Fi
	
✓	Built-in media support, including common formats for still images, 
audio, and video files
Perusing Android’s core applications
The Android OS comes preconfigured with several standard applications, 
which provide the functionality that most people demand from a modern 
smartphone. These applications include
	
✓	Dialer: Provides the basic cellphone function that lets users make calls.
	
✓	Browser: A built-in web browser that’s similar to Google’s Chrome browser.
	
✓	Messaging: Provides text (SMS) and multimedia (MMS) messaging.
	
✓	Email: A basic e-mail client that works best with Google’s Gmail but that 
can be configured to work with other e-mail servers, including Exchange.
	
✓	Contacts: Provides a contacts list that integrates with the Dialer and 
Email applications.
	
✓	Camera: Lets you use the phone’s camera hardware (if any) to take 
pictures.
	
✓	Calculator: A simple calculator application.
	
✓	Alarm Clock: A basic alarm clock. You can set up to three different alarms.
	
✓	Maps: An integrated version of Google Maps.
	
✓	YouTube: An integrated version of YouTube.
	
✓	Music: An MP3 player similar to the iPod. You can purchase and down­
load music files from Amazon.
	
✓	Google Play: Lets you purchase and download third-party applications 
for the Android phone.
	
✓	Settings: Lets you control various settings for the phone.

Integrating Android with Exchange
The Android’s core Email application can integrate with Microsoft Exchange 
e-mail. To do that, you must enable Exchange Mobile Services and then enable 
ActiveSync for the user’s mailbox. For more information, see the sections 
“Enabling Exchange Mobile Services” and “Enabling ActiveSync for a user’s 
mailbox,” earlier in this chapter.
After you enable Exchange Mobile Services and ActiveSync on your Exchange 
server, you can easily configure the Android phone for e-mail access. Just 
run the Email application on the Android phone, and follow the configuration 
steps, which ask you for basic information such as your e-mail address, user­
name, password, and Exchange mail server.

Chapter 17
Connecting from Home
In This Chapter
▶	Accessing your e-mail with Outlook Web Access
▶	Using a virtual private network
A

 typical computer user takes work home to work on in the evening or 
over the weekend and bring back to the office the following weekday. 
This arrangement can work okay, except that exchanging information between 
your home computer and your office computer isn’t easy.
One way to exchange files is to mark them for offline access, as I describe in 
Chapter 3. However, this approach has its drawbacks. What if someone goes 
to the office on Saturday and modifies the same file you’re working on at home? 
What if you get home and discover that the file you need is on a folder you 
didn’t mark for offline access?
What about e-mail? Offline access doesn’t give you access to your company 
e-mail account, so you can’t check whether you have mail in your Inbox or 
send mail from your company e-mail account.
This chapter introduces two features that can alleviate these problems. The 
first is Internet-based access to your e-mail via Outlook Web App (OWA) in 
Microsoft Exchange. The second is the virtual private network (VPN), which 
lets you connect to your network from home as though you were at work so 
that you can safely access all your network resources as though you were 
locally connected to the network.
Using Outlook Web App
Most people who connect to their office networks from home really just need 
their e-mail. If the only reason for accessing the office network is to get e-mail, 
try this simple, easy tool: Outlook Web App, also known as OWA. This Microsoft 
Exchange Server feature can access your company e-mail from any computer 
that has an Internet connection. The remote computer just needs a web browser 
and an Internet connection; no VPN or other special configuration is required.

272
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
The best part is that you don’t have to do anything special to enable OWA; 
it’s enabled by default when you install Microsoft Exchange. Although you 
can configure plenty of options to improve its use, OWA is functional right 
out of the box.
To access OWA from any web browser, just browse to the address designated 
for your organization’s OWA. The default address is the DNS name of your mail 
server, followed by /exchange. For example, for the mail server smtp.low
ewriter.com, the OWA address is smtp.lowewriter.com/exchange.
	
The connection must use the secure version of the normal HTTP web protocol. 
You must type https:// before the OWA address. The complete address will be 
something like https://smtp.lowewriter.com/exchange.
When you browse to your OWA address, you’re prompted to enter a name 
and password. Use your regular network logon name and password. OWA 
appears in the browser window, as shown in Figure 17-1.
	
Figure 17-1: 
OWA looks 
a lot like 
Outlook.
	

273
 Chapter 17: Connecting from Home
If you’re familiar with Outlook, you’ll have no trouble using OWA. Almost 
all Outlook features are available, including your inbox, calendar, contacts, 
tasks, reminders, and even public folders. You can even set up an Out of 
Office reply.
One difference between OWA and Outlook is that there’s no menu bar across 
the top. However, most of the functions that are available from the menu bar 
are available elsewhere in OWA. If you can’t find a feature, look in the Options 
page, which you can reach by clicking Options at the bottom left of the window. 
Figure 17-2 shows the Options page. From here, you can create an Out of Office 
reply, set your signature, and change a variety of other options.
	
Figure 17-2: 
Set OWA 
options 
here.
	
Using a Virtual Private Network
A virtual private network (VPN) is a type of network connection that creates 
the illusion that you’re directly connected to a network when in fact, you’re 
not. For example, suppose you set up a LAN at your office, but you also 

274
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
occasionally work from home. But how will you access the files on your work 
computer from home?
	
✓	You could simply copy whatever files you need from your work computer 
onto a flash drive and take them home with you, work on the files, copy 
the updated files back to the flash drive, and take them back to work 
with you the next day.
	
✓	You could e-mail the files to your personal e-mail account, work on them 
at home, and then e-mail the changed files back to your work e-mail 
account.
	
✓	You could get a laptop and use the Windows Offline Files feature to 
automatically synchronize files from your work network with files on 
the laptop.
Or you could set up a VPN that allows you to log on to your work network 
from home. The VPN uses a secured Internet connection to connect you 
directly to your work network, so you can access your network files as if you 
had a really long Ethernet cable that ran from your home computer all the 
way to the office and plugged directly into the work network.
Here are at least three situations in which a VPN is the ideal solution:
	
✓	Workers need to occasionally work from home (as in the scenario just 
described). In this situation, a VPN connection establishes a connection 
between the home computer and the office network.
	
✓	Mobile users — who may not ever actually show up at the office — need 
to connect to the work network from mobile computers, often from loca­
tions like hotel rooms, clients’ offices, airports, or coffee shops. This 
type of VPN configuration is similar to the home user’s configuration 
except that the exact location of the remote user’s computer is not fixed.
	
✓	Your company has offices in two or more locations, each with its own 
LAN, and you want to connect the locations so that users on either net­
work can access each other’s network resources. In this situation, the 
VPN doesn’t connect a single user with a remote network; instead, it 
connects two remote networks to each other.
Looking at VPN security
The V in VPN stands for virtual, which means that a VPN creates the appear­
ance of a local network connection when in fact the connection is made 
over a public network — the Internet. The term tunnel is sometimes used 
to describe a VPN because the VPN creates a tunnel between two locations, 

275
 Chapter 17: Connecting from Home
which can be entered only from either end. The data that travels through the 
tunnel from one end to the other is secure as long as it’s within the tunnel — 
that is, within the protection provided by the VPN.
The P in VPN stands for private, which is the purpose of creating the tunnel. If 
the VPN didn’t create effective security so that data can enter the tunnel only 
at one of the two ends, the VPN would be worthless; you may as well just 
open your network and your remote computer up to the Internet and let the 
hackers have their way.
Prior to VPN technology, the only way to provide private remote network 
connections was through actual private lines, which were (and still are) very 
expensive. For example, to set up a remote office, you could lease a private 
T1 line from the phone company to connect the two offices. This private T1 
line provided excellent security because it physically connected the two 
offices and could be accessed only from the two endpoints.
VPN provides the same point-to-point connection as a private leased line, but 
does it over the Internet instead of through expensive dedicated lines. To 
create the tunnel that guarantees privacy of the data as it travels from one 
end of the VPN to the other, the data is encrypted using special security 
protocols.
The most important of the VPN security protocols is Internet Protocol Security 
(IPSec), which is a collection of standards for encrypting and authenticating 
packets that travel on the Internet. In other words, it provides a way to 
encrypt the contents of a data packet so that only a person who knows the 
secret encryption keys can decode the data. And it provides a way to reliably 
identify the source of a packet so that the parties at either end of the VPN 
tunnel can trust that the packets are authentic.
Another commonly used VPN protocol is Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). 
This protocol doesn’t provide data encryption. Instead, it’s designed to 
create end-to-end connections — tunnels — through which data can travel. 
L2TP is actually a combination of two older protocols: Layer 2 Forwarding 
Protocol (L2FP, from Cisco), and Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP, 
from Microsoft).
Many VPNs today use a combination of L2TP and IPSec: L2TP over IPSec. 
This type of VPN combines the best features of L2TP and IPSec to provide a 
high degree of security and reliability.
Understanding VPN servers and clients
A VPN connection requires a VPN server — the gatekeeper at one end of the 
tunnel — and a VPN client at the other end. The main difference between 

276
Part IV: Cloudy with a Chance of Gigabytes 
the server and the client is that the client initiates the connection with the 
server, and a VPN client can establish a connection with just one server at a 
time. However, a server can accept connections from many clients.
Typically, the VPN server is a separate hardware device, most often a security 
appliance such as a Cisco ASA security appliance. VPN servers can also be 
implemented in software. For example, Windows Server includes built-in VPN 
capabilities even though they’re not easy to configure. And a VPN server can 
be implemented in Linux as well.
Figure 17-3 shows one of the many VPN configuration screens for a Cisco ASA 
appliance. This screen provides the configuration details for an IPSec VPN 
connection. The most important item of information on this screen is the 
Pre-Shared Key, which is used to encrypt the data sent over the VPN. The 
client will need to provide the identical key in order to participate in the VPN.
	
Figure 17-3: 
An IPSec 
configuration  
page on a 
Cisco ASA 
security 
appliance.
	
	
A VPN client is usually software that runs on a client computer that wants to 
connect to the remote network. The VPN client software must be configured 
with the IP address of the VPN server as well as authentication information 
such as a username and the Pre-Shared Key that will be used to encrypt the 
data. If the key used by the client doesn’t match the key used by the server, 
the VPN server will reject the connection request from the client.

277
 Chapter 17: Connecting from Home
Figure 17-4 shows a typical VPN software client. When the client is configured 
with the correct connection information (which you can do by clicking the 
New button), you just click Connect. After a few moments, the VPN client will 
announce that the connection has been established and the VPN is connected.
	
Figure 17-4: 
A VPN  
client.
	
A VPN client can also be a hardware device, like another security appliance. 
This is most common when the VPN is used to connect two networks at sepa­
rate locations. For example, suppose your company has an office in Pixley and 
a second office in Hooterville. Each office has its own network with servers 
and client computers. The easiest way to connect these offices with a VPN 
would be to put an identical security appliance at each location. Then you 
could configure the security appliances to communicate with each other 
over a VPN.

Does this sound like an ad that your company should run? Every network 
needs a network administrator, whether the network has 2 computers or 
2,000. Of course, managing a 2,000-computer network is a full-time job, 
whereas managing a 2-computer network isn’t. At least, it shouldn’t be.

Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
What a Network Administrator Does
A network administrator “administers” a network: installing, configuring, 
expanding, protecting, upgrading, tuning, and repairing the network.
A network administrator takes care of the network hardware (such as cables, 
hubs, switches, routers, servers, and clients) and the network software (such 
as network operating systems, e-mail servers, backup software, database 
servers, and application software). Most important, the administrator takes 
care of network users by answering their questions, listening to their troubles, 
and solving their problems.
On a big network, these responsibilities constitute a full-time job. Large 
networks tend to be volatile: Users come and go, equipment fails, software 
chokes, and life in general seems to be one crisis after another.
Smaller networks are much more stable. After you get your network up and 
running, you probably won’t have to spend much time managing its hardware 
and software. An occasional problem may pop up, but with only a few com­
puters on the network, problems should be few and far between.
Regardless of the network’s size, the administrator attends to common chores:
	
✓	Get involved in every decision to purchase new computers, printers, 
or other equipment.
	
✓	Put on the pocket protector whenever a new computer is added to the 
network. The network administrator’s job includes considering changes 
in the cabling configuration, assigning a computer name to the new com­
puter, integrating the new user into the security system, and granting 
user rights.
	
✓	Whenever a software vendor releases a new version of its software, 
read about the new version and decide whether its new features war­
rant an upgrade. In most cases, the hardest part of upgrading to new 
software is determining the migration path — that is, upgrading your 
entire network to the new version while disrupting the network and its 
users as little as possible. This statement is especially true if the soft­
ware in question happens to be your network operating system because 
any change to the network operating system can potentially impact the 
entire network.
	
	Between upgrades, software vendors periodically release patches 
and service packs that fix minor problems. For more information, see 
Chapter 22.

283
 Chapter 18: Welcome to Network Management
	
✓	Perform routine chores, such as backing up the servers, archiving old 
data, and freeing up server disk space. Much of the task of network 
administration involves making sure that things keep working by finding 
and correcting problems before users notice that something is wrong. In 
this sense, network administration can be a thankless job.
	
✓	Gather, organize, and track the entire network’s software inventory. You 
never know when something will go haywire on the ancient Windows 95 
computer that Joe in Marketing uses, and you have to reinstall that old 
copy of Lotus Approach. Do you have any idea where the installation 
disks are?
Choosing the Part-Time Administrator
The larger the network, the more technical support it needs. Most small net­
works — with just a dozen or so computers — can get by with a part-time 
network administrator. Ideally, this person should be a closet computer geek: 
someone who has a secret interest in computers but doesn’t like to admit it. 
Someone who will take books home with him or her and read them over the 
weekend. Someone who enjoys solving computer problems just for the sake 
of solving them.
The job of managing a network requires some computer skills, but it isn’t 
entirely a technical job. Much of the work that the network administrator does 
is routine housework. Basically, the network administrator dusts, vacuums, 
and mops the network periodically to keep it from becoming a mess.
Here are some additional ideas on picking a part-time network administrator:
	
✓	The network administrator needs to be an organized person. Conduct a 
surprise office inspection and place the person with the neatest desk in 
charge of the network. (Don’t warn them in advance, or everyone may 
mess up their desks intentionally the night before the inspection.)
	
✓	Allow enough time for network administration. For a small network (say, 
no more than 20 or so computers), an hour or two each week is enough. 
More time is needed upfront as the network administrator settles into 
the job and discovers the ins and outs of the network. After an initial 
settling-in period, though, network administration for a small office net­
work doesn’t take more than an hour or two per week. (Of course, larger 
networks take more time to manage.)
	
✓	Make sure that everyone knows who the network administrator is and 
that the network administrator has the authority to make decisions 
about the network, such as what access rights each user has, what files 

284
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
can and can’t be stored on the server, how often backups are done, and 
so on.
	
✓	Pick someone who is assertive and willing to irritate people. A good net­
work administrator should make sure that backups are working before a 
hard drive fails and make sure that antivirus protection is in place before 
a virus wipes out the entire network. This policing will irritate people, 
but it’s for their own good.
	
✓	In most cases, the person who installs the network is also the network 
administrator. This is appropriate because no one understands the net­
work better than the person who designs and installs it.
	
✓	The network administrator needs an understudy — someone who knows 
almost as much about the network, is eager to make a mark, and smiles 
when the worst network jobs are delegated.
	
✓	The network administrator has some sort of official title, such as 
Network Boss, Network Czar, Vice President in Charge of Network 
Operations, or Dr. Network. A badge, a personalized pocket protector, 
or a set of Spock ears helps, too.
The Three “Ups” of Network 
Management
Much of the network manager’s job is routine stuff — the equivalent of vacu­
uming, dusting, and mopping, or changing your car’s oil and rotating the 
tires.
Three of the most important routine tasks that a network administrator must 
do vigilantly are what I call the “Three Ups of Network Management.” They are
	
✓	Back up: The network manager must ensure that the network is properly 
backed up. If something goes wrong and the network isn’t backed up, 
guess who gets the blame? On the other hand, if disaster strikes yet 
you’re able to recover everything from yesterday’s backup with only a 
small amount of work lost, who gets the pat on the back, the fat bonus, 
and the vacation in the Bahamas? Chapter 20 describes the options for 
network backups. Read it soon.
	
✓	Lock-up: Another major task for a network administrator is sheltering 
the network from the evils of the outside world. These evils come in 
many forms, including hackers trying to break into your network and 
virus programs arriving through e-mail. Chapter 21 describes this task in 
more detail.

285
 Chapter 18: Welcome to Network Management
	
✓	Clean-up: Users think that the network server is like the attic: They want 
to throw files up there and leave them forever. No matter how much 
disk storage your network has, your users will fill it up sooner than you 
think, so the network manager gets the fun job of cleaning up the attic 
once in a while. The best advice I can offer is to continually complain 
about how messy it is up there and warn your users that spring cleaning 
is on the to-do list.
Managing Network Users
Managing network technology is the easiest part of network management. 
Computer technology can be confusing at first, but computers aren’t as con­
fusing as people. The real challenge of managing a network is managing the 
network’s users.
The difference between managing technology and managing users is obvious: 
You can figure out computers, but who can ever really figure out people? 
The people who use the network are much less predictable than the network 
itself. Here are some tips for dealing with users:
	
✓	Make user training a key part of the network manager’s job. Make sure 
that everyone who uses the network understands how it works and how 
to use it. If the network users don’t understand how the network works, 
they may unintentionally do all kinds of weird things to it.
	
✓	Treat network users respectfully. If users don’t understand how to use 
the network, it’s not their fault. Explain it to them. Offer a class. Buy 
each one a copy of this book, and tell them to read it during the lunch 
hour. Hold their hands. Just don’t treat them like idiots.
	
✓	Create a network cheat sheet. It should contain everything users need 
to know about using the network — on one page. Everyone needs a copy.
	
✓	Be as responsive as possible. If you don’t quickly fix a network user’s 
problem, he may try to fix it. You don’t want that to happen.
	
The better you understand the psychology of network users, the more prepared 
you are for the strangeness they often serve up. Toward that end, I recommend 
that you read the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (also 
known as DSM-5) from cover to cover.

286
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
Acquiring Software Tools for 
Network Administrators
Network managers need certain tools to get their jobs done. Managers of big, 
complicated, expensive networks need big, complicated, expensive tools. 
Managers of small networks need small tools.
Some tools that a manager needs are hardware tools, such as screwdrivers, 
cable crimpers, and hammers. The tools I’m talking about, however, are soft­
ware tools. I mention a couple of them earlier in this chapter: Visio (to help 
you draw network diagrams) and a network-discovery tool to help you map 
your network. Here are a few others:
	
✓	Built-in TCP/IP commands: Many of the software tools that you need 
in order to manage a network come with the network itself. As the net­
work manager, you should read through the manuals that come with 
your network software to see which management tools are available. For 
example, Windows includes a net diag command that you can use to 
make sure that all the computers on a network can communicate with 
each other. (You can run net diag from an MS-DOS prompt.) For TCP/
IP networks, you can use the TCP/IP diagnostic commands that I summa­
rize in Table 18-1.

✓	System Information: This program, which comes with Windows, is a 
useful utility for network managers.
	
✓	Hotfix Checker: This handy tool from Microsoft scans your computers 
to see which patches need to be applied. You can download the Hotfix 
Checker for free from the Microsoft website. Just go to www.microsoft.
com and search for hotfix.
	
✓	Baseline Security Analyzer: If you prefer GUI-based tools, check out this 
program, which you can download for free from the Microsoft website. 
To find it, go to www.microsoft.com and search for Microsoft Baseline 
Security Analyzer.
	
✓	Protocol analyzer: A protocol analyzer (or packet sniffer) can monitor 
and log the individual packets that travel along your network. You can 
configure the protocol analyzer to filter specific types of packets, watch 
for specific types of problems, and provide statistical analysis of the 
captured packets.
	
	Most network administrators agree that Sniffer, by NetScout Systems, Inc. 
(www.netscout.com) is the best protocol analyzer available. However, 
it’s also one of the most expensive. If you prefer a free alternative, check out 
Wireshark, which you can download for free from www.wireshark.org.
	
✓	Network Monitor: All current versions of Windows include a program 
called Network Monitor, which provides basic protocol analysis and can 
often help solve pesky network problems.
Building a Library
Scotty delivered one of his best lines in the original Star Trek series when he 
refused to take shore leave so that he could get caught up on his technical 
journals. “Don’t you ever relax?” asked Kirk. “I am relaxing!” Scotty replied.
To be a good network administrator, you need to read computer books — lots 
of them. And you need to enjoy doing it. If you’re the type who takes computer 
books with you to the beach, you’ll make a great network administrator.
Read books on a variety of topics. I don’t recommend specific titles, but I do 
recommend that you get a good, comprehensive book on each of these topics:
	
✓	Network security and hacking
	
✓	Wireless networking
	
✓	Network cabling and hardware

288
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
✓	Ethernet
	
✓	Windows Server 2008 or 2012
	
✓	Windows 7 or 8
	
✓	Linux
	
✓	TCP/IP
	
✓	DNS
	
✓	Sendmail or Microsoft Exchange Server, depending on which e-mail 
server you use
In addition to books, you may also want to subscribe to some magazines to 
keep up with what’s happening in the networking industry. Here are a few 
you should probably consider, along with their web addresses:
	
✓	InformationWeek: www.informationweek.com
	
✓	InfoWorld: www.infoworld.com
	
✓	Network Computing: www.networkcomputing.com
	
✓	Network World: www.networkworld.com
	
✓	2600 The Hacker Quarterly (a great magazine on computer hacking and 
security): www.2600.com
	
The Internet is one of the best sources of technical information for network 
administrators. You’ll want to stock your browser’s Favorites menu with 
plenty of websites that contain useful networking information. In addition, you 
may want to subscribe to one of the many online newsletters that deliver fresh 
information on a regular basis via e-mail.
Pursuing Certification
Remember the scene near the end of The Wizard of Oz when the Wizard 
grants the Scarecrow a diploma, the Cowardly Lion a medal, and the Tin Man 
a testimonial?
Network certifications are kind of like that. I can picture the scene now:
The Wizard: “And as for you, my network-burdened friend, any geek with 
thick glasses can administer a network. Back where I come from, there 
are people who do nothing but configure Cisco routers all day long. And 
they don’t have any more brains than you do. But they do have one thing 
you don’t have: certification. And so, by the authority vested in me by the 

289
 Chapter 18: Welcome to Network Management
Universita Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum, I hereby confer upon you 
the coveted certification of CND.”
You: “CND?”
The Wizard: “Yes, that’s, uh, Certified Network Dummy.”
You: “The Seven Layers of the OSI Reference Model are equal to the Sum 
of the Layers on the Opposite Side. Oh, joy, rapture! I feel like a network 
administrator already!”
My point is that certification in and of itself doesn’t guarantee that you really 
know how to administer a network. That ability comes from real-world 
experience — not exam crams.
Nevertheless, certification is becoming increasingly important in today’s 
competitive job market. So you may want to pursue certification, not just 
to improve your skills, but also to improve your resume. Certification is 
an expensive proposition. Each test can cost several hundred dollars, and 
depending on your technical skills, you may need to buy books to study or 
enroll in training courses before you take the tests.
You can pursue two basic types of certification: vendor-specific certifica­
tion and vendor-neutral certification. The major software vendors such as 
Microsoft and Cisco provide certification programs for their own equipment 
and software. CompTIA, a nonprofit industry trade association, provides the 
best-known vendor-neutral certification.
Helpful Bluffs and Excuses
As network administrator, you just won’t be able to solve a problem some­
times, at least not immediately. You can do two things in this situation. The 
first is to explain that the problem is particularly difficult and that you’ll have 
a solution as soon as possible. The second solution is to look the user in the 
eyes and, with a straight face, try one of these phony explanations:
	
✓	Blame it on the version of whatever software you’re using. “Oh, they 
fixed that with version 39.”
	
✓	Blame it on cheap, imported memory chips.
	
✓	Blame it on Democrats. Or Republicans. Doesn’t matter.
	
✓	Blame it on oil company executives.
	
✓	Blame it on global warming.

290
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
✓	Hope that the problem wasn’t caused by stray static electricity. Those 
types of problems are very difficult to track down. Tell your users that 
not properly discharging themselves before using their computers can 
cause all kinds of problems.
	
✓	You need more memory.
	
✓	You need a bigger hard drive.
	
✓	You need a faster processor.
	
✓	Blame it on Jar-Jar Binks.
	
✓	You can’t do that in Windows 8.
	
✓	You can only do that in Windows 8.
	
✓	Could be a virus.
	
✓	Or sunspots.
	
✓	No beer and no TV make Homer something something something.

F

ace it: Networks are prone to breaking.
They have too many parts. Cables. Connectors. Cards. Switches. Routers. 
All these parts must be held together in a delicate balance, and the network 
equilibrium is all too easy to disturb. Even the best-designed computer net­
works sometimes act as if they’re held together with baling wire, chewing 
gum, and duct tape.
To make matters worse, networks breed suspicion. After your computer is 
attached to a network, users begin to blame the network every time some­
thing goes wrong, regardless of whether the problem has anything to do with 
the network. You can’t get columns to line up in a Word document? Must be the 
network. Your spreadsheet doesn’t add up? The @@#$% network’s acting up 
again. The stock market’s down? Arghhh!!!!!!
The worst thing about network failures is that sometimes they can shut down 
an entire company. It’s not so bad if just one user can’t access a particular 
shared folder on a file server. If a critical server goes down, however, your 
network users may be locked out of their files, applications, e-mail, and 
everything else they need to conduct business as usual. When that happens, 
they’ll be beating down your doors and won’t stop until you get the network 
back up and running.
In this chapter, I review some of the most likely causes of network trouble 
and suggest some basic troubleshooting techniques that you can employ 
when your network goes on the fritz.

292
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
When Bad Things Happen 
to Good Computers
Here are some basic troubleshooting steps explaining what you should 
examine at the first sign of network trouble. In many (if not most) of the 
cases, one of the following steps can get your network back up and running:
	
1.	Make sure that your computer and everything attached to it is 
plugged in.
	
	 Computer geeks love it when a user calls for help, and they get to tell the 
user that the computer isn’t plugged in or that its power strip is turned 
off. They write it down in their geek logs so that they can tell their geek 
friends about it later. They may even want to take your picture so that 
they can show it to their geek friends. (Most “accidents” involving 
computer geeks are a direct result of this kind of behavior. So try to be 
tactful when you ask a user whether he or she is sure the computer is 
actually turned on.)
	
2.	Make sure that your computer is properly connected to the network.
	
3.	Note any error messages that appear on-screen.
	
4.	Try restarting the computer.
	
	 An amazing number of computer problems are cleared up by a simple 
restart of the computer. Of course, in many cases, the problem recurs, 
so you’ll have to eventually isolate the cause and fix the problem. Some 
problems are only intermittent, and a simple reboot is all that’s needed.
	
5.	Try the built-in Windows network troubleshooter.
	
	 For more information, see the section, “Using the Windows Networking 
Troubleshooter,” later in this chapter.
	
6.	Check the free disk space on your computer and on the server.
	
	 When a computer runs out of disk space or comes close to it, strange 
things can happen. Sometimes you get a clear error message indicating 
such a situation, but not always. Sometimes the computer just grinds to 
a halt; operations that used to take a few seconds now take a few minutes.
	
7.	Do a little experimenting to find out whether the problem is indeed a 
network problem or just a problem with the computer itself.
	
	 See the section, “Time to Experiment,” later in this chapter, for some 
simple things that you can do to isolate a network problem.
	
8.	Try restarting the network server.
	
	 See the section, “Restarting a Network Server,” later in this chapter.

 Chapter 19: Solving Network Problems
Fixing Dead Computers
If a computer seems totally dead, here are some things to check:
	
✓	Make sure that the computer is plugged in.
	
✓	If the computer is plugged into a surge protector or a power strip, 
make sure that the surge protector or power strip is plugged in and 
turned on. If the surge protector or power strip has a light, it should be 
glowing. Also, the surge protector may have a reset button that needs to 
be pressed.
	
✓	Make sure that the computer’s On/Off switch is turned on. This advice 
sounds too basic to even include here, but many computers have two 
power switches: an on/off switch on the back of the computer and a 
push-button on the front that actually starts the computer. If you push 
the front button and nothing happens, check the switch on the back to 
make sure it’s in the ON position.
	
	To complicate matters, newer computers have a Sleep feature, in which 
they appear to be turned off but really they’re just sleeping. All you have 
to do to wake such a computer is jiggle the mouse a little. (I used to 
have an uncle like that.) It’s easy to assume that the computer is turned 
off, press the power button, wonder why nothing happened, and then 
press the power button and hold it down, hoping it will take. If you 
hold down the power button long enough, the computer will actually turn 
itself off. Then, when you turn the computer back on, you get a message 
saying the computer wasn’t shut down properly. Arghhh! The moral of the 
story is to jiggle the mouse if the computer seems to have nodded off.
	
✓	If you think the computer isn’t plugged in but it looks like it is, listen 
for the fan. If the fan is running, the computer is getting power, and the 
problem is more serious than an unplugged power cord. (If the fan isn’t 
running but the computer is plugged in and the power is on, the fan may 
be out to lunch.)
	
✓	If the computer is plugged in and turned on but still not running, plug 
a lamp into the outlet to make sure that power is getting to the outlet. 
You may need to reset a tripped circuit breaker or replace a bad surge 
protector. Or you may need to call the power company. (If you live in 
California, don’t bother calling the power company. It probably won’t do 
any good.)
	
✓	Check the surge protector. Surge protectors have a limited life span. After 
a few years of use, many surge protectors continue to provide electrical 
power for your computer, but the components that protect your computer 
from power surges no longer work. If you’re using a surge protector that 
is more than two or three years old, replace the old surge protector with 
a new one.

294
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
✓	Make sure that the monitor is plugged in and turned on. The monitor 
has a separate power cord and switch. (The monitor actually has two 
cables that must be plugged in. One runs from the back of the monitor 
to the back of the computer; the other is a power cord that comes from 
the back of the monitor and must be plugged into an electrical outlet.)
	
✓	Make sure that all cables are plugged in securely. Your keyboard, mon­
itor, mouse, and printer are all connected to the back of your computer 
by cables.
	
	Make sure that the other ends of the monitor and printer cables are 
plugged in properly, too.
	
✓	If the computer is running but the display is dark, try adjusting the 
monitor’s contrast and brightness. Some monitors have knobs that you 
can use to adjust the contrast and brightness of the monitor’s display. 
They may have been turned down all the way.
Ways to Check a Network Connection
The cables that connect client computers to the rest of the network are 
finicky beasts. They can break at a moment’s notice, and by “break,” I don’t 
necessarily mean “to physically break in two.” Although some broken cables 
look like someone got to the cable with pruning shears, most cable problems 
aren’t visible to the naked eye.
	
✓	Twisted-pair cable: If your network uses twisted-pair cable, you can 
quickly tell whether the cable connection to the network is good by 
looking at the back of your computer. Look for a small light located near 
where the cable plugs in; if this light is glowing steadily, the cable is 
good. If the light is dark or it’s flashing intermittently, you have a cable 
problem (or a problem with the network card or the hub or switch that 
the other end of the cable is plugged in to).
	
	If the light isn’t glowing steadily, try removing the cable from your com­
puter and reinserting it. This action may cure the weak connection.
	
✓	Patch cable: Hopefully, your network is wired so that each computer is 
connected to the network with a short (six feet or so) patch cable. One 
end of the patch cable plugs into the computer, and the other end plugs 
into a cable connector mounted on the wall. Try quickly disconnecting 
and reconnecting the patch cable. If that doesn’t do the trick, try to find 
a spare patch cable that you can use.
	
✓	Switches: Switches are prone to having cable problems, too — especially 
switches that are wired in a “professional manner,” involving a rat’s nest 
of patch cables. Be careful whenever you enter the lair of the rat’s nest. If 
you need to replace a patch cable, be very careful when you disconnect 
the suspected bad cable and reconnect the good cable in its place.

 Chapter 19: Solving Network Problems
A Bunch of Error Messages Just Flew By!
Error messages that display when your computer boots can provide invalu­
able clues to determine the source of the problem.
If you see error messages when you start up the computer, keep the following 
points in mind:
	
✓	Don’t panic if you see a lot of error messages. Sometimes, a simple 
problem that’s easy to correct can cause a plethora of error messages 
when you start your computer. The messages may look as if your com­
puter is falling to pieces, but the fix may be very simple.
	
✓	If the messages fly by so fast that you can’t see them, press your com­
puter’s Pause key. Your computer comes to a screeching halt, giving you 
a chance to catch up on your error-message reading. After you’ve read 
enough, press the Pause key again to get things moving. (On keyboards 
that don’t have a Pause key, pressing Ctrl+Num Lock or Ctrl+S does the 
same thing.)
	
✓	If you miss the error messages the first time, restart the computer and 
watch them again.
	
✓	Better yet, press F8 when you see the Starting Windows message. 
This displays a menu that allows you to select from several startup 
options.
Double-Checking Your Network Settings
I swear that there are little green men who sneak into offices at night, turn on 
computers, and mess up TCP/IP configuration settings just for kicks. These 
little green men are affectionately known as networchons.
Remarkably, network configuration settings sometimes get inadvertently 
changed so that a computer, which enjoyed the network for months or even 
years, one day finds itself unable to access the network. So one of the first 
things you do, after making sure that the computers are actually on and that 
the cables aren’t broken, is a basic review of the computer’s network settings. 
Check the following:
	
✓	At a command prompt, run ipconfig to make sure that TCP/IP is up 
and running on the computer and that the IP addresses, subnet masks, 
and default gateway settings look right.
	
✓	Call up the network connection’s Properties dialog box and make sure 
that the necessary protocols are installed correctly.

296
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
✓	Open the System Properties dialog box (double-click System in 
Control Panel) and check the Computer Name tab.
	
	Make sure that the computer name is unique and also that the domain 
or workgroup name is spelled properly.
	
✓	Double-check the user account to make sure that the user really has 
permission to access the resources he needs.
Using the Windows Networking 
Troubleshooter
Windows comes with a built-in troubleshooter that can often help you to pin 
down the cause of a network problem. Figure 19-1 shows the Windows 8 ver­
sion. Answer the questions asked by the troubleshooter and click Next to 
move from screen to screen. The Networking Troubleshooter can’t solve all 
networking problems, but it does point out the causes of the most common 
problems.

297
 Chapter 19: Solving Network Problems
The procedure for starting Networking Troubleshooter depends on which 
version of Windows you’re using:
	
✓	Windows 8 and Windows 7: Open Control Panel, click View Network 
Status and Tasks, and then click Troubleshoot Problems. Then select 
the troubleshooter that seems most directly related to the problem 
you’re experiencing. You’ll find troubleshooters for wireless network 
problems, home networks, and local area network (LAN) and Internet 
connections.
	
✓	Windows Vista: Choose Start➪Help and Support, click Troubleshooting, 
and then click the link for the network troubleshooter that seems most 
directly related to the problem you’re experiencing. You’ll find trouble­
shooters for wireless network problems, home networks, and LAN and 
Internet connections.
	
✓	Windows XP: Choose Start➪Help and Support➪Networking and the 
Web➪Fixing Network or Web Problems. Then click Home and Small 
Office Networking Troubleshooter.
Time to Experiment
If you can’t find some obvious explanation for your troubles — say, the com­
puter is unplugged — you need to do some experimenting to narrow down 
the possibilities. Design your experiments to answer one basic question: Is it 
a network problem or a local computer problem?
Here are some ways you can narrow down the cause of the problem:
	
✓	Try performing the same operation on someone else’s computer. If no 
one on the network can access a network drive or printer, something is 
probably wrong with the network. On the other hand, if the error occurs 
on only one computer, the problem is likely with that computer. The 
wayward computer may not be reliably communicating with the network 
or configured properly for the network, or the problem may have nothing 
to do with the network at all.
	
✓	If you can perform the operation on another computer without problems, 
try logging on to the network with another computer using your own 
username. Then see whether you can perform the operation without 
error. If you can, the problem is probably on your computer. If you can’t, 
the problem may be with the way your user account is configured.
	
✓	If you can’t log on at another computer, try waiting for a bit. Your 
account may be temporarily locked out. This can happen for a variety of 
reasons — the most common of which is trying to log on with the wrong 
password several times in a row. If you’re still locked out an hour later, 
call the network administrator and offer a doughnut.

Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
Who’s on First?
When troubleshooting a networking problem, find out who is actually logged 
on to a network server. For example, if a user can’t access a file on the server, 
you can check whether the user is logged on. If so, you know that the user’s 
account is valid. Even so, the user may not have permission to access the 
particular file or folder that he’s attempting to access. On the other hand, if 
the user isn’t logged on, the problem may lie with the account itself or how 
the user is attempting to connect to the server.
I also recommend finding out who’s logged on in case you need to restart 
the server. For more information about restarting a server, see the section, 
“Restarting a Network Server,” later in this chapter.
To find out who is currently logged on to a Windows server, right-click the 
Computer icon on the desktop and choose Manage from the menu that appears. 
This brings up the Computer Management window. Open System Tools in 
the tree list and then open Shared Folders and select Sessions. A list of users 
who are logged on appears.
	
You can immediately disconnect all users by right-clicking Sessions in the 
Computer Management window and choosing All Tasks➪Disconnect All. Be 
warned, however, that this can cause users to lose data.
Restarting a Client Computer
Sometimes, trouble gets a computer so tied up in knots that the only thing 
you can do is reboot. In some cases, the computer just starts acting weird. 
Strange characters appear on the screen, or Windows goes haywire and 
doesn’t let you exit a program. Sometimes, the computer gets so confused 
that it can’t even move. It just sits there, like a deer staring at oncoming head­
lights. It won’t move, no matter how hard you press Esc or Enter. You can 
move the mouse all over your desktop, or you can even throw it across the 
room, but the mouse pointer on the screen stays perfectly still.
When a computer starts acting strange, you need to reboot. If you must reboot, 
you should do so as cleanly as possible. I know this procedure may seem 
elementary, but the technique for safely restarting a client computer is worth 
repeating, even if it is basic:

299
 Chapter 19: Solving Network Problems
	
1.	Save your work if you can.
	
	 Use the File➪Save command to save any documents or files that you were 
editing when things started to go haywire. If you can’t use the menus, try 
clicking the Save button on the toolbar. If that doesn’t work, try pressing 
Ctrl+S (the standard keyboard shortcut for the Save command).
	
2.	Close any running programs if you can.
	
	 Use the File➪Exit command or click the Close button in the upper-right 
corner of the program window. Or press Alt+F4.
	
	 If a program refuses to close, you can usually shut it down by using 
Windows Task Manager. Right-click the Windows task bar and choose 
Start Task Manager. Then select the program you want to close and click 
the End Task button.
	
3.	Restart the computer.
 
• Windows XP: Choose Start➪Turn Off Computer to summon the 
Shut Down Windows dialog box. Select the Restart option and then 
click OK.
 
• Windows 7 and Vista: Click the Start button, click the right arrow 
that appears at the bottom-right corner of the Start menu, and then 
click Restart.
 
• Windows 8: Oddly enough, shutting down Windows 8 is a bit chal­
lenging. You can stare at the Windows 8 desktop all day and not 
find an intuitive way to shut down your computer. The secret lies 
in the Charms Bar, which you can find by hovering the mouse over 
the lower-right corner of the screen. Next, click the Settings icon, 
and then click the Shut Down icon.
If restarting your computer doesn’t seem to fix the problem, you may need to 
turn off your computer and then turn it on again. To do so, follow the previous 
procedure but choose Shut Down instead of Restart.
Here are a few things to try if you have trouble restarting your computer:
	
1.	If your computer refuses to respond to the Start➪Shut Down command, 
try pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
	
	 This is called the “three-finger salute.” It’s appropriate to say, “Queueue” 
while you do it.
	
	 When you press Ctrl+Alt+Delete, Windows displays a dialog box that 
enables you to close any running programs or shut down your computer 
entirely.

300
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
2.	If pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete doesn’t do anything, you’ve reached the 
last resort. The only thing left to do is turn off the computer by press­
ing the power On/Off button and holding it down for a few seconds.
	
	 Turning off your computer by pressing the power button is a drastic 
action that you should take only after your computer becomes com­
pletely unresponsive. Any work you haven’t yet saved to disk is lost. 
(Sniff.) (If your computer doesn’t have a Reset button, turn off the com­
puter, wait a few moments, and then turn the computer back on again.)
	
If at all possible, save your work before restarting your computer. Any work 
you haven’t saved is lost. Unfortunately, if your computer is totally tied up in 
knots, you probably can’t save your work. In that case, you have no choice but 
to push your computer off the digital cliff.
Booting in Safe Mode
Windows provides a special start-up mode called Safe Mode that’s designed 
to help fix misbehaving computers. When you start your computer in Safe 
Mode, Windows loads only the most essential parts of itself into memory — 
the bare minimum required for Windows to work. Safe Mode is especially 
useful when your computer has developed a problem that prevents you from 
using the computer at all.
To boot your computer in Safe Mode, first restart the computer. Then, as 
soon as the computer begins to restart, start pressing the F8 key — just tap 
away at it until a menu titled Advanced Boot Options appears. One of the 
options on this menu is Safe Mode; use the up- or down-arrow keys to select 
that option, and then press Enter to boot in Safe Mode.
Using System Restore
System Restore is a Windows feature that periodically saves important 
Windows configuration information and allows you to later return your 
system to a previously saved configuration. This can often fix problems by 
reverting your computer to a time when it was working.
By default, Windows saves restore points whenever you install new software 
on your computer or apply a system update. Restore points are also saved 
automatically every seven days.
Although System Restore is turned on by default, you should verify that 
System Restore is active and running to make sure that System Restore 
points are being created. To do that, right-click Computer from the Start 
menu, choose Properties, and then click the System Protection tab. The 

301
 Chapter 19: Solving Network Problems
dialog box shown in Figure 19-2 is displayed. Verify that the Protection status 
for your computer’s C: drive is On. If it isn’t, select the C: drive and click the 
Configure button to configure System Restore for the drive.
	
Figure 19-2: 
The System 
Protection 
tab of the 
System 
Properties 
dialog box.
	
If your computer develops a problem, you can restore it to a previously 
saved restore point by clicking the System Protection tab. This brings up the 
System Restore Wizard, as shown in Figure 19-3. This wizard allows you to 
select the restore point you want to use.
	
Figure 19-3: 
Use System 
Restore to

system to an

302
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
Here are a few additional thoughts to remember about System Restore:
	
✓	System Restore does not delete data files from your system. Thus, files in 
your Documents folder won’t be lost.
	
✓	System Restore does remove any applications or system updates you’ve 
installed since the restore point was made. Thus, you need to reinstall 
those applications or system updates — unless, of course, you deter­
mine that an application or system update was the cause of your prob­
lem in the first place.
	
✓	System Restore automatically restarts your computer. The restart may 
be slow because some of the changes made by System Restore happen 
after the restart.
	
✓	Do not turn off or cut power to your computer during System Restore. 
Doing so may leave your computer in an unrecoverable state.
Restarting Network Services
Once in a while, the operating system (OS) service that supports the task 
that’s causing you trouble inexplicably stops or gets stuck. If users can’t 
access a server, it may be because one of the key network services has 
stopped or is stuck.
You can review the status of services by using the Services tool, as shown 
in Figure 19-4. To display it, right-click Computer from the Start menu and 
choose Manage; then, expand the Services and Applications node and click 
Services. Review this list to make sure that all key services are running. If an 
important service is paused or stopped, restart it.
Which services qualify as “important” depends on what roles you define 
for the server. Table 19-1 lists a few important services that are common to 
most Windows network operating systems (NOSes). However, many servers 
require additional services besides these. In fact, a typical server will have 
many dozens of services running simultaneously.

Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. If this service is dis­
abled, the computer’s IP address won’t be configured properly.
DNS Client
Enables the computer to access a Domain Name Server (DNS) 
server to resolve DNS names. If this service is disabled, the 
computer won’t be able to handle DNS names, including Internet 
addresses and Active Directory (AD) names.
Server
Provides basic file- and printer-sharing services for the server. 
If this service is stopped, clients won’t be able to connect to the 
server to access files or printers.

Enables the computer to establish client connections with other 
servers. If this service is disabled, the computer won’t be able to 
connect to other servers.

304
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
Key services usually stop for a reason, so simply restarting a stopped service 
probably won’t solve your network’s problem — at least, not for long. You 
should review the System log to look for any error messages that may explain 
why the service stopped in the first place.
Restarting a Network Server
Sometimes, the only way to flush out a network problem is to restart the 
network server that’s experiencing trouble.
	
Restarting a network server is something you should do only as a last resort. 
Windows Server is designed to run for months or even years at a time without 
rebooting. Restarting a server invariably results in a temporary shutdown 
of the network. If you must restart a server, try to do it during off hours if 
possible.
	
Before you restart a server, check whether a specific service that’s required 
has been paused or stopped. You may be able to just restart the individual 
service rather than the entire server. For more information, see the section, 
“Restarting Network Services,” earlier in this chapter.
Here’s the basic procedure for restarting a network server:
	
1.	Make sure that everyone is logged off the server.
	
	 The easiest way to do that is to restart the server after normal business 
hours, when everyone has gone home for the day. Then, you can just 
shut down the server and let the shutdown process forcibly log off any 
remaining users.
	
	 To find out who’s logged on, refer to the earlier section, “Who’s on First?”
	
2.	After you’re sure the users have logged off, shut down the network 
server.
	
	 You want to do this step behaving like a good citizen if possible — 
decently, and in order. Use the Start➪Shut Down command to shut 
down the server. This summons a dialog box that requires you to indi­
cate the reason for the shutdown. The information you supply here is 
entered into the server’s System log, which you can review by using 
Event Viewer. See the next section for more on Event Viewer.
	
3.	Reboot the server computer or turn it off and then on again.
	
	 Watch the server start up to make sure that no error messages appear.
	
4.	Tell everyone to log back on and make sure that everyone can now 
access the network.

305
 Chapter 19: Solving Network Problems
	
Heed the following when you consider restarting the network server:
	
✓	Restarting the network server is more drastic than restarting a client 
computer. Make sure that everyone saves his or her work and logs 
off the network before you do it! You can cause major problems if you 
blindly turn off the server computer while users are logged on.
	
✓	Obviously, restarting a network server is a major inconvenience to 
every network user. Better offer treats.
Looking at Event Logs
One of the most useful troubleshooting techniques for diagnosing network 
problems is to review the network operating system’s built-in event logs. These 
logs contain information about interesting and potentially troublesome events 
that occur during the daily operation of your network. Ordinarily, these logs 
run in the background, quietly gathering information about network events. 
When something goes wrong, you can check the logs to see whether the prob­
lem generated a noteworthy event. In many cases, the event logs contain an 
entry that pinpoints the exact cause of the problem and suggests a solution.
To display the event logs in a Windows server, use Event Viewer, which 
is available from the Administrative Tools menu. For example, Figure 19-5 
shows an Event Viewer from a Windows Server 2012 system. The tree list­
ing on the left side of Event Viewer lists five categories of events that are 
tracked: Application, Security, Setup, System, and Forwarded Events. Select 
one of these options to see the log that you want to view. For details about a 
particular event, double-click the event to display a dialog box with detailed 
information about the event.

Documenting Your Trials and Tribulations
For a large network, you probably want to invest in problem-management soft­
ware that tracks each problem through the entire process of troubleshooting, 
from initial report to final resolution. For small- and medium-sized networks, 
it’s probably sufficient to put together a three-ring binder with pre-printed 
forms. Or record your log in a Word document or an Excel spreadsheet.
Regardless of how you track your network problems, the tracking log should 
include the following information:
	
✓	The real name and the network username of the person reporting the 
problem
	
✓	The date the problem was first reported
	
✓	An indication of the severity of the problem
	
	Is it merely an inconvenience, or is a user unable to complete his or her 
work because of the problem? Does a workaround exist?
	
✓	The name of the person assigned to resolve the problem
	
✓	A description of the problem
	
✓	A list of the software involved, including versions
	
✓	A description of the steps taken to solve the problem
	
✓	A description of any intermediate steps that were taken to try to solve 
the problem, along with an indication of whether those steps were 
“undone” when they didn’t help solve the problem
	
✓	The date the problem was finally resolved

f you’re the hapless network manager, the safety of the data on your 
network is your responsibility. In fact, it’s your primary responsibility. 
You get paid to lie awake at night worrying about your data. Will it be there 
tomorrow? If it’s not, can you get it back? And — most important — if you 
can’t get it back, will you have a job tomorrow?
This chapter covers the ins and outs of being a good, responsible, trustworthy 
network manager. No one gives out merit badges for this stuff, but someone 
should.
Backing Up Your Data
Having data backed up is the cornerstone of any disaster recovery plan. 
Without backups, a simple hard drive failure can set your company back 
days or even weeks while it tries to reconstruct lost data. In fact, without 
backups, your company’s very existence is in jeopardy.
	
The fundamental goal of backing up is simple: Keep a spare copy of your 
network’s critical data so that no matter what happens, you never lose more 
than one day’s work. The stock market may crash, Earth may be hit by a giant 
asteroid, or the Cleveland Browns might win the Super Bowl. But as long as 
you’re on top of your backups, you’ll survive.

308
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
The way to meet the primary goal of backups is, naturally, to make sure that 
data is reliably backed up every day. For many networks, you can back up all 
the network hard drives every night. And even if full nightly backups aren’t 
possible, you can still use techniques that can ensure that every file on the 
network has a backup copy that’s no more than one day old.
Choosing Where to Back Up Your Data
If you plan on backing up the data on your network server’s hard drives, you 
obviously need some type of media on which to back up the data. You could 
copy the data onto CDs, but a 500GB hard drive would need more than 750 
CDs for a full backup. That’s a few more discs than most people want to keep 
in the closet. You could use DVDs, but you’ll still need about a dozen of them, 
as well as an hour or so to fill each one. Sigh. That means devoting every 
Saturday to creating your backups.
	
Because of the limitations of CDs and DVDs, most network administrators 
back up network data to some other type of storage device. The three most 
common options are
	
✓	Tape: Magnetic tape, the oldest storage medium for backups, is still one 
of the most widely used types. One of the biggest advantages of tape 
backups is that tape cartridges are small and can thus be easily trans­
ported to an offsite location.
	
✓	Network Attached Storage (NAS): A Network Attached Storage device 
connects directly to your network. NAS devices are often used as backup 
devices because they are inexpensive. In addition, they are relatively 
small and easy to remove, so like tape, they can be transported offsite.
	
✓	Cloud backup: An increasingly popular option is to use a third-party 
service to back up your data to a remote location via the Internet. Cloud 
backup has the advantage of already being offsite.
Backing Up to Tape
Another benefit of using a tape backup is that you can run it unattended. In 
fact, you can schedule a tape backup to run automatically during off hours 
when no one is using the network. For unattended backups to work, though, 
you must ensure that you have enough tape capacity to back up your entire 
network server’s hard drive without having to manually switch tapes. If your 
network server has only 100GB of data, you can easily back it up onto a single 
tape. If you have 1,000GB of data, however, invest in a tape drive that features 

309
 Chapter 20: Backing Up Your Data
a magazine changer that can hold several tapes and automatically cycle them 
in and out of the drive. That way, you can run your backups unattended.
You have several distinct types of tape backup systems to choose from:
	
✓	Travan drives: A popular style of tape backup for small servers is a 
Travan drive, which comes in a variety of models with tape capacities 
ranging from 20GB to 40GB. You can purchase a 20GB drive for less 
than $200.
	
✓	DAT, DLT, and LTO units: For larger networks, you can get tape backup 
units that offer higher capacity and faster backup speed than Travan 
drives — for more money, of course. Digital audio tape (DAT) units can 
back up as much as 80GB on a single tape, and DLT (digital linear tape) 
drives can store up to 800GB on one tape. Linear tape open (LTO) drives 
can store 1.5TB on a single tape. DAT, DLT, and LTO drives can cost 
$1,000 or more, depending on the capacity.
	
✓	Robotic units: If you’re really up the backup creek, with hundreds of 
gigabytes to back up, you can get robotic tape backup units that auto­
matically fetch and load tape cartridges from a library. That way, you 
can do complete backups without having to load tapes manually. As you 
can likely guess, these units aren’t inexpensive: Small ones, which have 
a library of about eight tapes and a total backup capacity of more than 
5,000GB, start at about $4,000.
Understanding Backup Software
All versions of Windows come with a built-in backup program. In addition, 
most tape drives come with backup programs that are often faster or more 
flexible than the standard Windows backup.
You can also purchase sophisticated backup programs that are specially 
designed for networks that have multiple servers with data that must be 
backed up. For a basic Windows file server, you can use the backup program 
that comes with Windows Server. Server versions of Windows come with a 
decent backup program that can run scheduled, unattended tape backups.
Backup programs do more than just copy data from your hard drive to tape. 
Backup programs use special compression techniques to squeeze your data 
so that you can cram more data onto fewer tapes. Compression factors of 2:1 
are common, so you can usually squeeze 100GB of data onto a tape that would 
hold only 50GB of data without compression. (Tape drive manufacturers tend 
to state the capacity of their drives by using compressed data, assuming a 

310
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
2:1 compression ratio. Thus, a 200GB tape has an uncompressed capacity of 
100GB.)
	
Whether you achieve a compression factor of 2:1 depends on the nature of the 
data you’re backing up:
	
✓	Documents: If your network is used primarily for Microsoft Office appli­
cations and is filled with Word and Excel documents, you’ll probably get 
better than 2:1 compression.
	
✓	Graphics: If your network data consists primarily of graphic image files, 
you probably won’t get much compression. Most graphic image file for­
mats are already compressed, so they can’t be compressed much more 
by the backup software’s compression methods.
Backup programs also help you keep track of which data has been backed up 
and which hasn’t. They also offer options, such as incremental or differential 
backups that can streamline the backup process, as I describe in the next 
section.
	
If your network has more than one server, invest in good backup software. The 
most popular is Yosemite Backup, made by BarracudaWare (www.barracuda
ware.com). Besides being able to handle multiple servers, one of the main 
advantages of backup software (such as Yosemite Backup) is that it can 
properly back up Microsoft Exchange server data.
Comparing Types of Backups
You can perform five different types of backups. Many backup schemes rely 
on full daily backups, but for some networks, using a scheme that relies on 
two or more of these backup types is more practical.
The differences among the five types of backups involve a little technical 
detail known as the “archive bit,” which indicates whether a file has been 
modified since it was backed up. The archive bit is a little flag stored along 
with the filename, creation date, and other directory information. Any time 
a program modifies a file, the archive bit is set to the On position. That way, 
backup programs know that the file has been modified and needs to be 
backed up.
The differences among the various types of backups center on whether they 
use the archive bit to determine which files to back up, as well as whether 
they flip the archive bit to the Off position after they back up a file. Table 20-1 
summarizes these differences, which I explain in the following sections.

311
 Chapter 20: Backing Up Your Data
	
Backup programs allow you to select any combination of drives and folders to 
back up. As a result, you can customize the file selection for a backup opera­
tion to suit your needs. For example, you can set up one backup plan that 
backs up all a server’s shared folders and drives, plus its mail server stores, 
but then leaves out folders that rarely change, such as the operating system 
folders or installed program folders. You can then back up those folders on a 
less-regular basis. The drives and folders that you select for a backup opera­
tion are collectively called the backup selection.

The archive bit would have made a good Abbott and Costello routine. (“All 
right, I wanna know who modified the archive bit.” “What.” “Who?” “No, What.” 
“Wait a minute . . . just tell me what’s the name of the guy who modified the 
archive bit!” “Right.”)
Normal backups
A normal backup — also called a full backup — is the basic type of backup. In 
a normal backup, all files in the backup selection are backed up regardless of 
whether the archive bit has been set. In other words, the files are backed up 
even if they haven’t been modified since the last time they were backed up. 
When each file is backed up, its archive bit is reset, so backups that select 
files based on the archive bit setting won’t back up the files.
When a normal backup finishes, none of the files in the backup selection has 
its archive bit set. As a result, if you immediately follow a normal backup with 
an incremental backup or a differential backup, files won’t be selected for 
backup by the incremental or differential backup because no file will have its 
archive bit set.

312
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
The easiest backup scheme is to simply schedule a normal backup every 
night. That way, all your data is backed up on a daily basis. Then, if the need 
arises, you can restore files from a single tape or set of tapes. Restoring files 
is more complicated when other types of backups are involved.
	
Do normal backups nightly if you have the tape capacity to do them unat­
tended — that is, without having to swap tapes. If you can’t do an unattended 
normal backup because the amount of data to be backed up is greater than 
the capacity of your tape drive(s), you have to use other types of backups in 
combination with normal backups.
	
If you can’t get a normal backup on a single tape, and you can’t afford a 
second tape drive or a tape changer, take a hard look at the data that’s being 
included in the backup selection. I recently worked on a network that was dif­
ficult to back up onto a single tape. When I examined the data that was being 
backed up, I discovered a large amount of static data that was essentially an 
online archive of old projects. This data was necessary because network users 
needed it for research purposes, but the data was read-only. Even though the 
data never changed, it was being backed up to tape every night, and the back­
ups required two tapes. After I removed this data from the cycle of nightly 
backups, the backups were able to squeeze onto a single tape again.
If you remove static data from the nightly backup, make sure that you have a 
secure backup of the static data on tape, CD-RW, or some other media.
Copy backups
A copy backup is similar to a normal backup except that the archive bit isn’t 
reset when each file is copied. As a result, copy backups don’t disrupt the 
cycle of normal and incremental or differential backups.
Copy backups usually aren’t incorporated into regular, scheduled backups. 
Instead, you use a copy backup when you want to do an occasional one-shot 
backup. If you’re about to perform an operating system upgrade, for example, 
you should back up the server before proceeding. If you do a full backup, 
the archive bits are reset, and your regular backups are disrupted. If you 
do a copy backup, however, the archive bits of any modified files remain 
unchanged. As a result, your regular normal and incremental or differential 
backups are unaffected.
If you don’t incorporate incremental or differential backups into your backup 
routine, the difference between a copy backup and a normal backup is moot.

313
 Chapter 20: Backing Up Your Data
Daily backups
A daily backup backs up just those files that changed the same day when 
the backup was performed. A daily backup examines the modification date 
stored with each file’s directory entry to determine whether a file should be 
backed up. Daily backups don’t reset the archive bit.
	
I’m not a big fan of this option because of the small possibility that some files 
may slip through the cracks. Someone may be working late one night and 
modify a file after the evening’s backups have completed — but before mid­
night — meaning that those files won’t be included in the following night’s 
backups. Incremental or differential backups, which rely on the archive bit 
rather than the modification date, are more reliable.
Incremental backups
An incremental backup backs up only those files that were modified since 
the last time you did a backup. Incremental backups are a lot faster than full 
backups because your network users probably modify only a small portion 
of the files on the server on any given day. As a result, if a full backup takes 
three tapes, you can probably fit an entire week’s worth of incremental back­
ups on a single tape.
When an incremental backup copies each file, it resets the file’s archive bit. 
That way, the file will be backed up again before your next normal backup 
only when a user modifies the file again.
Here are some thoughts about using incremental backups:
	
✓	The easiest way to use incremental backups is the following:
 
• A normal backup every Monday
	
	If your full backup takes more than 12 hours, you may want to do it 
on Friday so that it can run over the weekend.
 
• An incremental backup on each remaining normal business day (for 
example, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday)
	
✓	When you use incremental backups, the complete backup consists of 
the full backup tapes and all the incremental backup tapes that you’ve 
made since you did the full backup.
	
	If the hard drive crashes, and you have to restore the data onto a new 
drive, you first restore Monday’s normal backup and then restore each 
of the subsequent incremental backups.

314
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
✓	Incremental backups complicate restoring individual files because the 
most recent copy of the file may be on the full backup tape or on any 
of the incremental backups.
	
	Backup programs keep track of the location of the most recent version 
of each file to simplify the process.
	
✓	When you use incremental backups, you can choose whether you 
want to
 
• Store each incremental backup on its own tape.
 
• Append each backup to the end of an existing tape.
	
	Often, you can use a single tape for a week of incremental backups.
Differential backups
A differential backup is similar to an incremental backup except that it doesn’t 
reset the archive bit when files are backed up. As a result, each differential 
backup represents the difference between the last normal backup and the 
current state of the hard drive.
To do a full restore from a differential backup, you first restore the last 
normal backup and then restore the most recent differential backup.
Suppose that you do a normal backup on Monday and differential backups 
on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and your hard drive crashes Friday 
morning. On Friday afternoon, you install a new hard drive. To restore the 
data, you first restore the normal backup from Monday. Then you restore the 
differential backup from Thursday. The Tuesday and Wednesday differential 
backups aren’t needed.
The main difference between incremental and differential backups is that
	
✓	Incremental backups result in smaller and faster backups.
	
✓	Differential backups are easier to restore.
	
	If your users often ask you to restore individual files, consider using 
differential backups.
Choosing between Local 
and Network Backups
When you back up network data, you have two basic approaches to running 
the backup software:

315
 Chapter 20: Backing Up Your Data
	
✓	You can perform a local backup, in which the backup software runs on 
the file server itself and backs up data to a tape drive that’s installed in 
the server.
	
✓	Or you can perform a network backup, in which you use one network 
computer to back up data from another network computer. In a network 
backup, the data has to travel over the network to get to the computer 
that’s running the backup.
If you run the backups from the file server, you’ll tie up the server while 
the backup is running, and users will complain that their server access has 
slowed to a snail’s pace. On the other hand, if you run the backup over the 
network from a client computer or a dedicated backup server, you’ll flood 
the network with gigabytes of data being backed up. Then your users will 
complain that the entire network has slowed to a snail’s pace.
Network performance is one of the main reasons why you should try to run 
your backups during off hours, when other users aren’t accessing the net­
work. Another reason to run backups during off hours is so that you can per­
form a more thorough backup. If you run your backup while other users are 
accessing files, the backup program is likely to skip any files that are being 
accessed by users at the time the backup runs. As a result, your backup 
won’t include those files. Ironically, the files most likely to get left out of the 
backup are often the files that need backing up the most, because they’re the 
files that are being used and modified.
Here are some extra thoughts on client and server backups:
	
✓	Backing up directly from the server isn’t necessarily more efficient 
than backing up from a client because data doesn’t have to travel over 
the network. The network may well be faster than the tape drive. The 
network probably won’t slow down backups unless you back up during 
the busiest time of the day, when hordes of network users are storming 
the network gates.
	
✓	To improve network backup speed and to minimize the effect that 
network backups have on the rest of the network, consider using a 
1,000 Mbps switch instead of a normal 100 Mbps switch to connect the 
servers and the backup client. That way, network traffic between the 
server and the backup client won’t bog down the rest of the network.
	
✓	Any files that are open while the backups are running won’t get 
backed up. That’s usually not a problem, because backups are run at off 
hours when people have gone home. If someone leaves his computer on 
with a Word document open, however, that Word document won’t be 
backed up. One way to solve this problem is to set up the server so that 
it automatically logs everyone off the network before the backups begin.

316
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
✓	Some backup programs have special features that enable them to back 
up open files. The backup programs that come with Windows Server 
(versions 2003 and later) do this by creating a snapshot of the volume 
when it begins, thus making temporary copies of any files that are modi­
fied during the backup. The backup backs up the temporary copies 
rather than the versions being modified. When the backup finishes, the 
temporary copies are deleted.
Deciding How Many Sets 
of Backups to Keep
Don’t try to cut costs by purchasing one backup tape and reusing it every 
day. What happens if you accidentally delete an important file on Tuesday 
and don’t discover your mistake until Thursday? Because the file didn’t exist 
on Wednesday, it won’t be on Wednesday’s backup tape. If you have only one 
tape that’s reused every day, you’re outta luck.
The safest scheme is to use a new backup tape every day and keep all your 
old tapes in a vault. Pretty soon, though, your tape vault can start looking 
like the warehouse where they stored the Ark of the Covenant at the end of 
Raiders of the Lost Ark.
	
As a compromise between these two extremes, most users purchase several 
tapes and rotate them. That way, you always have several backup tapes to fall 
back on, just in case the file you need isn’t on the most recent backup tape. 
This technique is tape rotation, and several variations are commonly used:
	
✓	The simplest approach is to purchase three tapes and label them A, B, 
and C. You use the tapes on a daily basis in sequence: A the first day, 
B the second day, and C the third day; then A the fourth day, B the fifth 
day, C the sixth day, and so on. On any given day, you have three gener­
ations of backups: today’s, yesterday’s, and the day-before-yesterday’s. 
Computer geeks like to call these the grandfather, father, and son tapes.
	
✓	Another simple approach is to purchase five tapes and use one each 
day of the workweek.
	
✓	A variation of the preceding bullet is to buy eight tapes. Take four 
of them, and write Tuesday on one label, Wednesday on the second, 
Thursday on the third, and Friday on the fourth label. On the other four 
tapes, write Monday 1, Monday 2, Monday 3, and Monday 4. Now tack up 
a calendar on the wall near the computer, and number all the Mondays 
in the year: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

317
 Chapter 20: Backing Up Your Data
	
	On Tuesday through Friday, you use the appropriate daily backup tape. 
When you run a full backup on Monday, consult the calendar to decide 
which Monday tape to use. With this scheme, you always have four 
weeks’ worth of Monday backup tapes, plus individual backup tapes for 
the rest of the week.
	
✓	If bookkeeping data lives on the network, make a backup copy of all 
your files (or at least all your accounting files) immediately before 
closing the books each month; then retain those backups for each 
month of the year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you should pur­
chase 12 additional tapes. If you back up just your accounting files, you 
can probably fit all 12 months on a single tape. Just make sure that you 
back up with the Append to Tape option rather than the Erase Tape 
option so that the previous contents of the tape aren’t destroyed. Also, 
treat this accounting backup as completely separate from your normal 
daily backup routine.
	
Keep at least one recent full backup at another location. That way, if your 
office should fall victim to an errant Scud missile or a rogue asteroid, you can 
re-create your data from the backup copy that you stored offsite. Make sure 
that the person entrusted with the task of taking the backups to this offsite 
location is trustworthy.
Verifying Tape Reliability
From experience, I’ve found that although tape drives are very reliable, they 
do run amok once in a while. The problem is that they don’t always tell you 
when they’re not working. A tape drive (especially one of the less-expensive 
Travan drives; refer to “Backing Up to Tape,” earlier in this chapter) can spin 
along for hours, pretending to back up your data — but in reality, your data 
isn’t being written reliably to the tape. In other words, a tape drive can trick 
you into thinking that your backups are working just fine. Then, when disas­
ter strikes and you need your backup tapes, you may just discover that the 
tapes are worthless.
	
Don’t panic! Here’s a simple way to assure yourself that your tape drive is 
working. Just activate the “compare after backup” feature of your backup 
software. As soon as your backup program finishes backing up your data, it 
rewinds the tape, reads each backed-up file, and compares it with the original 
version on the hard drive. If all files compare, you know that your backups are 
trustworthy.

318
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
Here are some additional thoughts about the reliability of tapes:
	
✓	The compare-after-backup feature doubles the time required to do a 
backup, but that doesn’t matter if your entire backup fits on one tape. 
You can just run the backup after hours. Whether the backup and repair 
operation takes one hour or ten doesn’t matter, as long as it’s finished 
by the time the network users arrive at work the next morning.
	
✓	If your backups require more than one tape, you may not want to run 
the compare-after-backup feature every day. Be sure to run it periodi­
cally, however, to check that your tape drive is working.
	
✓	If your backup program reports errors, throw away the tape, and use a 
new tape.
	
✓	Actually, you should ignore that last comment about waiting for your 
backup program to report errors. You should discard tapes before your 
backup program reports errors. Most experts recommend that you 
should use a tape only about 20 times before discarding it. If you use the 
same tape every day, replace it monthly. If you have tapes for each day 
of the week, replace them twice yearly. If you have more tapes than that, 
figure out a cycle that replaces tapes after about 20 uses.
Keeping Backup Equipment 
Clean and Reliable
An important aspect of backup reliability is proper maintenance of your tape 
drives. Every time you back up to tape, little bits and specks of the tape rub 
off onto the read and write heads inside the tape drive. Eventually, the heads 
become too dirty to read or write data reliably.
To counteract this problem, clean the tape heads regularly. The easiest way 
to clean them is to use a cleaning cartridge for the tape drive. The drive auto­
matically recognizes when you insert a cleaning cartridge and then performs 
a routine that wipes the cleaning tape back and forth over the heads to clean 
them. When the cleaning routine is done, the tape is ejected. The whole process 
takes only about 30 seconds.
Because the maintenance requirements of drives differ, check each drive’s 
user’s manual to find out how and how often to clean the drive. As a general 
rule, clean drives once weekly.
The most annoying aspect of tape drive cleaning is that the cleaning cartridges 
have a limited life span, and unfortunately, if you insert a used-up cleaning 

319
 Chapter 20: Backing Up Your Data
cartridge, the drive accepts it and pretends to clean the drive. For this 
reason, keep track of how many times you use a cleaning cartridge and 
replace it as recommended by the manufacturer.
Setting Backup Security
Backups create an often-overlooked security exposure for your network: 
No matter how carefully you set up user accounts and enforce password 
policies, if any user (including a guest) can perform a backup of the system, 
that user may make an unauthorized backup. In addition, your backup tapes 
themselves are vulnerable to theft. As a result, make sure that your backup 
policies and procedures are secure by taking the following measures:
	
✓	Set up a user account for the user who does backups. Because this user 
account has backup permission for the entire server, guard its password 
carefully. Anyone who knows the username and password of the backup 
account can log on and bypass any security restrictions that you place 
on that user’s normal user ID.
	
✓	Counter potential security problems by restricting the backup user ID 
to a certain client and a certain time of the day. If you’re really clever 
(and paranoid), you can probably set up the backup user’s account so 
that the only program it can run is the backup program.
	
✓	Use encryption to protect the contents of your backup tapes.
	
✓	Secure the backup tapes in a safe location, such as . . . um, a safe.

efore you had a network, computer security was easy. You simply 
locked your door when you left work for the day. You could rest easy, 
secure in the knowledge that the bad guys would have to break down the 
door to get to your computer.
The network changes all that. Now, anyone with access to any computer on 
the network can break into the network and steal your files. Not only do you 
have to lock your door, but you have to make sure that other people lock 
their doors, too.
Fortunately, network operating systems (NOSes) have built-in provisions for 
network security, deterring someone from stealing your files even if he does 
break down the door. All modern NOSEs have security features that are more 
than adequate for all but the most paranoid users.
	
When I say more than adequate, I mean it. Most networks have security features 
that would make even Maxwell Smart happy. Using all these security features 
is kind of like Smart insisting that the Chief lower the “Cone of Silence” (which 
worked so well that Max and the Chief couldn’t hear each other!). Don’t make 
your system so secure that even the good guys can’t get their work done.
	
If any computer on your network is connected to the Internet, you must 
harden your network against intrusion via the Internet. For more information, 
see Chapter 23. Also, if your network supports wireless devices, you have 
wireless security issues. For information about security for wireless networks, 
see Chapter 9.

322
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
Do You Need Security?
Most small networks are in small businesses or departments where everyone 
knows and trusts everyone else. Folks don’t lock up their desks when they 
take a coffee break, and although everyone knows where the petty cash box 
is, money never disappears.
Network security isn’t necessary in an idyllic setting like this one, is it? You 
bet it is. Here’s why any network should be set up with at least some concern 
for security:
	
✓	Even in the friendliest office environment, some information is and 
should be confidential. If this information is stored on the network, you 
want to store it in a directory that’s available only to authorized users.
	
✓	Not all security breaches are malicious. A network user may be routinely 
scanning through files and come across a filename that isn’t familiar. 
The user may then call up the file, only to discover that it contains 
confidential personnel information, juicy office gossip, or your résumé. 
Curiosity, rather than malice, is often the source of security breaches.
	
✓	Sure, everyone at the office is trustworthy now. However, what if some­
one becomes disgruntled, a screw pops loose, and he decides to trash 
the network files before jumping out the window? What if someone 
decides to print a few $1,000 checks before packing off to Tahiti?
	
✓	Sometimes the mere opportunity for fraud or theft can be too much for 
some people to resist. Give people free access to the payroll files, and 
they may decide to vote themselves a raise when no one is looking.
	
✓	If you think that your network doesn’t contain any data worth stealing, 
think again. For example, your personnel records probably contain more 
than enough information for an identity thief: names, addresses, phone 
numbers, Social Security numbers, and so on. Also, your customer files 
may contain your customers’ credit card numbers.
	
✓	Hackers who break into your network may be looking to plant a Trojan 
horse program on your server, enabling them to use your server for 
their own purposes. For example, someone may use your server to send 
thousands of unsolicited spam e-mail messages. The spam won’t be 
traced back to the hackers; it’ll be traced back to you.
	
✓	Not everyone on the network knows enough about how Windows and 
the network work to be trusted with full access to your network’s data 
and systems. A careless mouse click can wipe out a directory of network 
files. One of the best reasons for activating your network’s security fea­
tures is to protect the network from mistakes made by users who don’t 
know what they’re doing.

323
 Chapter 21: Securing Your Network
Two Approaches to Security
When you’re planning how to implement security on your network, first con­
sider which of two basic approaches to security you’ll take:
	
✓	Open door: You grant everyone access to everything by default and 
then place restrictions just on those resources to which you want to 
limit access.
	
✓	Closed door: You begin by denying access to everything and then grant 
specific users access to the specific resources that they need.
In most cases, an open door policy is easier to implement. Typically, only a 
small portion of the data on a network really needs security, such as confi­
dential employee records, or secrets, such as the Coke recipe. The rest of the 
information on a network can be safely made available to everyone who can 
access the network.
If you choose a closed door approach, you set up each user so that he has 
access to nothing. Then, you grant each user access only to those specific 
files or folders that he needs.
A closed door approach results in tighter security but can lead to the Cone 
of Silence Syndrome: Like how Max and the Chief can’t hear each other but 
still talk while they’re under the Cone of Silence, your network users will 
constantly complain that they can’t access the information that they need. 
As a result, you’ll find yourself often adjusting users’ access rights. Choose 
a closed door approach only if your network contains a lot of sensitive 
information, and only if you’re willing to invest time administrating your net­
work’s security policy.
You can think of an open door approach as an entitlement model, in which 
the basic assumption is that users are entitled to network access. In contrast, 
the closed-door policy is a permissions model, in which the basic assumption 
is that users aren’t entitled to anything but must get permissions for every 
network resource that they access.
	
If you’ve never heard of the Cone of Silence, go to YouTube (www.youtube.
com) and search for Cone of Silence. You’ll find several clips from the original 
Get Smart series.
Physical Security: Locking Your Doors
The first level of security in any computer network is physical security. I’m 
amazed when I walk into the reception area of an accounting firm and see an 

324
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
unattended computer sitting on the receptionist’s desk. Often, the reception­
ist has logged on to the system and then walked away from the desk, leaving 
the computer unattended.
Physical security is important for workstations but vital for servers. Any 
good hacker can quickly defeat all but the most paranoid security measures 
if they can gain physical access to a server. To protect the server, follow 
these guidelines:
	
✓	Lock the computer room.
	
✓	Give the key only to people you trust.
	
✓	Keep track of who has the keys.
	
✓	Mount the servers on cases or racks that have locks.
	
✓	Disable the floppy drive on the server.
	
	A common hacking technique is to boot the server from a floppy, thus 
bypassing the security features of the NOS.
	
✓	Keep a trained guard dog in the computer room and feed it only enough 
to keep it hungry and mad. (Just kidding.)
	
There’s a big difference between a door with a lock and a locked door. And 
locks are quite worthless if you don’t use them.
Client computers should be physically secure:
	
✓	Instruct users to not leave their computers unattended while they’re 
logged on.
	
✓	In high-traffic areas (such as the receptionist’s desk), users should 
secure their computers with the keylock, if the computer has one.
	
✓	Users should lock their office doors when they leave.
	
Here are some other threats to physical security that you may not have 
considered:
	
✓	The nightly cleaning crew probably has complete access to your facility. 
How do you know that the person who vacuums your office every night 
doesn’t really work for your chief competitor or doesn’t consider com­
puter hacking to be a sideline hobby? You don’t, so consider the clean­
ing crew to be a threat.
	
✓	What about your trash? Paper shredders aren’t just for Enron accountants. 
Your trash can contain all sorts of useful information: sales reports, 
security logs, printed copies of the company’s security policy, even 
hand-written passwords. For the best security, every piece of paper that 
leaves your building via the trash bin should first go through a shredder.

325
 Chapter 21: Securing Your Network
	
✓	Where do you store your backup tapes? Don’t just stack them up next 
to the server. Not only does that make them easy to steal, it also defeats 
one of the main purposes of backing up your data in the first place: 
securing your server from physical threats, such as fires. If a fire burns 
down your computer room and the backup tapes are sitting unprotected 
next to the server, your company may go out of business and you’ll cer­
tainly be out of a job. Store the backup tapes securely in a fireproof safe 
and keep a copy off-site, too.
	
✓	I’ve seen some networks in which the servers are in a locked computer 
room, but the hubs or switches are in an unsecured closet. Remember 
that every unused port on a hub or a switch represents an open door 
to your network. The hubs and switches should be secured just like the 
servers.
Securing User Accounts
Next to physical security, the careful use of user accounts is the most impor­
tant type of security for your network. Properly configured user accounts can 
prevent unauthorized users from accessing the network, even if they gain 
physical access to the network. The following sections describe some of the 
steps that you can take to strengthen your network’s use of user accounts.
Obfuscating your usernames
Huh? When it comes to security, obfuscation simply means picking obscure 
usernames. For example, most network administrators assign usernames 
based on some combination of the user’s first and last name, such as BarnyM 
or baMiller. However, a hacker can easily guess such a user ID if he or she 
knows the name of at least one employee. After the hacker knows a user­
name, he or she can focus on breaking the password.
You can slow down a hacker by using names that are more obscure. Here are 
some suggestions on how to do that:
	
✓	Add a random three-digit number to the end of the name. For example: 
BarnyM320 or baMiller977.
	
✓	Throw a number or two into the middle of the name. For example: 
Bar6nyM or ba9Miller2.
	
✓	Make sure that usernames are different from e-mail addresses. For exam­
ple, if a user’s e-mail address is baMiller@Mydomain.com, do not use 
baMiller as the user’s account name. Use a more obscure name.

326
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
Do not rely on obfuscation to keep people out of your network! Security by 
obfuscation doesn’t work. A resourceful hacker can discover the most 
obscure names. Obfuscation can slow intruders, not stop them. If you slow 
intruders down, you’re more likely to discover them before they crack your 
network.
Using passwords wisely
One of the most important aspects of network security is the use of passwords.
	
Usernames aren’t usually considered secret. Even if you use obscure names, 
even casual hackers will eventually figure them out.
Passwords, on the other hand, are top secret. Your network password is the 
one thing that keeps an impostor from logging on to the network by using 
your username and therefore receiving the same access rights that you ordi­
narily have. Guard your password with your life.
Here are some tips for creating good passwords:
	
✓	Don’t use obvious passwords, such as your last name, your kid’s name, 
or your dog’s name.
	
✓	Don’t pick passwords based on your hobbies. A friend of mine is a 
boater, and his password is the name of his boat. Anyone who knows 
him can quickly guess his password. Five lashes for naming your pass­
word after your boat.
	
✓	Store your password in your head — not on paper.
	
	Especially bad: Writing your password down on a sticky note and stick­
ing it on your computer’s monitor.
	
✓	Most network operating systems enable you to set an expiration time 
for passwords. For example, you can specify that passwords expire after 
30 days. When a user’s password expires, the user must change it. Your 
users may consider this process a hassle, but it helps to limit the risk 
of someone swiping a password and then trying to break into your com­
puter system later.
	
✓	You can configure user accounts so that when they change passwords, 
they can’t reuse a recent password. For example, you can specify that the 
new password can’t be identical to any of the user’s past three passwords.
	
✓	You can also configure security policies so that passwords must include 
a mixture of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerals, and special 
symbols. Thus, passwords like DIMWIT or DUFUS are out. Passwords 
like 87dIM@wit or duF39&US are in.

327
 Chapter 21: Securing Your Network
	
✓	Some administrators of small networks opt against passwords alto­
gether because they feel that security isn’t an issue on their network. Or 
short of that, they choose obvious passwords, assign every user the 
same password, or print the passwords on giant posters and hang them 
throughout the building. Ignoring basic password security is rarely a 
good idea, even in small networks. You should consider not using pass­
words only if your network is very small (say, two or three computers), 
if you don’t keep sensitive data on a file server, or if the main reason for 
the network is to share access to a printer rather than sharing files. 
(Even if you don’t use passwords, imposing basic security precautions, 
like limiting access that certain users have to certain network directo­
ries, is still possible. Just remember that if passwords aren’t used, noth­
ing prevents a user from signing on by using someone else’s username.)
Generating passwords For Dummies
How do you come up with passwords that no one can guess but that you 
can remember? Most security experts say that the best passwords don’t 
correspond to any words in the English language but consist of a random 
sequence of letters, numbers, and special characters. Yet, how in the heck 
are you supposed to memorize a password like Dks4%DJ2? Especially when 
you have to change it three weeks later to something like 3pQ&X(d8.
	
Here’s a compromise solution that enables you to create passwords that con­
sist of two four-letter words back to back. Take your favorite book (if it’s this 
one, you need to get a life) and turn to any page at random. Find the first four- 
or five-letter word on the page. Suppose that word is When. Then repeat the 
process to find another four- or five-letter word; say you pick the word Most 
the second time. Now combine the words to make your password: WhenMost. 
I think you’ll agree that WhenMost is easier to remember than 3PQ&X(D8 and 
is probably just about as hard to guess. I probably wouldn’t want the folks at 
the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory using this scheme, but it’s good enough 
for most of us.
Here are additional thoughts on concocting passwords from your favorite book:
	
✓	If the words end up being the same, pick another word. And pick different 
words if the combination seems too commonplace, such as WestWind or 
FootBall.
	
✓	For an interesting variation, insert a couple of numerals or special char­
acters between the words. You end up with passwords like into#cat, 
ball3%and, or tree47wing. If you want, use the page number of the 
second word as a separator. For example, if the words are know and 
click and the second word comes from page 435, use know435click.
	
✓	To further confuse your friends and enemies, use medieval passwords 
by picking words from Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. Chaucer is a great 

328
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
source for passwords because he lived before the days of word processors 
with spell-checkers. He wrote seyd instead of said, gret instead of great, 
welk instead of walked, litel instead of little. And he used lots of seven-
letter and eight-letter words suitable for passwords, such as glotenye 
(gluttony), benygne (benign), and opynyoun (opinion). And he got A’s in 
English.
	
✓	If you use any of these password schemes and someone breaks into 
your network, don’t blame me. You’re the one who’s too lazy to memo­
rize D#Sc$h4@bb3xaz5.
	
✓	If you do decide to go with passwords, such as KdI22UR3xdkL, you can 
find random password generators on the Internet. Just go to a search 
engine, such as Google, and search for Password Generator. You’ll find 
Web pages that generate random passwords based on criteria that you 
specify, such as how long the password should be, whether it should 
include letters, numbers, punctuation, uppercase and lowercase letters, 
and so on.
Secure the Administrator account
It stands to reason that at least one network user must have the authority 
to use the network without any of the restrictions imposed on other users. 
This user is the administrator. The administrator is responsible for setting up 
the network’s security system. To do that, the administrator must be exempt 
from all security restrictions.
	
Many networks automatically create an administrator user account when you 
install the network software. The username and password for this initial admin­
istrator are published in the network’s documentation and are the same for all 
networks that use the same network operating system. One of the first things 
that you must do after getting your network up and running is to change the 
password for this standard administrator account. Otherwise, your elaborate 
security precautions are a complete waste of time. Anyone who knows the 
default administrator username and password can access your system with full 
administrator rights and privileges, thus bypassing the security restrictions that 
you so carefully set up.
	
Don’t forget the password for the administrator account! If a network user 
forgets his or her password, you can log on as the supervisor and change that 
user’s password. If you forget the administrator’s password, though, you’re 
stuck.

 Chapter 21: Securing Your Network
Managing User Security
User accounts are the backbone of network security administration. Through 
the use of user accounts, you can determine who can access your network 
as well as what network resources each user can and can’t access. You can 
restrict access to the network to just specific computers or to certain hours 
of the day. In addition, you can lock out users who no longer need to access 
your network. The following sections describe the basics of setting up user 
security for your network.
User accounts
Every user who accesses a network must have a user account. User accounts 
allow the network administrator to determine who can access the network 
and what network resources each user can access. In addition, the user 
account can be customized to provide many convenient features for users, 
such as a personalized Start menu or a display of recently used documents.
Every user account is associated with a username (sometimes called a user 
ID), which the user must enter when logging on to the network. Each account 
also has other information associated with it. In particular:
	
✓	The user’s password: This also includes the password policy, such as 
how often the user has to change his or her password, how complicated 
the password must be, and so on.
	
✓	The user’s contact information: This includes full name, phone number, 
e-mail address, mailing address, and other related information.
	
✓	Account restrictions: This includes restrictions that allow the user to log on 
only during certain times of the day. This feature can restrict your users to 
normal working hours so that they can’t sneak in at 2 a.m. to do unauthor­
ized work. This feature also discourages your users from working overtime 
because they can’t access the network after hours, so use it judiciously. 
You can also specify that the user can log on only at certain computers.
	
✓	Account status: You can temporarily disable a user account so the user 
can’t log on.
	
✓	Home directory: This specifies a shared network folder where the user 
can store documents.
	
✓	Dial-in permissions: These authorize the user to access the network 
remotely via a dialup connection.
	
✓	Group memberships: These grant the user certain rights based on 
groups to which she belongs.
	
	For more information, see the section, “Group therapy,” later in this chapter.

Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
Built-in accounts
Most network operating systems come preconfigured with two built-in 
accounts, Administrator and Guest. In addition, some server services, such 
as web or database servers, create their own user accounts under which to 
run. The following sections describe the characteristics of these accounts.
	
✓	The Administrator account: The Administrator account is the King 
of the Network. This user account isn’t subject to any of the account 
restrictions to which mere mortal accounts must succumb. If you log on 
as the administrator, you can do anything. For this reason, avoid using 
the Administrator account for routine tasks. Log in as the Administrator 
only when you really need to.
	
	Because the Administrator account has unlimited access to your net­
work, it’s imperative that you secure it immediately after you install 
the server. When the NOS Setup program asks for a password for the 
Administrator account, start with a good random mix of uppercase 
and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Don’t pick some easy-to-
remember password to get started, thinking you’ll change it to some­
thing more cryptic later. You’ll forget, and in the meantime, someone 
will break in and reformat the server’s C: drive or steal your customer’s 
credit card numbers.
	
✓	The Guest account: Another commonly created default account is the 
Guest account. This account is set up with a blank password and — if 
any — access rights. The Guest account is designed to allow anyone 
to step up to a computer and log on, but after they do, it then prevents 
them from doing anything. Sounds like a waste of time to me. I suggest 
you disable the Guest account.
	
✓	Service accounts: Some network users aren’t actual people. I don’t mean 
that some of your users are subhuman. Rather, some users are actually 
software processes that require access to secure resources, and there­
fore, require user accounts. These user accounts are usually created 
automatically for you when you install or configure server software.
	
	For example, when you install Microsoft’s web server (IIS), an Internet 
user account called IUSR is created. The complete name for this account 
is IUSR_<servername>. So if the server is named WEB1, the account is 
named IUSR_WEB1. IIS uses this account to allow anonymous Internet 
users to access the files of your website.
	
	Don’t mess with these accounts unless you know what you’re doing. For 
example, if you delete or rename the IUSR account, you must recon­
figure IIS to use the changed account. If you don’t, IIS will deny access 
to anyone trying to reach your site. (Assuming that you do know what 
you’re doing, renaming these accounts can increase your network’s 
security. However, don’t start playing with these accounts until you’ve 
researched the ramifications.)

331
 Chapter 21: Securing Your Network
User rights
User accounts and passwords are the front line of defense in the game of net­
work security. After a user accesses the network by typing a valid user ID and 
password, the second line of security defense — rights — comes into play.
In the harsh realities of network life, all users are created equal, but some 
users are more equal than others. The Preamble to the Declaration of 
Network Independence contains the statement “We hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that some users are endowed by the network administrator with 
certain inalienable rights. . . .”
The rights that you can assign to network users depend on which network 
operating system you use. These are some of the possible user rights for 
Windows servers:
	
✓	Log on locally: The user can log on to the server computer directly from 
the server’s keyboard.
	
✓	Change system time: The user can change the time and date registered 
by the server.
	
✓	Shut down the system: The user can perform an orderly shutdown of 
the server.
	
✓	Back up files and directories: The user can perform a backup of files 
and directories on the server.
Network rights we want to see
The network rights allowed by most NOSes are 
pretty boring. Here are a few rights I wish would 
be allowed:
	✓	Cheat: Provides a special option that enables 
you to see what cards the other players are 
holding when you’re playing Hearts.
	✓	Spy: Eavesdrops on other users’ Internet 
sessions so you can find out what websites 
they’re viewing.
	✓	Grumble: Automatically sends e-mail mes­
sages to other users that explain how busy, 
tired, or upset you are.
	✓	Set pay: Grants you special access to the 
payroll system so that you can give yourself 
a pay raise.
	✓	Sue: In America, everyone has the right to 
sue. So this right should be granted auto­
matically to all users.
	✓	Fire: Wouldn’t it be great if the network 
could grant you the right to play Donald 
Trump and fire your annoying co-workers?

332
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
✓	Restore files and directories: The user can restore backed-up files.
	
✓	Take ownership of files and other objects: The user can take over files 
and other network resources that belong to other users.
NetWare has a similar set of user rights.
Permissions (who gets what)
User rights control what a user can do on a network-wide basis. Permissions 
enable you to fine-tune your network security by controlling access to spe­
cific network resources, such as files or printers, for individual users or 
groups. For example, you can set up permissions to allow users into the 
accounting department to access files in the server’s \ACCTG directory. 
Permissions can also enable some users to read certain files but not modify 
or delete them.
Each network operating system manages permissions in a different way. 
Whatever the details, the effect is that you can give permission to each user 
to access certain files, folders, or drives in certain ways. For example, you 
might grant a user full access to some files but grant read-only access to 
other files.
	
Any permissions you specify for a folder apply automatically to any of that 
folder’s subfolders, unless you explicitly specify different permissions for the 
subfolder.
	
You can use Windows permissions only for files or folders that are created 
on drives formatted as NTFS or ReFS volumes. If you insist on using FAT or 
FAT32 for your Windows shared drives, you can’t protect individual files or 
folders on the drives. This is one of the main reasons for using NTFS for your 
Windows servers.
Group therapy
A group account is an account that doesn’t represent an individual user. Instead, 
it represents a group of users who use the network in a similar way. Instead 
of granting access rights to each of these users individually, you can grant the 
rights to the group and then assign individual users to the group. When you 
assign a user to a group, that user inherits the rights specified for the group.
For example, suppose that you create a group named Accounting for the 
accounting staff and then allow members of the Accounting group access to 
the network’s accounting files and applications. Then, instead of granting 
each accounting user access to those files and applications, you simply make 
each accounting user a member of the Accounting group.

333
 Chapter 21: Securing Your Network
Here are a few additional details about groups:
	
✓	Groups are one of the keys to network management nirvana. As much 
as possible, avoid managing network users individually. Instead, clump 
them into groups and manage the groups. When all 50 users in the 
accounting department need access to a new file share, would you 
rather update 50 user accounts or just 1 group account?
	
✓	A user can belong to more than one group. Then, the user inherits 
the rights of each group. For example, you can have groups set up for 
Accounting, Sales, Marketing, and Finance. A user who needs to access 
both Accounting and Finance information can be made a member of both 
groups. Likewise, a user who needs access to both Sales and Marketing 
information can be made a member of both the Sales and Marketing groups.
	
✓	You can grant or revoke specific rights to individual users to override 
the group settings. For example, you may grant a few extra permissions 
for the manager of the accounting department. You may also impose a 
few extra restrictions on certain users.
User profiles
User profiles are a Windows feature that keeps track of an individual user’s 
preferences for his or her Windows configuration. For a non-networked com­
puter, profiles enable two or more users to use the same computer, each 
with his or her own desktop settings, such as wallpaper, colors, Start menu 
options, and so on.
The real benefit of user profiles becomes apparent when profiles are used on 
a network. A user’s profile can be stored on a server computer and accessed 
whenever that user logs on to the network from any Windows computer on 
the network.
The following are some of the elements of Windows that are governed by set­
tings in the user profile:
	
✓	Desktop settings from the Display Properties dialog box, including wall­
paper, screen savers, and color schemes
	
✓	Start menu programs and Windows toolbar options
	
✓	Favorites, which provide easy access to the files and folders that the 
user accesses often
	
✓	Network settings, including drive mappings, network printers, and 
recently visited network locations
	
✓	Application settings, such as option settings for Microsoft Word
	
✓	The My Documents folder

334
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
Logon scripts
A logon script is a batch file that runs automatically whenever a user logs on. 
Logon scripts can perform several important logon tasks for you, such as 
mapping network drives, starting applications, synchronizing the client com­
puter’s time-of-day clock, and so on. Logon scripts reside on the server. Each 
user account can specify whether to use a logon script and which script to use.
This sample logon script maps a few network drives and synchronizes the time:
net use m: \\MYSERVER\Acct
net use n: \\MYSERVER\Admin
net use o: \\MYSERVER\Dev
net time \\MYSERVER /set /yes
Logon scripts are a little out of vogue because most of what a logon script does 
can be done via user profiles. Still, many administrators prefer the simplicity 
of logon scripts, so they’re still used even on Windows 2012 Server systems.
Securing Your Users
Security techniques, such as physical security, user account security, server 
security, and locking down your servers are child’s play compared with the 
most difficult job of network security: securing your network’s users. All the 
best-laid security plans will go for naught if your users write their passwords 
on sticky notes and post them on their computers.
The key to securing your network users is to create a written network secu­
rity policy and to stick to it. Have a meeting with everyone to go over the 
security policy to make sure that everyone understands the rules. Also, make 
sure to have consequences when violations occur.
Here are some suggestions for some basic security rules that can be incorpo­
rated into your security policy:
	
✓	Never write down your password or give it to someone else.
	
✓	Accounts shouldn’t be shared. Never use someone else’s account to 
access a resource that you can’t access under your own account. If you 
need access to some network resource that isn’t available to you, for­
mally request access under your own account.

335
 Chapter 21: Securing Your Network
	
✓	Likewise, never give your account information to a co-worker so that he 
or she can access a needed resource. Your co-worker should instead for­
mally request access under his or her own account.
	
✓	Don’t install any software or hardware on your computer without first 
obtaining permission. This especially includes wireless access devices 
or modems.
	
✓	Don’t enable file and printer sharing on workstations without first getting 
permission.
	
✓	Never attempt to disable or bypass the network’s security features.

f your network is connected to the Internet, a whole host of security 
issues bubble to the surface. You probably connected your network 
to the Internet so that your network’s users could get out to the Internet. 
Unfortunately, however, your Internet connection is a two-way street. Not 
only does it enable your network’s users to step outside the bounds of your 
network to access the Internet, but it also enables others to step in and 
access your network.
And step in they will. The world is filled with hackers who are looking for 
networks like yours to break into. They may do it just for the fun of it, or 
they may do it to steal your customer’s credit card numbers or to coerce 
your mail server into sending thousands of spam messages on their behalf. 
Whatever their motive, rest assured that your network will be broken into if 
you leave it unprotected.
This chapter presents an overview of three basic techniques for securing your 
network’s Internet connection: controlling access via a firewall, detecting 
viruses with antivirus software, and fixing security flaws with software patches.
Firewalls
A firewall is a security-conscious router that sits between the Internet and 
your network with a single-minded task: preventing them from getting to us. 
The firewall acts as a security guard between the Internet and your local area 
network (LAN). All network traffic into and out of the LAN must pass through 
the firewall, which prevents unauthorized access to the network.

338
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
Some type of firewall is a must-have if your network has a connection to the 
Internet, whether that connection is broadband (cable modem or DSL), T1, or 
some other high-speed connection. Without it, sooner or later a hacker will 
discover your unprotected network and tell his friends about it. Within a few 
hours your network will be toast.
You can set up a firewall using two basic ways. The easiest way is to pur­
chase a firewall appliance, which is basically a self-contained router with 
built-in firewall features. Most firewall appliances include a web-based inter­
face that enables you to connect to the firewall from any computer on your 
network using a browser. You can then customize the firewall settings to suit 
your needs.
Alternatively, you can set up a server computer to function as a firewall com­
puter. The server can run just about any network operating system, but most 
dedicated firewall systems run Linux.
Whether you use a firewall appliance or a firewall computer, the firewall must 
be located between your network and the Internet, as shown in Figure 22-1. 
Here, one end of the firewall is connected to a network hub, which is, in turn, 
connected to the other computers on the network. The other end of the fire­
wall is connected to the Internet. As a result, all traffic from the LAN to the 
Internet and vice versa must travel through the firewall.

 Chapter 22: Hardening Your Network
The term perimeter is sometimes used to describe the location of a firewall 
on your network. In short, a firewall is like a perimeter fence that completely 
surrounds your property and forces all visitors to enter through the front gate.
	
In large networks — especially campus-wide or even metropolitan networks — 
it’s sometimes hard to figure out exactly where the perimeter is located. If 
your network has two or more wide area network (WAN) connections, make 
sure that every one of those connections connects to a firewall and not 
directly to the network. You can do this by providing a separate firewall for 
each WAN connection or by using a firewall with more than one WAN port.
The Many Types of Firewalls
Firewalls employ four basic techniques to keep unwelcome visitors out of 
your network. The following sections describe these basic firewall techniques.
Packet filtering
A packet-filtering firewall examines each packet that crosses the firewall and 
tests the packet according to a set of rules that you set up. If the packet 
passes the test, it’s allowed to pass. If the packet doesn’t pass, it’s rejected.
Packet filters are the least expensive type of firewall. As a result, packet-filtering 
firewalls are very common. However, packet filtering has a number of flaws 
that knowledgeable hackers can exploit. As a result, packet filtering by itself 
doesn’t make for a fully effective firewall.
Packet filters work by inspecting the source and destination IP and port 
addresses contained in each TCP/IP packet. TCP/IP ports are numbers that 
are assigned to specific services that help to identify for which service each 
packet is intended. For example, the port number for the HTTP protocol is 80. 
As a result, any incoming packets headed for an HTTP server will specify 
port 80 as the destination port.
Port numbers are often specified with a colon following an IP address. For 
example, the HTTP service on a server whose IP address is 192.168.10.133 
would be 192.168.10.133:80.
Literally thousands of established ports are in use. Table 22-1 lists a few of 
the most popular ports.

NetWare over IP
443
HTTP over TLS/SSL (HTTPS)
The rules that you set up for the packet filter either permit or deny packets 
that specify certain IP addresses or ports. For example, you may permit pack­
ets that are intended for your mail server or your web server and deny all 
other packets. Or, you may set up a rule that specifically denies packets that 
are heading for the ports used by NetBIOS. This rule keeps Internet hackers 
from trying to access NetBIOS server resources, such as files or printers.
One of the biggest weaknesses of packet filtering is that it pretty much trusts 
that the packets themselves are telling the truth when they say who they’re 
from and who they’re going to. Hackers exploit this weakness by using a 
hacking technique called IP spoofing, in which they insert fake IP addresses in 
packets that they send to your network.
Another weakness of packet filtering is that it examines each packet in isolation, 
without considering what packets have gone through the firewall before and 
what packets may follow. In other words, packet filtering is stateless. Rest 

341
 Chapter 22: Hardening Your Network
assured that hackers have figured out how to exploit the stateless nature of 
packet filtering to get through firewalls.
In spite of these weaknesses, packet filter firewalls have several advantages 
that explain why they’re commonly used:
	
✓	Packet filters are very efficient. They hold up each inbound and out­
bound packet for only a few milliseconds while they look inside the 
packet to determine the destination and source ports and addresses. 
After these addresses and ports have been determined, the packet filter 
quickly applies its rules and either sends the packet along or rejects it. 
In contrast, other firewall techniques have a more noticeable perfor­
mance overhead.
	
✓	Packet filters are almost completely transparent to users. The only 
time a user will be aware that a packet filter firewall is being used is 
when the firewall rejects packets. Other firewall techniques require that 
clients and/or servers be specially configured to work with the firewall.
	
✓	Packet filters are inexpensive. Most routers include built-in packet 
filtering.
Stateful packet inspection (SPI)
Stateful packet inspection (SPI), is a step up in intelligence from simple packet 
filtering. A firewall with SPI looks at packets in groups rather than individu­
ally. It keeps track of which packets have passed through the firewall and can 
detect patterns that indicate unauthorized access. In some cases, the firewall 
may hold on to packets as they arrive until the firewall has gathered enough 
information to make a decision about whether the packets should be autho­
rized or rejected.
	
Stateful packet inspection was once found only on expensive, enterprise-level 
routers. Now, however, SPI firewalls are affordable enough for small- or medium-
sized networks to use.
Circuit-level gateway
A circuit-level gateway manages connections between clients and servers based 
on TCP/IP addresses and port numbers. After the connection is established, 
the gateway doesn’t interfere with packets flowing between the systems.

342
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
For example, you could use a Telnet circuit-level gateway to allow Telnet 
connections (port 23) to a particular server and prohibit other types of con­
nections to that server. After the connection is established, the circuit-level 
gateway allows packets to flow freely over the connection. As a result, the 
circuit-level gateway can’t prevent a Telnet user from running specific programs 
or using specific commands.
Application gateway
An application gateway is a firewall system that’s more intelligent than a 
packet-filtering, stateful packet inspection, or circuit-level gateway firewall. 
Packet filters treat all TCP/IP packets the same. In contrast, application gate­
ways know the details about the applications that generate the packets that 
pass through the firewall. For example, a Web application gateway is aware 
of the details of HTTP packets. As a result, it can examine more than just the 
source and destination addresses and ports to determine whether the packets 
should be allowed to pass through the firewall.
In addition, application gateways work as proxy servers. Simply put, a proxy 
server is a server that sits between a client computer and a real server. The 
proxy server intercepts packets that are intended for the real server and pro­
cesses them. The proxy server can examine the packet and decide to pass it 
on to the real server, or it can reject the packet. Or the proxy server may be 
able to respond to the packet itself, without involving the real server at all.
For example, web proxies often store copies of commonly used web pages in 
a local cache. When a user requests a web page from a remote web server, 
the proxy server intercepts the request and checks to see whether it already 
has a copy of the page in its cache. If so, the web proxy returns the page 
directly to the user. If not, the proxy passes the request on to the real server.
Application gateways are aware of the details of how various types of TCP/IP 
servers handle sequences of TCP/IP packets, so they can make more intelli­
gent decisions about whether an incoming packet is legitimate or is part of an 
attack. As a result, application gateways are more secure than simple packet-
filtering firewalls, which can deal with only one packet at a time.
The improved security of application gateways, however, comes at a price. 
Application gateways are more expensive than packet filters, both in terms of 
their purchase price and in the cost of configuring and maintaining them. In 
addition, application gateways slow down the network performance because 
they do more detailed checking of packets before allowing them to pass.

343
 Chapter 22: Hardening Your Network
The Built-In Windows Firewall
All versions of Windows since Windows XP come with a built-in packet-filtering 
firewall. If you don’t have a separate firewall router, you can use this built-in 
firewall to provide a basic level of protection. See Chapter 8 for the steps to 
follow to configure the Windows Firewall.
	
Do not enable the Windows Firewall if you’re using a separate firewall router 
to protect your network. Because the other computers on the network are 
connected directly to the router and not to your computer, the firewall won’t 
protect the rest of the network. Additionally, as an unwanted side effect, the 
rest of the network will lose the ability to access your computer.
Virus Protection
Viruses are one of the most misunderstood computer phenomena around 
these days. What is a virus? How does it work? How does it spread from 
computer to computer? I’m glad you asked.
What is a virus?
Make no mistake — viruses are real. Now that most people are connected to 
the Internet, viruses have really taken off. Every computer user is susceptible 
to attacks by computer viruses, and using a network increases your vulner­
ability because it exposes all network users to the risk of being infected by a 
virus that lands on any one network user’s computer.
Viruses don’t just spontaneously appear out of nowhere. Viruses are computer 
programs that are created by malicious programmers who’ve lost a few screws 
and should be locked up.
What makes a virus a virus is its capability to make copies of itself that can 
be spread to other computers. These copies, in turn, make still more copies 
that spread to still more computers, and so on, ad nauseam.
Then, the virus waits patiently until something triggers it — perhaps when 
you type a particular command or press a certain key, when a certain date 
arrives, or when the virus creator sends the virus a message. What the virus 
does when it strikes also depends on what the virus creator wants the virus 
to do. Some viruses harmlessly display a “gotcha” message. Some send e-mail 

344
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
to everyone it finds in your address book. Some wipe out all the data on your 
hard drive. Ouch.
A few years back, viruses moved from one computer to another by latching 
themselves onto floppy disks. Whenever you borrowed a floppy disk from a 
buddy, you ran the risk of infecting your own computer with a virus that may 
have stowed away on the disk.
Nowadays, virus programmers have discovered that e-mail is a much more 
efficient method to spread their viruses. Typically, a virus masquerades as a 
useful or interesting e-mail attachment, such as instructions on how to make 
$1,000,000 in your spare time, pictures of naked celebrities, or a Valentine’s 
Day greeting from your long-lost sweetheart. When a curious but unsuspect­
ing user double-clicks the attachment, the virus springs to life, copying itself 
onto the user’s computer and, in some cases, sending copies of itself to all 
the names in the user’s address book.
After the virus has worked its way onto a networked computer, the virus can 
then figure out how to spread itself to other computers on the network.
Here are some more tidbits about protecting your network from virus attacks:
	
✓	The term virus is often used to refer not only to true virus programs 
(which can replicate themselves) but also to any other type of program 
that’s designed to harm your computer. These programs include so-
called Trojan horse programs that usually look like games but are, in 
reality, hard drive formatters.
	
✓	A worm is similar to a virus, but it doesn’t actually infect other files. 
Instead, it just copies itself onto other computers on a network. After 
a worm has copied itself onto your computer, there’s no telling what it 
may do there. For example, a worm may scan your hard drive for inter­
esting information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, and then 
e-mail them to the worm’s author.
	
✓	Computer virus experts have identified several thousand “strains” of 
viruses. Many of them have colorful names, such as the I Love You virus, 
the Stoned virus, and the Michelangelo virus.
	
✓	Antivirus programs can recognize known viruses and remove them from 
your system, and they can spot the telltale signs of unknown viruses. 
Unfortunately, the idiots who write viruses aren’t idiots (in the intellec­
tual sense), so they’re constantly developing new techniques to evade 
detection by antivirus programs. New viruses are frequently discovered, 
and antivirus programs are periodically updated to detect and remove 
them.

 Chapter 22: Hardening Your Network
Antivirus programs
The best way to protect your network from virus infection is to use an antivirus 
program. These programs have a catalog of several thousand known viruses 
that they can detect and remove. In addition, they can spot the types of changes 
that viruses typically make to your computer’s files, thus decreasing the like­
lihood that some previously unknown virus will go undetected.
Although Windows doesn’t come with built-in antivirus software, you can 
download an excellent free antivirus solution from Microsoft called Microsoft 
Security Essentials. Popular alternatives to Microsoft’s free product include 
Norton AntiVirus, Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus, and Kapersky Antivirus.
The people who make antivirus programs have their fingers on the pulse of 
the virus world and often release updates to their software to combat the 
latest viruses. Because virus writers are constantly developing new viruses, 
your antivirus software is next to worthless unless you keep it up-to-date by 
downloading the latest updates.
The following are several approaches to deploying antivirus protection on 
your network:
	
✓	You can install antivirus software on each network user’s computer. 
This technique would be the most effective if you could count on all 
your users to keep their antivirus software up-to-date. Because that’s an 
unlikely proposition, you may want to adopt a more reliable approach to 
virus protection.
	
✓	Managed antivirus services place antivirus client software on each client 
computer in your network. Then, an antivirus server automatically updates 
the clients on a regular basis to make sure that they’re kept up to date.
	
✓	Server-based antivirus software protects your network servers from 
viruses. For example, you can install antivirus software on your mail 
server to scan all incoming mail for viruses and remove them before 
your network users ever see them.
	
✓	Some firewall appliances include antivirus enforcement checks that don’t 
allow your users to access the Internet unless their antivirus software is 
up to date. This type of firewall provides the best antivirus protection 
available.

Safe computing
Besides using an antivirus program, you can take a few additional precautions 
to ensure virus-free computing. If you haven’t talked to your kids about these 
safe-computing practices, you had better do so soon.
	
✓	Regularly back up your data. If a virus hits you and your antivirus software 
can’t repair the damage, you may need the backup to recover your data. 
Make sure that you restore from a backup that was created before you 
were infected by the virus!
	
✓	If you buy software from a store and discover that the seal has been 
broken on the disk package, take the software back. Don’t try to install 
it on your computer. You don’t hear about tainted software as often as 
you hear about tainted beef, but if you buy software that’s been opened, 
it may well be laced with a virus infection.
	
✓	Use your antivirus software to scan your disk for virus infection after 
your computer has been to a repair shop or worked on by a consultant. 
These guys don’t intend harm, but they occasionally spread viruses 
accidentally, simply because they work on so many strange computers.
	
✓	Don’t open e-mail attachments from people you don’t know or attachments 
you weren’t expecting.
	
✓	Use your antivirus software to scan any CD-ROM or flash drive that 
doesn’t belong to you before you access any of its files.
Patching Things Up
One of the annoyances that every network manager faces is applying software 
patches to keep the operating system and other software up to date. A soft­
ware patch is a minor update that fixes the small glitches that crop up from 
time to time, such as minor security or performance issues. These glitches 
aren’t significant enough to merit a new version of the software, but they’re 
important enough to require fixing. Most of the patches correct security 
flaws that computer hackers have uncovered in their relentless attempts to 
prove that they are smarter than the security programmers at Microsoft.
Periodically, all the recently released patches are combined into a service 
pack. Although the most diligent network administrators apply all patches 
when they’re released, many administrators just wait for the service packs:

347
 Chapter 22: Hardening Your Network
	
✓	For all versions of Windows, you can use the Windows Update website 
to apply patches to keep your operating system and other Microsoft 
software up to date. Windows Update scans your computer’s software 
and creates a list of software patches and other components that you 
can download and install. To use Windows Update, open the Control 
Panel, click System and Security, and then click Windows Update.
	
✓	You can configure Windows Update to automatically notify you of 
updates so you don’t have to remember to check for new patches.
	
✓	You can subscribe to a service that automatically sends you e-mail to let 
you know of new patches and updates.
	
Keeping a large network patched can be one of the major challenges of network 
administration. If you have more than a few dozen computers on your network, 
consider investing in server-based software that’s designed to simplify the 
process. For example, Lumension (www.lumension.com) is a server-based 
program that collects software patches from a variety of manufacturers and 
lets you create distributions that are automatically pushed out to client com­
puters. With software like Lumension, you don’t have to rely on end users 
to download and install patches, and you don’t have to visit each computer 
individually to install patches.

Network Performance Anxiety
In This Chapter

▶	Looking at bottlenecks
▶	Developing a procedure for solving performance problems
▶	Monitoring performance
▶	Implementing other tips for speeding up your network
T

he term network performance refers to how efficiently the network responds 
to users’ needs. Obviously, any access to resources that involves the 
network is slower than similar access that doesn’t involve the network. For 
example, opening a Word document that resides on a network file server takes 
longer than opening a similar document that resides on the user’s local hard 
drive. However, it shouldn’t take much longer. If it does, you have a network 
performance problem.
This chapter is a general introduction to the practice of tuning your network 
so that it performs as well as possible. Keep in mind that many specific bits 
of network tuning advice are scattered throughout this book. In this chapter, 
you can find some specific techniques for analyzing your network’s perfor­
mance, taking corrective action when a performance problem develops, and 
charting your progress.
Why Administrators Hate 
Performance Problems
Network performance problems are among the most difficult network problems 
to track down and solve. If a user simply can’t access the network, it usually 
doesn’t take long to figure out why: The cable is unplugged, a network card is 
malfunctioning, or the user doesn’t have permission to access the resource, 
for example. After you do a little investigating, the problem usually reveals 
itself, and you fix it and move on to the next problem.

350
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
Unfortunately, performance problems are messier. Here are just a few rea­
sons that network administrators hate performance problems:
	
✓	Performance problems are difficult to quantify. Exactly how much 
slower is the network now than it was a week ago, a month ago, or even 
a year ago? Sometimes the network just feels slow, but you can’t quite 
define exactly how slow it really is.
	
✓	Performance problems usually develop gradually. Sometimes a network 
slows down suddenly and drastically. More often, though, the network 
gradually gets slower, a little bit at a time, until one day its users notice 
that the network is slow.
	
✓	Performance problems often go unreported. Users gripe about the 
problem to each other around the water cooler, but they don’t formally 
contact you to let you know that the network seems 10 percent slower 
than usual. As long as they can still access the network, they just assume 
that the problem is temporary or that they’re imagining a problem.
	
✓	Many performance problems are intermittent. Sometimes a user calls 
you and complains that a certain network operation has become slower 
than molasses, and by the time you get to that person’s desk, the operation 
performs in a snap. Sometimes you can find a pattern to the intermittent 
behavior, such as it’s slower in the morning than in the afternoon or it’s 
slow only while backups are running or while the printer is working. At 
other times, you can’t find a pattern: Sometimes the operation is slow, 
and sometimes it isn’t.
	
✓	Performance tuning isn’t an exact science. Improving performance 
sometimes involves educated guesswork. Will upgrading all users from 
100 Mbps to 1 Gbps improve performance? Probably. Will segmenting 
the network improve performance? Maybe. Will adding another 8GB of 
RAM to the server improve performance? Hopefully.
	
✓	The solution to a performance problem is sometimes a hard sell. If a 
user can’t access the network because of a malfunctioning component, 
the purchase of a replacement is usually undeniably justified. However, 
if the network is slow and you think that you can fix it by upgrading the 
entire network to Gigabit Ethernet, you may have trouble selling man­
agement on the upgrade.
What Exactly Is a Bottleneck?
The term bottleneck doesn’t refer in any way to the physique of the typical 
computer geek. Rather, computer geeks coined the phrase when they discov­
ered that the tapered shape of a bottle of Jolt cola limited the rate at which 
they could consume the beverage. “Hey,” a computer geek said one day, “the 
gently tapered narrowness of this bottle’s neck imposes a distinct limiting 
effect upon the rate at which I can consume the tasty caffeine-laden beverage 

351
 Chapter 23: Network Performance Anxiety
contained within. This observation draws to mind a hitherto undiscovered 
yet obvious analogy to the limiting effect that a single slow component of a 
computer system can have upon the performance of the system as a whole.”
“Fascinating,” replied all the other computer geeks, who were fortunate 
enough to be present at that historic moment.
The term stuck and is used to this day to draw attention to the simple fact that 
a computer system is only as fast as its slowest component. It’s the computer 
equivalent of the old truism that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
For a simple demonstration of this concept, consider what happens when you 
print a word-processing document on a slow printer. Your word-processing 
program reads the data from disk and sends it to the printer. Then you sit and 
wait while the printer prints the document.
Would buying a faster CPU or adding more memory make the document 
print faster? No. The CPU is already much faster than the printer, and your 
computer already has more than enough memory to print the document. The 
printer itself is the bottleneck, so the only way to print the document faster is 
to replace the slow printer with a faster one.
Here are some other, random thoughts about bottlenecks:
	
✓	A computer system always has a bottleneck. Suppose that you decide 
that the bottleneck on your file server is a slow 10,000 RPM SCSI disk 
drive, so you replace it with a fast 15,000 RPM drive. Now the hard drive 
is no longer the bottleneck: The drive can process information faster 
than the controller card to which the disk is connected. You didn’t really 
eliminate the bottleneck — you just moved it from the hard drive to the 
disk controller. No matter what you do, the computer will always have a 
component that limits the overall performance of the system.
	
✓	One way to limit the effect of a bottleneck is to avoid waiting for the 
bottleneck. For example, print spooling lets you avoid waiting for a slow 
printer. Although spooling doesn’t speed up the printer, it frees you to 
do other work while the printer chugs along. Similarly, disk caching lets 
you avoid waiting for a slow hard drive.
The Five Most Common 
Network Bottlenecks
Direct from the home office in sunny Fresno, California, here are the top five 
most common network bottlenecks, in no particular order.

352
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
The hardware inside your servers
Your servers should be powerful computers capable of handling all the work 
your network will throw at them. Don’t cut corners by using a bottom-of-the-
line computer that you bought at a discount computer store.
The following list describes the four most important components of your 
server hardware:
	
✓	Processor: Your server should have a powerful processor. Any processor 
that’s available in a $500 computer from a low-cost general appliance 
store is generally not a processor that you want to see in your file server. 
In other words, avoid processors designed for consumer-grade home 
computers.
	
✓	Memory: You can’t have too much memory. Memory is cheap, so don’t 
skimp. Don’t even think about running a server with fewer than 4GB 
of RAM.
	
✓	Disk: Don’t mess around with inexpensive IDE hard drives. To have a 
respectable system, you should have nothing but SCSI or SAS (Serially 
Attached SCSI) drives.
	
✓	Network interface: A $9.95 network card may be fine for your home 
network, but don’t use one in a file server that supports 100 users and 
expect to be happy with the server’s performance. Remember that the 
server computer uses the network more often than any clients do. Make 
sure your servers are equipped with good high-speed network interfaces.
The server’s configuration options
All network operating systems (NOSes) have options that you can configure. 
Some of these options can make the difference between a pokey network and 
a zippy network. Unfortunately, no hard-and-fast rules exist for setting these 
options. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have options.
The following important tuning options are available for most servers:
	
✓	Virtual memory options: Virtual memory refers to disk paging files that 
the server uses when it doesn’t have enough real memory to do its work. 
Few servers ever have enough real memory, so virtual memory is always 
an important server feature. You can specify the size and location of the 
virtual memory paging files.
	
	For the best performance, provide at least as much virtual memory as 
your computer has real memory. For example, if your server has 16GB of 
real memory, allocate at least 16GB of virtual memory. If necessary, you 
can increase this size later.

353
 Chapter 23: Network Performance Anxiety
	
✓	Disk striping: Use the disk defragmenter to optimize the data storage on 
your server’s disks.
	
	If the server has more than one hard drive, you can increase perfor­
mance by creating striped volumes, which allow disk I/O operations to 
run concurrently on each of the drives in the stripe set.
	
✓	Network protocols: Make sure that your network protocols are config­
ured correctly and remove any protocols that aren’t necessary.
	
✓	Free disk space on the server: Servers like to have plenty of breathing 
room on their disks.
	
	If the amount of free disk space on your server drops precipitously low, 
the server chokes up and slows to a crawl. Make sure that your server 
has plenty of space — a few gigabytes of unused disk space provides a 
healthy buffer.
Servers that do too much
One common source of network performance problems is a server over­
loaded with too many duties. Just because a modern network operating 
system comes equipped with dozens of different types of services doesn’t 
mean that you should enable and use them all on a single server. If a single 
server is bogged down because of too much work, add a second server to 
relieve the first server of some of its chores. Remember the old saying: “Many 
hands make light work.”
For example, if your network needs more disk space, consider adding a 
second file server rather than adding another drive to the server that already 
has four nearly full drives. Better yet, purchase a file server appliance dedi­
cated to the task of serving files.
As a side benefit, your network will be easier to administer and more reliable 
if you place separate functions on separate servers. For example, if a single 
server doubles as a file server and a mail server, you lose both services if you 
have to take down the server to perform an upgrade or repair a failed compo­
nent. However, if you have separate file and mail server computers, only one 
of the services is interrupted if you have to take down one of the servers.
The network infrastructure
The infrastructure consists of the cables and any switches, hubs, routers, 
and other components that sit between your clients and your servers.

354
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
	
The following network infrastructure items can slow down your network:
	
✓	Hubs: If you have old network hubs rather than switches, replace them 
immediately. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.
	
✓	Segment sizes: Keep the number of computers and other devices on 
each network segment to a reasonable number. About 20 devices is usu­
ally the right number. (Note that if you replace your hubs with switches, 
you instantly cut the size of each segment because each port on a switch 
constitutes a separate segment.)
	
✓	The network’s speed: If you have a really old network, you may discover 
that many — if not all — of your users are still working at 10 Mbps. 
Upgrading to 100 Mbps speeds up the network dramatically. Upgrading 
to 1 Gbps speeds it up even more.
	
✓	The backbone speed: If your network uses a backbone to connect seg­
ments, consider upgrading the backbone to 1 Gbps.
	
The hardest part about improving the performance of a network is determin­
ing where the bottlenecks are. With sophisticated test equipment and years 
of experience, network gurus can make good educated guesses. Without the 
equipment and experience, you can still make good uneducated guesses.
Malfunctioning components
Sometimes a malfunctioning network card or other component slows down 
the network. For example, a switch may malfunction intermittently, occasion­
ally letting packets through but dropping enough of them to slow down the 
network. After you identify the faulty component, replacing it restores the 
network to its original speed.
Tune Your Network the Compulsive Way
You can tune your network in one of two ways. The first is to think about it 
a bit, take a guess at an approach that may improve performance, try that 
approach, and see whether the network seems to run faster. This strategy is 
the way most people go about tuning the network.
You can also try the compulsive way, which is suitable for people who orga­
nize their sock drawers by color and their food cupboards alphabetically by 
food group. The compulsive approach to tuning a network goes something 
like this:

355
 Chapter 23: Network Performance Anxiety
	
1.	 Establish a method for objectively testing the performance of some 
aspect of the network.
	
	 In this method, you create a benchmark. The result of your benchmark is 
a baseline.
	
2.	 Change one variable of your network configuration and rerun the test.
	
	 For example, you may think that increasing the size of the disk cache 
can improve performance. Change the cache size, restart the server, and 
run the benchmark test. Note whether performance improves, stays the 
same, or becomes worse.
	
3.	 Repeat Step 2 for each variable that you want to test.
Here are some salient points to keep in mind if you decide to tune your net­
work the compulsive way:
	
✓	If possible, test each variable separately. In other words, before proceed­
ing, reverse the changes you made to other network variables.
	
✓	Write down the results of each test so that you have an accurate record 
of the effect that each change makes on your network’s performance.
	
✓	Be sure to change only one aspect of the network each time you run 
the benchmark. If you make several changes, you don’t know which one 
caused the change. One change may improve performance, but the 
other change may worsen performance so that the changes cancel each 
other out — kind of like offsetting penalties in a football game.
	
✓	If possible, conduct the baseline test during normal working hours, 
when the network is undergoing its normal workload.
	
✓	To establish the network’s baseline performance, run the benchmark 
test two or three times to make sure that the results are repeatable.
Monitoring Network Performance
One way to monitor network performance is to use a stopwatch to see how 
long it actually takes to complete common network tasks, such as opening 
documents or printing reports. If you choose to monitor your network by 
using the stopwatch technique, you’ll want to get a clipboard, baseball cap, 
and gray sweat suit to complete the ensemble.
A more high-tech approach to monitoring network performance is to use a 
monitor program that automatically gathers network statistics for you. After 

356
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
you set up the monitor, it plugs away, silently spying on your network and 
recording what it sees in performance logs. You can then review the perfor­
mance logs to see how your network is doing.
For large networks, you can purchase sophisticated monitoring programs that 
run on their own dedicated servers. For small- and medium-sized networks, 
you can probably get by with the built-in monitoring facilities that come with 
the network operating system. For example, Figure 23-1 shows the Performance 
Monitor tool that comes with Windows Server 2012. Other operating systems 
come with similar tools.
	
Figure 23-1: 
Monitoring 
performance.
	
Windows Performance Monitor lets you keep track of several different 
aspects of system performance at once. You track each performance aspect 
by setting up a counter. You can choose from dozens of different counters. 
Table 23-1 describes some of the most commonly used counters. Note that 
each counter refers to a server object, such as physical disk, memory, or the 
processor.

357
 Chapter 23: Network Performance Anxiety
Table 23-1	
Commonly Used Performance Counters
Object
Counter
Description
Physical Disk
% Free Space
Percentage of free space on the server’s 
physical disks. Should be at least 15%.
Physical Disk 
Length
Average 
Queue 
Indicates how many disk operations are 
waiting while the disk is busy servicing other 
disk operations. Should be two or fewer.
Memory

cal threshold is about 2,500 pps.
Processor
% Processor 
Time
Indicates the percentage of the processor’s 
time that it’s busy doing work rather than sit­
ting idle. Should be 85% or less.
Here are a few more things to consider about performance monitoring:
	
✓	Performance Monitor enables you to view real-time data or to view 
data that you can save in a log file. Real-time data gives you an idea 
about what’s happening with the network at a particular moment, but 
the more useful information comes from the logs.
	
✓	You can schedule logging to occur at certain times of the day and for 
certain intervals. For example, you may schedule the log to gather data 
every 15 seconds from 9:00 to 9:30 every morning and then again from 
3:00 to 3:30 every afternoon.
	
✓	Even if you don’t have a performance problem now, you should set up 
performance logging and let it run for a few weeks to gather baseline 
data. If you develop a problem, this baseline data will prove invaluable 
while you research the problem.
	
✓	Don’t leave performance logging turned on all the time. Gathering 
performance data slows down your server. Use it only occasionally to 
gather baseline data or when you’re experiencing a performance problem.
More Performance Tips
Here are a few last-minute performance tips that barely made it in:
	
✓	You can often find the source of a slow network by staring at the net­
work hubs or switches for a few minutes. These devices have colorful 
arrays of green and red lights. The green lights flash whenever data is 

358
Part V: Managing and Protecting Your Network 
transmitted; the red lights flash when a collision occurs. An occasional 
red flash is normal, but if one or more of the red lights is flashing repeat­
edly, the network interface card (NIC) connected to that port may be 
faulty.
	
✓	Check for scheduled tasks, such as backups, batched database updates, 
or report jobs. If at all possible, schedule these tasks to run after normal 
business hours, such as at night when no one is in the office. These jobs 
tend to slow down the network by hogging the server’s hard drives.
	
✓	Sometimes, faulty application programs can degrade performance. 
For example, some programs develop a memory leak. They use memory 
but then forget to release the memory after they finish. Programs 
with memory leaks can slowly eat up all the memory on a server, until 
the server runs out and grinds to a halt. If you think a program has a 
memory leak, contact the manufacturer of the program to see whether 
a fix is available.
	
✓	Spyware can slow a system to a crawl. A common source of performance 
problems on client computers is spyware, those annoying programs that 
you almost can’t help but pick up when you surf the Internet. Fortunately, 
you can remove spyware with a variety of free or inexpensive spyware 
removal tools. For more information, use Google or another search engine 
to search for spyware removal.

irtualization is one of the hottest trends in networking today. According 
to some industry pundits, virtualization is the best thing to happen to 
computers since the invention of the transistor. If you haven’t already begun 
to virtualize your network, you’re standing on the platform watching as the 
train is pulling out.
This chapter is a brief introduction to virtualization, with an emphasis on 
using it to leverage your network server hardware to provide more servers 
using less hardware. In addition to the general concepts of virtualization, you 
find out how to experiment with virtualization by using VMware’s free virtual­
ization product, VMware Player.
	
Mastering a virtualization environment calls for a book of its own. I recom­
mend two titles: Virtualization For Dummies, by Bernard Golden, and VMware 
Infrastructure 3 For Dummies, by William Lowe (no relation, honest).
Understanding Virtualization
The basic idea behind virtualization is to use software to simulate the 
existence of hardware. This powerful idea enables you to run more than 
one independent computer system on a single physical computer system. 
Suppose that your organization requires a total of 12 servers to meet its 
needs. You could run each of these 12 servers on a separate computer, in 
which case you would have 12 computers in your server room, or you could 
use virtualization to run these 12 servers on just 2 computers. In effect, each 

362
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
of those computers would simulate six separate computer systems, each 
running one of your servers.
Each of the simulated computers is a virtual machine (VM). For all intents 
and purposes, each virtual machine appears to be a complete, self-contained 
computer system with its own processor (or, more likely, processors), 
memory, disk drives, CD-ROM/DVD drives, keyboard, mouse, monitor, net­
work interfaces, USB ports, and so on.
Like a real computer, each virtual machine requires an operating system to 
do productive work. In a typical network server environment, each virtual 
machine runs its own copy of Windows Server 2012 (or an earlier version). 
The operating system has no idea that it’s running on a virtual machine 
rather than on a real machine.
Here are a few terms you need to be familiar with if you expect to discuss 
virtualization intelligently:
	
✓	Host: The actual physical computer on which one or more virtual 
machines run.
	
✓	Bare metal: Another term for the host computer that runs one or more 
virtual machines.
	
✓	Guest: Another term for a virtual machine running on a host.
	
✓	Guest operating system: An operating system that runs within a virtual 
machine. By itself, a guest is just a machine; it requires an operating 
system to run. The guest operating system is what brings the guest to life.
	
	As far as licensing is concerned, Microsoft treats each virtual machine 
as a separate computer. Thus, if you run six guests on a single host, and 
each guest runs Windows Server 2012, you need six licenses of Windows 
Server 2012.
	
✓	Hypervisor: The virtualization operating system that creates and runs 
virtual machines.
	
	The two basic types of hypervisors are Type 1 and Type 2. A Type 1 
hypervisor is a hypervisor that itself runs directly on the bare metal. A 
Type 2 hypervisor is a hypervisor that runs within an operating system, 
which in turn runs on the bare metal.
	
	For production use, you should always use Type 1 hypervisors because 
they’re much more efficient than Type 2 hypervisors. Type 1 hypervisors 
are considerably more expensive than Type 2 hypervisors, however. 
As a result, many people use inexpensive or free Type 2 hypervisors to 
experiment with virtualization before making a commitment to purchase 
an expensive Type 1 hypervisor.

363
 Chapter 24: Going Virtual
Looking at the Benefits of Virtualization
You might suspect that virtualization is inefficient because a real computer 
is inherently faster than a simulated computer. Although it’s true that real 
computers are faster than simulated computers, virtualization technology has 
become so advanced that the performance penalty for running on a virtualized 
machine rather than a real machine is only a few percent.
The small amount of overhead imposed by virtualization is usually more than 
made up for by the simple fact that even the most heavily used servers spend 
most of their time twiddling their digital thumbs, waiting for something to do. 
In fact, many servers spend nearly all their time doing nothing. As computers 
get faster and faster, they spend even more of their time with nothing to do.
Virtualization is a great way to put all this unused processing power to good use.
The long trek of virtualization
Kids these days think they invented everything, 
including virtualization.
Little do they know.
Virtualization was developed for PC-based 
computers in the early 1990s, around the time 
Captain Picard was flying the Enterprise around 
in Star Trek: The Next Generation.
But the idea is much older than that.
The first virtualized server computers predate 
Captain Picard by about 20 years. In 1972, IBM 
released an operating system called simply VM, 
which had nearly all the basic features found in 
today’s virtualization products.
VM allowed the administrators of IBM’s 
System/370 mainframe computers to create 
multiple independent virtual machines, each 
of which was called (you guessed it) a virtual 
machine, or VM. This terminology is still in use 
today.
Each VM could run one of the various guest 
operating systems that were compatible with 
the System/370 and appeared to this guest 
operating system to be a complete, indepen­
dent System/370 computer with its own proces­
sor cores, virtual memory, disk partitions, and 
input/output devices.
The core of the VM system itself was called 
the hypervisor — another term that persists to 
this day.
The VM product that IBM released in 1972 was 
actually based on an experimental product that 
IBM released on a limited basis in 1967.
So whenever someone tells you about this new 
technology called virtualization, you can tell 
them that it was invented when Star Trek was 
TV. When they ask, “You mean the one with 
Picard?” you can say, “No, the one with Kirk.”

Part VI: More Ways to Network 
Besides this basic efficiency benefit, virtualization has several compelling 
benefits:
	
✓	Hardware cost: You typically can save a lot of money by reducing 
hardware costs when you use virtualization. Suppose that you replace 
ten servers that cost $4,000 each with one host server. Granted, you’ll 
probably spend more than $4,000 on that server, because it needs to be 
maxed out with memory, processor cores, network interfaces, and so 
on. So you’ll probably end up spending $15,000 or $20,000 for the host 
server. Also, you’ll end up spending something like $5,000 for the hyper­
visor software. But that’s still a lot less than the $40,000 you would have 
spent on ten separate computers at $4,000 each.
	
✓	Energy costs: Many organizations have found that going virtual has 
reduced their overall electricity consumption for server computers by 
80 percent. This savings is a direct result of using less computer hard­
ware to do more work. One host computer running ten virtual servers 
uses approximately one-tenth the energy that would be used if each of 
the ten servers ran on separate hardware.
	
✓	Recoverability: One of the biggest benefits of virtualization isn’t the 
cost savings, but the ability to recover quickly from hardware failures. 
Suppose that your organization has ten servers, each running on sepa­
rate hardware. If any one of those servers goes down due to a hardware 
failure — say, a bad motherboard — that server will remain down until 
you can fix the computer. On the other hand, if those ten servers are 
running as virtual machines on two different hosts, and one of the hosts 
fails, the virtual machines that were running on the failed host can be 
brought up on the other host in a matter of minutes.
	
	Granted, the servers will run less efficiently on a single host than they 
would have on two hosts, but the point is that they’ll all be running after 
only a short downtime.
	
	In fact, with the most advanced hypervisors available, the transfer from 
a failing host to another host can be done automatically and instanta­
neously, so downtime is all but eliminated.
	
✓	Disaster recovery: Besides the benefit of recoverability when hardware 
failures occur, an even bigger benefit of virtualization comes into play 
in a true disaster-recovery situation. Suppose that your organization’s 
server infrastructure consists of 20 separate servers. In the case of a 
devastating disaster, such as a fire in the server room that destroys all 
hardware, how long will it take you to get all 20 of those servers back up 
and running on new hardware? Quite possibly, the recovery time will be 
measured in weeks.
	
	By contrast, virtual machines are actually nothing more than files that 
can be backed up onto tape. As a result, in a disaster-recovery situation, 
all you have to do is rebuild a single host computer and reinstall the 
hypervisor software. Then you can restore the virtual-machine backups 
from tape, restart the virtual machines, and get back up and running in a 
matter of days instead of weeks.

 Chapter 24: Going Virtual
Getting Started with Virtualization
Virtualization is a complex subject, and mastering the ins and outs of working 
with a full-fledged virtualization system like VMware Infrastructure is a topic 
that’s beyond the scope of this book. You can dip your toes into the shallow 
end of the virtualization pond, however, by downloading and experimenting 
with VMware’s free virtualization product, called VMware Player. You can 
download it from www.vmware.com.
Figure 24-1 shows the VMware Player main screen. From this screen, you 
can create a new virtual machine or run one of the virtual machines you’ve 
already created. As you can see in the figure, I’ve created several virtual 
machines, including a few that run various versions of Fedora (a popular 
Linux distribution) as well as two that run Windows Server 2008.
	
Figure 24-1: 
VMware 
Player lets 
you experi-
ment with 
virtualization.
	
You can run an existing virtual machine by selecting the VM and clicking Play 
Virtual Machine. This launches the virtual machine, which opens in a new 
window, as shown in Figure 24-2. When you launch a virtual machine, the VM 
behaves exactly as a real computer would when you power it up: First, it ini­
tializes its virtual hardware devices; then it loads the guest OS that has been 
installed in the VM. In Figure 24-2, Windows Server 2008 has booted up and is 
waiting for you to press Ctrl+Alt+Del to log on.

366
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
	
Figure 24-2: 
A virtual

Windows 
Server 
2008 R2.
	
The prompt to press Ctrl+Alt+Del shown in Figure 24-2 illustrates one of the 
peculiar details of running a virtual machine within a host operating system 
(in this case, running Windows Server 2008 R2 within Windows 7 Ultimate). 
When you press Ctrl+Alt+Del, which OS — the host or the guest — responds? 
The answer is that the host OS responds to Ctrl+Alt+Del, so the guest OS 
never sees it.
To get around this limitation, VMware uses the special keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl+Alt+End to send a Ctrl+Alt+Del to the guest OS. Alternatively, you can 
use the VM pull-down menu that appears in the menu bar above the virtual-
machine menu. This menu lists several actions that can be applied to the 
virtual machine, including Send Ctrl+Alt+Del.
Another detail you should know about when working with a VM is that when 
you click in the virtual machine’s window, the VM captures your mouse and 
keyboard, so your input will be directed to the virtual machine rather than 
the host computer. If you want to break the bonds of the virtual machine and 
return to the host computer, press Ctrl and Alt simultaneously.

367
 Chapter 24: Going Virtual
Creating a Virtual Machine
Creating a new virtual machine in VMware Player is relatively easy. In fact, 
the most challenging part is getting hold of the installation disc for the oper­
ating system you want to install on the VM. Remember that a virtual machine 
is useless without a guest operating system, so you need to have the installa­
tion disc available before you create the virtual machine.
If you just want to experiment with virtualization and don’t have extra 
licenses of a Windows server operating system, you can always download 
an evaluation copy of Windows Server from Microsoft at www.microsoft.
com/en-us/server-cloud/windows-server. The evaluation period is six 
months, so you’ll have plenty of time to experiment.
The downloadable trial version of Windows Server comes in the form of an 
ISO file, which is an image of a DVD file that you can mount within your vir­
tual machine as though it were a real disk.
When you have your ISO file or installation disc ready to go, you can create a 
new virtual machine by following these steps:
	
1.	Click Create a New Virtual Machine on the VMware Player home 
screen (refer to Figure 24-1).
	
	 This brings up the New Virtual Machine Wizard, as shown in Figure 24-3.
	
Figure 24-3: 
The first 
page of the 
New Virtual

Wizard.
	

368

2.	Choose the installation option you want to use.
	
	You have three choices:
 
• Installer Disc: Select this option and then choose from the drop-
down list the drive you’ll install from if you want to install from an 
actual CD or DVD.
 
• Install Disc Image File (iso): Select this option, click the Browse 
button, and browse to the ISO file that contains the installation 
image.
 
• I Will Install the Operating System Later: Select this option if you 
want to create the virtual machine now but install the operating 
system later.
	
	 Note that the remaining steps in this procedure assume that you select a 
Windows Server 2012 ISO file as the installation option.
	
3.	Click Next.
	
	The screen shown in Figure 24-4 appears. You can enter the product key 
now or skip this step until later.

wise, just click Next.
	
	You can always enter the product key later if you don’t have it handy 
now. Either way, the screen shown in Figure 24-5 appears next.

	The default setting is 40GB, but you can change it depending on your 
needs. Note that you must have sufficient space available on the host 
computer’s disk drive.
	
9.	Click Next.
	
	The wizard displays a final confirmation page, as shown in Figure 24-7.

10.	Click Finish.
	
	The wizard creates the virtual machine and then starts it. Because the 
machine doesn’t have an operating system installed, it boots from the 
CD/DVD installation image you specified back in Step 2. In this case, I 
booted with the Windows Server evaluation software disk image, so the 
new virtual machine displays the Install Windows screen, as shown in 
Figure 24-8.
	
11.	Follow the steps to install the OS.
	
	 Installing an OS in a virtual machine is exactly the same as installing 
it on a physical computer, except that the installation screens appear 
within a virtual-machine window.
	
	 When the OS is installed, you’re done! Then you can proceed to use the 
virtual machine.

You can adjust the hardware configuration of a virtual machine by choosing 
VM➪Settings while the virtual machine is running. This command brings up the 
Virtual Machine Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 24-9. From this dialog 
box, you can adjust the virtual machine’s hardware configuration, including the 
amount of RAM available to the VM and the number of processor cores. You 
can also adjust the disk drive size; add CD, DVD, or floppy drives; and configure 
network adapters, USB connections, and sound and display settings.

L

inux, the free operating system (OS) based on Unix, is a popular alter­
native to Windows Server, especially for specific applications such as 
web servers or e-mail servers. Linux can also be used as a firewall or as a file 
server and print server on your local area network (LAN).
Linux has many advantages over Windows, not the least of which is that it is 
free. But price isn’t the only advantage. Many network administrators have 
found that Linux is more stable than Windows, crashing less often and requir­
ing less downtime for maintenance. In addition, Linux has a solid reputation 
for efficiency and security.
Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, who was then an undergraduate 
student at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Linus thought it’d be fun to 
create his own OS based on Unix for his brand-new PC. In the nearly two 
decades since Linux was first conceived, Linux has become a full-featured 
operating system that is fast and reliable.
This chapter shows the basics of setting up a Linux server on your network 
and using it as a file server, as a web server for the Internet or an intranet, as 
an e-mail server, and as a router and firewall to help connect your network to 
the Internet.
	
Linux is a complicated OS. Understanding how to use it can be a daunting task, 
especially if your only prior computer experience is with Windows. John Wiley 
& Sons, Inc., has For Dummies books that make Linux less painful. You’ll find 
more comprehensive information about Linux in my book, Networking All-in-
One For Dummies, 5th Edition; and you may also want to check out Linux For 
Dummies, 9th Edition, by Richard Blum.

Part VI: More Ways to Network 
Comparing Linux with Windows
If your only computer experience is with Windows, you’re in for a steep learn­
ing curve when you first get into Linux. There are many fundamental differ­
ences between the Linux operating system and Windows. Here are some of 
the more important differences:
	
✓	Linux is a multiuser operating system. More than one user can log on 
and use a Linux computer at the same time:
 
• Two or more users can log on to a Linux computer from the same 
keyboard and monitor by using virtual consoles, which let you switch 
from one user session to another with a special key combination.
 
• Users can log on to the Linux computer from a terminal window 
running on another computer on the network.
	
	Most versions of Windows are single-user systems. Only one user at a 
time can log on to a Windows computer and run commands. (Windows 
Server can be configured as a multiuser system with terminal services.)
	
✓	Linux doesn’t have a built-in graphical user interface (GUI) as 
Windows does. The GUI in Linux is provided by an optional component 
called X Window System. You can run Linux without X Window, in which 
case you interact with Linux by typing commands. If you prefer to use a 
GUI, you must install and run X Window.
	
	X Window is split into two parts:
 
• A server component — X Server — manages multiple windows and 
provides graphics services for application programs.
 
• A UI component — a window manager — provides user interface 
(UI) features, such as menus, buttons, toolbars, and a taskbar.
	
	Several window managers are available, each with a different look and 
feel. With Windows, you’re stuck with the UI that Microsoft designed. 
With Linux, you can use the UI of your choosing.
	
✓	Linux can’t run Windows programs. Nope, you can’t run Microsoft 
Office on a Linux system; instead, you must find a similar program that’s 
written specifically for Linux. Many Linux distributions come with the 
OpenOffice suite, which provides word processing, spreadsheet, pre­
sentation, graphics, database, e-mail, calendar, and scheduling software. 
Thousands of other programs are available for Linux.
	
	Windows emulator programs — the best-known is Wine — can run 
some Windows programs on Linux. However, the emulators run only some 
Windows programs, and they run them slower than they would run on 
a Windows system.
	
✓	Linux doesn’t do Plug and Play the way Windows does. Major Linux 
distributions come with configuration programs that can automatically 

375
 Chapter 25: Networking with Linux
detect and configure the most common hardware components, but 
Linux doesn’t have built-in support for Plug-and-Play hardware devices. 
You’re more likely to run into a hardware-configuration problem with 
Linux than with Windows.
	
✓	Linux uses a different system for accessing disk drives and files than 
Windows does. For an explanation of how the Linux file system works, 
see the “I can’t see my C drive!” sidebar that’s coming up in this chapter.
	
✓	Linux runs better on older hardware than the current incarnations of 
Windows do. Linux is an ideal OS for an older Pentium computer with at 
least 32MB of RAM and 2GB of hard drive space.
	
	If you’re fond of antiques, Linux can run well on even a 486 computer 
with as little as 4MB of RAM and a few hundred MB of disk space.
I can’t see my C drive!
Well, no, but that’s normal. Linux and Windows 
have completely different ways of referring to 
your computer’s disk drives and partitions. The 
differences can take some getting used to for 
experienced Windows users.
Windows uses a separate letter for each drive 
and partition on your system. For example, if you 
have a single drive formatted into three parti­
tions, Windows identifies the partitions as drives 
C, D, and E. Each of these drives has its own 
root directory, which can in turn contain addi­
tional directories used to organize your files. As 
far as Windows is concerned, drives C, D, and E 
are completely separate drives even though the 
drives are actually just partitions on a single drive.
Linux doesn’t use drive letters. Instead, Linux 
combines all the drives and partitions into a 
single directory hierarchy. In Linux, one of the 
partitions is designated as the root partition. 
The root is roughly analogous to the C drive 
on a Windows system. Then, the other parti­
tions can be mounted on the root partition 
and treated as if they were directories on the 
root partition. For example, you might des­
ignate the first partition as the root partition 
and then mount the second partition as /user 
and the third partition as /var. Then any files 
stored in the /user directory would actu­
ally be stored in the second partition, and files 
stored in the /var directory would be stored 
in the third partition.
The directory where a drive mounts is the 
drive’s mount point.
Notice that Linux uses regular forward-slash 
characters (/) to separate directory names 
rather than the backward-slash characters (\) 
used by Windows. Typing backslashes instead 
of regular slashes is one of the most common 
mistakes made by new Linux users.
While I’m on the subject, Linux uses a different 
convention for naming files, too. In Windows, 
filenames end in a three-letter (sometimes more 
letters than that) extension separated from the 
rest of the filename by a period. The extension is 
used to indicate the file type. For example, files 
that end in .exe are program files, but files that 
end in .doc are word-processing documents.
Linux doesn’t use filename extensions, but peri­
ods are often used in Linux filenames to sepa­
rate different parts of the name — and the last 
part often indicates the file type. For example, 
ldap.conf and pine.conf are both con­
figuration files.

376
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
Choosing a Linux Distribution
Because the kernel (the core operating functions) of the Linux OS is free, sev­
eral companies have created their own distributions of Linux, which include 
the Linux OS along with a bundle of packages, such as administration tools, 
web servers, and other useful utilities as well as printed documentation.
The following are some of the more popular Linux distributions:
	
✓	Fedora: One of the popular Linux distributions. You can download 
Fedora free from http://fedoraproject.org. You can also obtain it 
by purchasing any of several books on Fedora that include the Fedora 
distribution on DVD or CD-ROM.
	
	All the examples in this chapter are based on Fedora 17.
	
✓	Mandriva Linux: Another popular Linux distribution, one that is often 
recommended as the easiest for first-time Linux users to install. This dis­
tribution was formerly known as Mandrake Linux. Go to www.mandriva.
com for more information.
	
✓	Ubuntu: A Linux distribution that has gained popularity in recent years. 
It focuses on ease of use. For more information, go to www.ubuntu.com.
	
✓	SUSE: Pronounced SOO-zuh, like the name of the famous composer of 
marches; a popular Linux distribution sponsored by Novell. You can find 
more information at www.suse.com.
	
✓	Slackware: One of the oldest Linux distributions and still popular, espe­
cially among Linux old-timers. A full installation of Slackware gives you 
all the tools that you need to set up a network or Internet server. See 
www.slackware.com for more information.
All distributions of Linux include the same core components: the Linux 
kernel, an X Server, popular windows managers (such as GNOME and KDE), 
compilers, Internet programs such as Apache, Sendmail, and so on. However, 
not all Linux distributions are created equal. In particular, the manufacturer 
of each distribution creates its own installation and configuration programs 
to install and configure Linux.
The installation program is what makes or breaks a Linux distribution. All the 
distributions I list in this section have easy-to-use installation programs that 
automatically detect the hardware that’s present on your computer and con­
figure Linux to work with that hardware, thus eliminating most — if not all — 
manual configuration chores. The installation programs also let you select 
the Linux packages that you want to install and let you set up one or more 
user accounts besides the root account.

377
 Chapter 25: Networking with Linux
Installing Linux
All the Linux distributions I describe in the earlier section, “Choosing a Linux 
Distribution,” include an installation program that simplifies installing Linux 
on your computer. The installation program asks you a series of questions 
about your hardware, what components of Linux you want to install, and how 
you want to configure certain features. Then it copies the appropriate files 
to your hard drive and configures your Linux system.
	
If the thought of installing Linux gives you hives, you can buy computers with 
Linux preinstalled, just as you can buy computers with Windows already 
installed.
	
An excellent way to dip your feet into the Linux waters is to install it on a 
virtual machine, using a free virtual platform such as VMware Player or 
Oracle’s VirtualBox.
Before you begin to install Linux, I recommend several planning steps:
	
✓	Hardware: Make a list of all the hardware components on your computer 
and how they’re configured.
	
✓	Partitioning: Decide how you want to partition your hard drive for Linux.
	
	Although Windows is usually installed into a single disk partition, Linux 
installations typically require at least three hard-drive partitions:
 
• A boot partition: This should be small; 16MB is recommended. The 
boot partition contains the OS kernel and is required to start Linux 
properly on some computers.
 
• A swap partition: This should be about twice the size of your com­
puter’s RAM. For example, if the computer has 2GB of RAM, allocate 
a 4GB swap partition. Linux uses this partition as an extension of 
your computer’s RAM.
 
• A root partition: This, in most cases, uses up the remaining free 
space on the disk. The root partition contains all the files and 
data used by your Linux system.
	
	You can also create additional partitions if you wish. The installation 
program includes a disk-partitioning feature that lets you set up your 
disk partitions and indicate the mount point for each partition. (For 
more information about disk partitions, see the sidebar, “I can’t see my 
C drive!,” earlier in this chapter.)
	
✓	Packages: Decide which optional Linux packages to install along with 
the Linux kernel:

378
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
 
• All: If you have enough drive space, install all the packages that come 
with your distribution. That way, if you decide you need to use a 
package, you won’t have to figure out how to install the package 
outside of the installation program.
 
• Pick and choose: If you’re tight on space, make sure that you at least 
install the basic network and Internet server packages, including 
Apache, Sendmail, FTP, and Samba.
	
✓	Password: Set the password for the root account.
	
✓	User accounts: In most distributions, you choose whether to create at 
least one user account.
	
	Create at least one user account during installation so you can log on to 
Linux as a user (not with the root account). As a user, you can experi­
ment with Linux commands without accidentally deleting or corrupting 
a needed system file.
On Again, Off Again
Any user who accesses a Linux system, whether locally or over a network, 
must be authenticated by a valid user account on the system. The following 
sections lay out the whys, hows, and wherefores of logging on and logging off 
a Linux system — and how to shut down the system.
Logging on
When Linux boots up, it displays a series of startup messages while it starts 
the various services that make up a working Linux system. Assuming that 
you selected X Server when you installed Linux, you’re eventually greeted by 
the screen, as shown in Figure 25-1. To log on to Linux, click your user ID if is 
displayed. If your user ID isn’t displayed, click Not Listed and then enter your 
user ID. Then, when prompted, type your password and press Enter.
	
As a part of the installation process, the Setup Agent creates a user account 
for you. Use this user account rather than the root user account whenever 
possible. Use the root account only when you’re making major changes to 
the system’s configuration. When you’re doing routine work, log on as an 
ordinary user to avoid accidentally corrupting your system.
When you log on, Linux grinds its gears for a moment and then displays the 
GNOME desktop, which I describe later in this chapter.

379

to Linux.
	
Logging off
After you log on, you probably want to know how to log off. To do so, hover 
the mouse over your name in the top right corner of the screen, then choose 
Log Out.
Shutting down
Like with any OS, you shouldn’t turn off the power to a Linux server without 
shutting down the system. The two ways to shut down Linux are
	
✓	Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
	
✓	Click your user name in the upper right of the screen and then click 
Shutdown.
Using GNOME
Figure 25-2 shows a typical GNOME desktop. Although the GNOME desktop 
looks a lot different from the Windows desktop, many of the basic skills used 

380
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
for working with Microsoft Windows — moving or resizing windows, minimiz­
ing or maximizing windows, and using drag-and-drop to move items between 
windows — are almost exactly the same in GNOME.
	
Figure 25-2: 
A typical 
GNOME 
desktop.
	
Here are some key features of the GNOME desktop:
	
✓	Activities: The Activities Overview provides a single access point for all 
GNOME applications. It provides fast access to common functions, such 
as Internet browsing, e-mail, or file management, as well as desktop access 
to other applications. You can access Activities Overview by pressing the 
Windows key on the keyboard or clicking Activities in the top-left corner. 
(The screen in Figure 25-2 shows the Activities Overview open.)
	
✓	Search box: The search box in the top-right corner is the easiest way to 
find things in GNOME. For example, if you want to run the gedit program 
to edit a text file, search for “gedit.” Or if you want to fiddle with network 
settings, search for “Network.”
	
✓	Settings: To manage your system or user settings, click your name at the 
top right of the screen. This reveals a menu with options for various 
settings.
Getting to a Command Shell
A command shell is a text-based window in which you can enter Linux commands 
directly, bypassing the graphical user interface. You can get to a command shell 
in one of two basic ways when you need to run Linux commands directly. 

381
 Chapter 25: Networking with Linux
The first is to press Ctrl+Alt+Fx to switch to one of the virtual consoles, 
where Fx is one of the function keys, from F1 through F12. (A virtual console 
is simply a text-mode command prompt.) Then, you can log on and run 
commands to your heart’s content. When you’re done, press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to 
return to GNOME.
Alternatively, you can open a command shell directly in GNOME by opening 
the Activities Overview, clicking Applications, and then clicking the Terminal 
icon. This opens a command shell in a window right on the GNOME desktop, 
as shown in Figure 25-3. Because this shell runs within the user account that 
GNOME is logged on as, you don’t have to log on. You can just start typing 
commands. When you’re done, type Exit to close the window.
	
Figure 25-3: 
Using a 
Terminal 
window to 
run Linux 
commands.
	
Managing User Accounts
One of the most common network administration tasks is adding a user 
account. The Setup Agent prompts you to create a user account the first time 
you start Linux after installing it. However, you’ll probably need to create 
additional accounts.
Each Linux user account has the following information associated with it:
	
✓	Username: The name the user types to log on to the Linux system.
	
✓	Full name: The user’s full name.

382
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
	
✓	Home directory: The directory where the user is placed when he logs on. 
In Fedora, the default home directory is /home/username. For example, 
if the username is blowe, the home directory will be /home/blowe.
	
✓	Shell: The program used to process Linux commands. Several shell 
programs are available. In most distributions, the default shell is 
/bin/bash.
	
✓	Group: You can create group accounts, which makes it easy to apply 
identical access rights to groups of users. Group accounts are option, 
but useful if you have more than just a few users.
	
✓	User ID: The internal identifier for the user.
You can add a new user by using the useradd command. For example, 
to create a user account named slowe, using default values for the other 
account information, open a Terminal window or switch to a virtual console 
and type this command:
# useradd slowe
The useradd command has many optional parameters that you can use to 
set account information, such as the user’s home directory and shell.
Fortunately, most Linux distributions come with special programs that sim­
plify routine system management tasks. For example, Fedora comes with the 
user Manager program, as shown in Figure 25-4. To start this program, click 
Activities, click Applications, and then double-click Users and Groups (scroll 
down to find it).
	
Figure 25-4: 
Managing 
users and 
groups.
	

383
 Chapter 25: Networking with Linux
To create a user with User Manager, click the Add User button. This brings 
up a dialog box that asks for the user’s name, password, and other informa­
tion. Fill out this dialog box and then click OK.
The User Manager also lets you create groups. You can simplify the task of 
administering users by applying access rights to groups rather than indi­
vidual users. Then, when a user needs access to a resource, you can add the 
user to the group that has the needed access.
To create a group, click the Add Group button. A dialog box appears, asking 
for the name of the new group. Type the name you want and then click OK.
To add a user to a group, click the Groups tab in the User Manager. Then, 
double-click the group to which you want to add users. This brings up the 
Group Properties dialog box. Click the Group Users tab and then select the 
users that you want to belong to the group.
Network Configuration
In many cases, configuring a Linux server for networking is a snap. When you 
install Linux, the Installation program automatically detects your network 
adapters and installs the appropriate drivers. Then you’re prompted for 
basic network-configuration information, such as the computer’s IP address, 
hostname, and so on.
You may need to manually change your network settings after installation or 
configure advanced networking features that aren’t configured during instal­
lation. In the following sections, you get a look at the basic procedures for 
configuring Linux networking services.
Using the Network Configuration program
Before you can use a network interface to access a network, you have to 
configure the interface’s basic TCP/IP options, such as its IP address, host 
name, Domain Name System (DNS) servers, and so on. This configuration is 
automatically set up when you install Linux, but you may need to change it 
later on. In this section, I show you how to do that by using Fedora’s Network 
settings program. You can access this program by clicking your name in the 
top-right corner of the screen, choosing Settings, and then choosing Network.
	
Most other Linux distributions have similar programs.
The Network Configuration program lets you configure the basic TCP/IP settings 
for a network interface by pointing and clicking your way through tabbed 
windows. Figure 25-5 shows the Network Configuration program in action.

384
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
	
Figure 25-5: 
The 
Network 
Configuration  
program.
	
Notice that the main window of the Network Configuration lists all the net­
work interfaces installed in your computer. You can double-click any of the 
interfaces to bring up a window similar to the one shown in Figure 25-6. This 
window lets you set the configuration options for the network interface, such 
as its IP address and other TCP/IP–configuration information.
	
Figure 25-6:

IP settings

 Chapter 25: Networking with Linux
Restarting your network
Whenever you make a configuration change to your network, you must restart 
Linux networking services for the change to take effect. If you find that annoying, 
just be thankful that you don’t have to restart the entire computer. Simply 
restarting the network services is sufficient.
Open a console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+n, where n is a number from 2–7. Log in 
using the root account and then enter the following command:
service network restart
To confirm that the service was properly restarted, you’ll see a message 
similar to this:
Restarting network (via systemctl):                       [  OK  ]
Doing the Samba Dance
Until now, you probably thought of Samba as an intricate Brazilian dance 
with fun rhythms. But in the Linux world, Samba refers to a file- and printer-
sharing program that allows Linux to mimic a Windows file-and-print server 
so Windows computers can use shared Linux directories and printers. If you 
want to use Linux as a file or print server in a Windows network, you have to 
know how to dance the Samba.
Understanding Samba
Because Linux and Windows have such different file systems, you can’t 
create a Linux file server simply by granting Windows users access to Linux 
directories. Windows client computers wouldn’t be able to access files in the 
Linux directories. Too many differences exist between the file systems. For 
example:
	
✓	Case sensitivity: Linux filenames are case sensitive, whereas Windows 
filenames are not. For example, in Windows, File1.txt and file1.
txt are the same file. In Linux, they’re different files.
	
✓	File extensions: In Linux, periods aren’t used to denote file extensions.
	
	Linux filenames don’t use extensions.
	
✓	File attributes: Windows has file attributes like read-only and archive. 
Linux doesn’t have these.

386
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
More fundamentally, Windows networking uses the Server Message Block 
(SMB) protocol to manage the exchange of file data among file servers and 
clients. Linux doesn’t have SMB support built in. And that’s why Samba is 
required. Samba is a program that mimics the behavior of a Windows-based 
file server by implementing the SMB protocol. So when you run Samba on a 
Linux server, the Windows computers on your network see the Linux server 
as if it were a Windows server.
Like a Windows server, Samba works by designating certain directories as 
shares. A share is simply a directory that’s made available to other users via 
the network. Each share has the following elements:
	
✓	Name: The name by which the share is known over the network
	
	Share names should be eight characters whenever possible.
	
✓	Path: The path to the directory on the Linux computer that’s being 
shared, such as \Users\Doug
	
✓	Description: A one-line description of the share
	
✓	Access: A list of users or groups who have been granted access to the 
share
	
Samba also includes a client program that lets a Linux computer access 
Windows file servers.
	
Why did Samba’s developers choose to call their program Samba? Simply 
because the protocol that Windows file and print servers use to communicate 
with each other is SMB. Add a couple of vowels to SMB, and you get Samba.
Installing Samba
If you didn’t install Samba when you installed Linux, you’ll have to install it 
now. Here are the steps:
	
1.	Click Activities, Applications, and then Add/Remove Software.
	
	This summons the Add/Remove Software program.
	
2.	Type Samba in the search text box and click Find.
	
	A list of Samba packages appears in the window’s main list box.
	
3.	Select the package labeled Server and Client Software to Interoperate 
with Windows Machines.
	
	This is the basic Samba package.
	
4.	Scroll down a bit and also choose the Samba Server Configuration Tool 
package.
	
	This package provides a user-friendly interface for configuring Samba.

387
 Chapter 25: Networking with Linux
	
5.	Click Apply.
	
	 The Add/Remove Software program grinds and whirs for a moment and 
then installs the package you selected.
	
6.	Close the Add/Remove Software program.
	
	 Samba is now installed.
	
One sure way to render a Samba installation useless is to enable the default 
Linux firewall settings on the computer that runs Samba. The Linux firewall is 
designed to prevent users from accessing network services, such as Samba. 
It’s designed to be used between the Internet and your local network — not 
between Samba and your local network. Although you can configure the fire­
wall to allow access to Samba only to your internal network, a much better 
option is to run the firewall on a separate computer. That way, the firewall 
computer can concentrate on being a firewall, and the file server computer 
can concentrate on being a file server.
Starting and stopping Samba
Before you can use Samba, you must start its two daemons, smbd and nmbd. 
(Daemon is the Linux term for service, which is a program that runs as a 
background task.) Both daemons can be started at once by starting the SMB 
service. From a command shell, use this command:
service smb start
Whenever you make a configuration change, such as adding a new share or 
creating a new Samba user, you should stop and restart the service with this 
command:
service smb restart
If you prefer, you can stop and start the service with separate commands:
service smb stop
service smb start
If you’re not sure whether Samba is running, enter this command:
service smb status
You get a message indicating whether the smbd and nmbd daemons are running.
To configure Samba to start automatically when you start Linux, use this 
command:
chkconfig –level 35 smb on

388
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
To make sure that the chkconfig command worked right, enter this command:
chkconfig –list smb
You should see output similar to the following:
Smb      0:off  1:off  2:off  3:on   4:off  5:on   6:off
	
You can independently configure services to start automatically for each of 
the six boot levels of Linux. Boot level 3 is normal operation without a GUI; 
level 5 is normal operation with a GUI. So setting SMB to start for levels 3 and 
5 makes SMB available, regardless of whether you’re using a GUI.
Using the Samba Server Configuration tool
Fedora includes a handy GNOME-based configuration tool that simplifies 
the task of configuring Samba. To start it, click Activities, click Applications, 
and then click Samba. When you do so, the Samba Server Configuration tool 
appears, as shown in Figure 25-7. This tool lets you configure basic server 
settings and manage shares.
	
Figure 25-7: 
Using the 
Samba 
Server  
Configuration  
tool.
	
To make your Samba server visible on the network, choose Preferences➪Server 
Settings. This brings up a dialog box that lets you set the workgroup name 
(which must match the workgroup or domain name you want the Samba server 
to belong to) and a description for the server, as well as some basic security set­
tings that control how users can access the Samba server.

389
 Chapter 25: Networking with Linux
You can set four basic types of security for your Samba server:
	
✓	Domain: Configures the Samba server to use a Windows domain controller 
to verify the user. If you specify this option, you must
 
• Provide the domain controller’s name in the Authentication Server 
field.
 
• Set Encrypted Passwords to Yes (if you use Domain mode).
	
✓	Server: Configures Samba to use another Samba server to authenticate 
users.
	
	If you have more than one Samba server, this feature lets you set up 
user accounts on just one of the servers. Then, in the Authentication 
Server field, specify the name of the Samba server that should perform 
the authentication.
	
✓	Share: Authorizes users separately for each share they attempt to access.
	
✓	User: Requires that users provide a valid username and password when 
they first connect to a Samba server. That authentication then grants 
them access to all shares on the server, subject to the restrictions of the 
account they’re authorized under.
	
	User mode is the default.
For each network user who needs to access the Samba server, you must
	
1.	 Create a Linux user account for each user.
	
2.	 Create a separate Samba user account.
	
	 To create a Samba user account, choose Preferences➪Samba Users 
from the Samba Server Configuration window. This brings up the Samba 
Users dialog box, as shown in Figure 25-8. You can use this dialog box to 
add, edit, or delete users.
	
	 The Samba user account maps to an existing Linux user account, so you 
must create the Linux user account first.
	
Figure 25-8: 
The Samba 
Users dialog 
box lists 
your Samba 
users.
	

390
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
To be useful, a file server should offer one or more shares — directories that 
have been designated as publicly accessible via the network. Again, you use 
the Samba Server Configuration program to manage your shares. To add a 
share, click the Add button on the Samba Server Configuration program’s 
toolbar. This brings up the Create Samba Share dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 25-9. You can then
	
✓	Enter the path for the directory you want to share.
	
✓	Enter a description for the share.
	
✓	Select whether to allow either read-only or read-write access.
	
✓	Click the Access tab if you want to set limits on access (for example, to 
specific users).
	
Figure 25-9: 
The Create 
Samba 
Share  
dialog box.
	
	
When you create a new share using the Samba Configuration program, the 
share should be immediately visible to network users. If not, try restarting the 
Samba server, as I describe in the section, “Starting and stopping Samba,” in 
this chapter.

T

his book dwells on mostly networking Windows-based computers, as 
though Microsoft were the only game in town. I’m sure plenty of people 
in Redmond, WA (where Microsoft is headquartered) wished that it were 
so. But alas, there is an entirely different breed of computer: the Apple 
Macintosh, more commonly referred to simply as Mac.
Every Macintosh ever built, even an original 1984 model, includes networking 
support. Newer Macintosh computers have better built-in networking features 
than older Macintosh computers, of course. The newest Macs include built-in 
Gigabit Ethernet connections or 802.11n wireless connections, or both. Support 
for these network connections is pretty much automatic, so all you have to 
do is plug your Mac into a network or connect to a wireless network, and 
you’re ready to go.
This chapter presents what you need to know to network Mac computers 
running OS X, Apple’s operating system for Mac computers. You’ll see how 
to control basic Mac network options, such as TCP/IP and file sharing. I also 
show you how to join a Mac to a Windows domain network.
Basic Mac Network Settings
Most network settings on OS X are automatic. If you wish, you can look at and 
change the default network settings by following these steps:
	
1.	Choose System Preferences➪ Networking.
	
	 The Network preferences page appears, as shown in Figure 26-1.

392
Part VI: More Ways to Network

2.	Click Advanced.
	
	 The advanced network settings are displayed, as shown in Figure 26-2. 
	
Figure 26-2: 
Advanced 
network 
settings.
	
	
3.	Click the TCP/IP tab to view or change the TCP/IP settings.
	
	 This brings up the TCP/IP settings, as shown in Figure 26-3. From this 
page, you can view the currently assigned IP address for the computer. 
And, if you wish, you can assign a static IP address by changing the 
Configure IPv4 drop-down from Using DHCP to Manually. Then, you can 

393
 Chapter 26: Macintosh Networking
enter your own IP address, subnet mask, and router address. (For more 
information about IP addresses, refer to Chapter 5.)
	
4.	Click the DNS tab to view or change the DNS settings.
	
	 This brings up the DNS settings shown in Figure 26-4. Here, you can see 
the DNS servers being used, and you can add additional DNS servers if 
you wish.

5.	Click the Hardware tab to view hardware information.
	
	 This brings up the settings page shown in Figure 26-5. The most useful 
bit of information on this tab is the MAC address, which is sometimes 
needed to set up wireless security. (For more information, refer to 
Chapter 9.)

What about OS X Server?
At one time, Apple offered the Mac OS X Server 
dedicated network operating system (NOS). In 
2011, Apple merged Mac OS X Server with its 
desktop OS and made the server components 
of the OS available as an inexpensive add-on 
you can purchase from the App Store. For the 
latest version of OS X (10.8, released in July of 
2012), the Server App enhancement can be pur­
chased for about $20.
The Server App download adds a variety of net­
work server features to OS X, including
	✓	Apache web server, which also runs on 
Windows and Linux systems
	✓	MySQL, which is also available in Windows 
and Linux versions
	✓	Wiki Server, which lets you set up web-
based wiki, blog, and calendaring sites
	✓	NetBoot, a feature that simplifies the task of 
managing network client computers
	✓	Spotlight Server, which lets you search for 
content on remote file servers
	✓	Podcast Producer, which lets the create 
and distribute multimedia programs

 Chapter 26: Macintosh Networking
Joining a Domain
If you’re using a Mac in a Windows domain environment, you can join the 
Mac to the domain by following these steps:
	
1.	Choose Settings➪Users & Groups.
	
	 This brings up the Users & Groups page, as shown in Figure 26-6.
	
Figure 26-6: 
Users and 
Groups.
	
	
2.	Select the user account you want to join to the domain and then click 
Login Options.
	
	The Login Options page appears, as shown in Figure 26-7. 
	
Figure 26-7: 
Login 
Options.

3.	If the lock icon at the bottom left of the page is locked, click it and 
enter your password when prompted.
	
	 By default, the user login options are locked to prevent unauthorized 
changes. This step unlocks the settings so that you can join the domain.
	
4.	Click the Join button.
	
	You’re prompted to enter the name of the domain you want to join, as 
shown in Figure 26-8.
	
Figure 26-8: 
Joining a 
domain.
	
	
5.	Enter the name of the domain you want to join.
	
	 When you enter the domain name, the dialog box expands to allow you 
to enter domain credentials to allow you to join the domain, as shown in 
Figure 26-9.
	
Figure 26-9: 
Authenticat-
ing with the 
domain.
	

397
 Chapter 26: Macintosh Networking
	
6.	Enter the name and password of a domain administrator account; then 
click OK.
	
	 You return to the Login Options page, which shows that you have suc­
cessfully joined the domain; see Figure 26-10.
	
Figure 26-10: 
Congratula-
tions! You 
have now 
joined the 
domain.
	
	
7.	Close the Users & Groups window.
Connecting to a Share
After you join a domain, you can access its network shares via the Finder. 
Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Click Finder.
	
2.	Choose Go➪Connect to Server.
	
	The Connect to Server dialog box appears.
	
3.	Type the path that leads to the server share you want to connect to.
	
	 To type a network path, follow this syntax:
smb://server-name/share-name
	
	 Replace the server-name with the name of the server that contains 
the share and share-name with the name of the share. For example, 
to connect to a share named files on a server named lowe01, type 
smb://lowe01/files.

398
Part VI: More Ways to Network 
	
4.	Click Connect.
	
	You’ll be prompted for login credentials.
	
5.	Enter a domain username and password and then click OK.
	
	 Precede the user name with the domain name, separated by a backslash. 
For example, if the domain name is lowewriter.pri and the user 
name is Doug, enter lowewriter.pri\Doug as the username.
	
	 After connection is complete, the files in the share display in the Finder 
window. You can then open files directly from the share (provided you 
have the right software, such as Microsoft Office, to read the files). You 
can also drag and drop files between the Mac and the file shares.

Ten Networking Commandments
 “Blessed is the network manager who walks not in the council of the 
ignorant, nor stands in the way of the oblivious, nor sits in the seat of the 
greenhorn, but delights in the Law of the Network and meditates on this Law 
day and night.”
— Networks 1:1
A

nd so it came to pass that these Ten Networking Commandments were 
handed down from generation to generation, to be worn as frontlets 
between the computer geeks’ eyes (taped on the bridges of their broken 
glasses) and written upon their doorposts with Sharpie markers. Obey these 
commandments, and it shall go well with you, with your users, and with your 
users’ users.
I. Thou Shalt Back Up Thy 
Hard Drive Religiously
Prayer is a good thing, and I heartily recommend it. But when it comes to pro­
tecting the data on your network, nothing beats a well-thought-out schedule 
of backups followed religiously. (If this were an actual network Bible, a foot­
note here would refer you to related verses in Chapter 21.)
II. Thou Shalt Protect Thy 
Network from Infidels
One of my favorite classic TV series is M*A*S*H. One of the recurring char­
acters on that show was Colonel Flagg, who hid in trash cans looking for 
Communists. I don’t recommend that you actually become him, but on the 
other hand, you don’t want to ignore the possibility of getting zapped by a 
virus, your network being invaded by hackers, or your data being compro­
mised by an unscrupulous user. Make sure that your Internet connection is 

402
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
properly secured with a firewall and don’t allow any Internet access that 
circumvents your security.
To counter virus threats, use network-aware antivirus software to ensure that 
every user on your network has up-to-date virus protection. And teach your 
users so they know how to avoid those virus threats that manage to sneak 
past your virus protection.
III. Thou Shalt Keepeth Thy Network 
Drive Pure and Cleanse It of Old Files
Don’t wait until your 2TB network drive is down to just 1GB of free space 
before you think about cleaning it up. Set up a routine schedule for disk 
housekeeping, where you wade through the files and directories on the net­
work disk to remove old junk.
IV. Thou Shalt Not Tinker with Thine 
Network Configuration Unless Thou 
Knowest What Thou Art Doing
Networks are finicky things. After yours is up and running, don’t mess with 
it unless you know what you’re doing. You may be tempted to log on to your 
firewall router to see whether you can tweak some of its settings to squeeze 
another ounce of performance out of it. But unless you know what you’re 
doing, be careful! (Be especially careful if you think you know what you’re 
doing. It’s the people who think they know what they’re doing who get them­
selves into trouble!)
V. Thou Shalt Not Covet 
Thy Neighbor’s Network
Network envy is a common malady among network managers. If your net­
work users are humming along fine at 100 Mbps, don’t covet your neighbor’s 
Gigabit network. If your network users are happy with Windows 7, resist the 

403
 Chapter 27: Ten Networking Commandments
urge to upgrade to Windows 8 unless you have a really good reason. And if 
you run Windows Server 2008, fantasizing about Windows Server 2012 is a 
venial sin.
You’re especially susceptible to network envy if you’re a gadget freak. 
There’s always a better switch to be had or some fancy network-protocol 
gizmo to lust after. Don’t give in to these base urges! Resist the devil, and he 
will flee!
VI. Thou Shalt Schedule Downtime 
before Working upon Thy Network
As a courtesy, try to give your users plenty of advance notice before you 
take down the network to work on it. Obviously, you can’t predict when 
random problems strike. But if you know you’re going to patch the server 
on Thursday morning, you earn points if you tell everyone about the incon­
venience two days before rather than two minutes before. (You’ll earn even 
more points if you patch the server Saturday morning. Tell your boss you’ll 
take next Thursday morning off to make it up.)
VII. Thou Shalt Keep an Adequate 
Supply of Spare Parts
There’s no reason that your network should be down for two days just 
because a cable breaks. Always make sure that you have at least a minimal 
supply of network spare parts on hand. (As luck would have it, Chapter 30 
suggests ten things you should keep in your closet.)
VIII. Thou Shalt Not Steal Thy Neighbor’s 
Program without a License
How would you like it if Inspector Clouseau (from the Pink Panther movies) 
barged into your office, looked over your shoulder as you ran Excel from a 
network server, and asked, “Do you have a liesaunce?”
“A liesaunce?” you reply, puzzled.

404
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
“Yes. of course, a liesaunce — that is what I said! The law specifically pro­
hibits the playing of a computer program on a network without a proper 
liesaunce.”
You don’t want to get in trouble with Inspector Clouseau, do you? Then make 
sure you have the correct licenses for the applications you run on your 
network.
IX. Thou Shalt Train Thy Users 
in the Ways of the Network
Don’t blame the users if they don’t know how to use the network. It’s not 
their fault. If you’re the network administrator, your job is to provide training 
so the network users know how to use the network.
X. Thou Shalt Write Down Thy Network 
Configuration upon Tablets of Stone
Network documentation should be written down. If you cross the River 
Jordan, who else will know diddly-squat about the network if you don’t 
write it down somewhere? Write down everything, put it in an official binder 
labeled Network Bible, and protect the binder as if it were sacred.
Your hope should be that 2,000 years from now, when archeologists are 
exploring caves in your area, they find your network documentation hidden 
in a jar and marvel at how meticulously the people of our time recorded their 
network configurations.
They’ll probably draw ridiculous conclusions, such as we offered sacrifices of 
burnt data packets to a deity named TCP/IP and confessed our transgressions 
in a ritual known as “logging,” but that makes it all the more fun.

Ten Big Network Mistakes
J

ust about the time you figure out how to avoid the most embarrassing 
computer mistakes (such as using your CD drive’s tray as a cup holder), 
the network lands on your computer. Now you have a whole new list of dumb 
things you can do, mistakes that can give your average computer geek a belly 
laugh because they seem so basic to him. Well, that’s because he’s a computer 
geek. Nobody had to tell him not to fold the floppy disk — he was born with 
an extra gene that gave him an instinctive knowledge of such things.
Here’s a list of some of the most common mistakes made by network novices. 
Avoid these mistakes and you deprive your local computer geek of the pleasure 
of a good laugh at your expense.
Skimping on Cable
If your network consists of more than a few computers or has computers 
located in different rooms, invest in a professional-quality cable installation, 
complete with wall-mounted jacks, patch panels, and high-quality network 
switches. It’s tempting to cut costs by using cheap switches and by stringing 
inexpensive cable directly from the switches to each computer on the net­
work. In the long run, though, the Scrooge approach may actually prove to be 
more expensive than investing in a good cable installation in the first place.
Here are just a few of the reasons it pays to do the cabling right in the first place:
	
✓	A good cable installation lasts much longer than the computers it services. 
A good cable installation can last 10 or 15 years, long after the computers 
on your network have been placed on display in a computer history 
museum.
	
✓	Installing cable is hard work. No one enjoys going up in the attic, poking 
his head up through ceiling panels and wiping fiberglass insulation out 
of his or her hair, or fishing cables through walls. If you’re going to do it, 
do it right so you don’t have to do it again in just a few years. Build your 
cable installation to last.
	
✓	Your network users may be satisfied with 100 Mbps networking now, but 
it won’t be long before they demand gigahertz speed. And who knows 
how fast the next wave of networking will be? If you cut costs by using 

406
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
plain Cat5 cable instead of more expensive Cat6 cable, you’ll have to 
replace it later.
	
✓	You might be tempted to skip the modular wall jacks and patch cables 
and instead just run the cable down the wall, out through a hole, and then 
directly to the computer or hub. That’s a bad idea because the connec­
tors are the point at which cables are most likely to fail. If a connector fails, 
you have to replace the entire cable — all the way up the wall, through the 
ceiling, and back to the switch. By wiring in a wall-jack and using a patch 
cable, you have to replace only the patch cable when a connector fails.
For more information about professional touches for installing cable, see 
Chapter 5.
Turning Off or Restarting a Server 
Computer While Users Are Logged On
The fastest way to blow your network users’ accounts to kingdom come is to 
turn off a server computer while users are logged on. Restarting it by press­
ing its reset button can have the same disastrous effect.
If your network is set up with a dedicated file server, you probably won’t be 
tempted to turn it off or restart it. But if your network is set up as a true peer-
to-peer network, where each of the workstation computers — including your 
own — also doubles as a server computer, be careful about the impulsive 
urge to turn off or restart your computer. Someone may be accessing a file or 
printer on your computer at that very moment.
So, before you turn off or restart a server computer, find out whether anyone 
is logged on. If so, politely ask her to log off.
	
Many server problems don’t require a server reboot. Instead, you can often 
correct the problem just by restarting the particular service that’s affected.
Deleting Important Files on the Server
Without a network, you can do anything you want to your computer, and the 
only person you can hurt is yourself. (Kind of like the old “victimless crime” 
debate.) Put your computer on a network, though, and you take on a certain 
amount of responsibility. You must find out how to live like a responsible 
member of the network society.
Therefore, you can’t capriciously delete files from a network server just 
because you don’t need them. They may not be yours. You wouldn’t want 
someone deleting your files, would you?

407
 Chapter 28: Ten Big Network Mistakes
Be especially careful about files that are required to keep the network running. 
For example, some versions of Windows use a folder named wgpo0000 to hold 
e-mail. If you delete this folder, your e-mail is history. Look before you delete.
	
The first time you accidentally delete an important file from a network share, 
you may be unpleasantly surprised to discover that the Recycle Bin does not 
work for network files. The Recycle Bin saves copies of files you’ve deleted from 
your computer’s local hard disk, but it does not save copies of files you delete 
from network shares. As a result, you can’t undelete a file you’ve accidentally 
deleted from the network.
Copying a File from the Server, Changing 
It, and Then Copying It Back
Sometimes working on a network file is easier if you first copy the file to your 
local hard drive. Then you can access it from your application program more 
efficiently because you don’t have to use the network. This is especially true 
for large database files that have to be sorted to print reports.
You’re asking for trouble, though, if you copy the file to your PC’s local hard 
drive, make changes to the file, and then copy the updated version of the file 
back to the server. Why? Because somebody else may be trying the same 
thing at the same time. If that happens, the updates made by one of you — 
whoever copies the file back to the server first — are lost.
Copying a file to a local drive is rarely a good idea.
Sending Something to the Printer Again 
Just Because It Didn’t Print the First Time
What do you do if you send something to the printer and nothing happens?
	
✓	Right answer: Find out why nothing happened and fix it.
	
✓	Wrong answer: Send it again and see whether it works this time.
	
	Some users keep sending it over and over again, hoping that one of 
these days, it’ll take. The result is rather embarrassing when someone 
finally clears the paper jam and then watches 30 copies of the same 
letter print. Or when 30 copies of your document print on a different 
printer because you had the wrong printer selected.

408
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Assuming That the Server 
Is Safely Backed Up
Some users make the unfortunate assumption that the network somehow 
represents an efficient and organized bureaucracy worthy of their trust. This 
is far from the truth. Never assume that the network jocks are doing their 
jobs backing up the network data every day, even if they are. Check up on 
them. Conduct a surprise inspection one day: Burst into the computer room 
wearing white gloves and demand to see the backup tapes. Check the tape 
rotation to make sure that more than one day’s worth of backups is available.
If you’re not impressed with your network’s backup procedures, take it upon 
yourself to make sure that you never lose any of your data. Back up your 
most valued files to a flash drive.
Connecting to the Internet without 
Considering Security Issues
If you connect a non-networked computer to the Internet and then pick up 
a virus or get yourself hacked into, only that one computer is affected. But 
if you connect a networked computer to the Internet, the entire network 
becomes vulnerable.
	
Beware: Never connect a networked computer to the Internet without first 
considering the security issues:
	
✓	How will you protect yourself and the network from viruses?
	
✓	How will you ensure that the sensitive files located on your file server 
don’t suddenly become accessible to the entire world?
	
✓	How can you prevent evil hackers from sneaking into your network, 
stealing your customer file, and selling your customer’s credit card data 
on the black market?
	
For answers to these and other Internet-security questions, see Chapter 23.

 Chapter 28: Ten Big Network Mistakes
Plugging In a Wireless Access 
Point without Asking
For that matter, plugging any device into your network without first getting 
permission from the network administrator is a big no-no. But wireless access 
points (WAPs) are particularly insidious. Many users fall for the marketing 
line that wireless networking is as easy as plugging in one of these devices 
to the network. Then, your wireless notebook PC or handheld device can 
instantly join the network.
The trouble is, so can anyone else within about one-quarter mile of the WAP. 
Therefore, you must employ extra security measures to make sure hackers 
can’t get into your network via a wireless computer located in the parking lot 
or across the street.
If you think that’s unlikely, think again. Several underground Web sites on the 
Internet actually display maps of unsecured wireless networks in major cities. 
For more information about securing a wireless network, see Chapter 9.
Thinking You Can’t Work Just 
Because the Network Is Down
A few years back, I realized that I can’t do my job without electricity. Should 
a power failure occur and I find myself without electricity, I can’t even light a 
candle and work with pencil and paper because the only pencil sharpener I 
have is electric.
Some people have the same attitude about the network: They figure that if the 
network goes down, they may as well go home. That’s not always the case. Just 
because your computer is attached to a network doesn’t mean that it won’t 
work when the network is down. True — if the wind flies out of the network 
sails, you can’t access any network devices. You can’t get files from network 
drives, and you can’t print on network printers. But you can still use your com­
puter for local work — accessing files and programs on your local hard drive 
and printing on your local printer (if you’re lucky enough to have one).

410
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Running Out of Space on a Server
One of the most disastrous mistakes to make on a network server is to let it 
run out of disk space. When you buy a new server with hundreds of gigabytes 
of disk space, you might think you’ll never run out of space. It’s amazing how 
quickly an entire network full of users can run through a few hundred giga­
bytes of disk space, though.
Unfortunately, bad things begin to happen when you get down to a few giga­
bytes of free space on a server. Windows begins to perform poorly and may 
even slow to a crawl. Errors start popping up. And, when you finally run out 
of space completely, users line up at your door demanding an immediate fix:
	
✓	The best way to avoid this unhappy situation is to monitor the free disk 
space on your servers on a daily basis. It’s also a good idea to keep track 
of free disk space on a weekly basis so you can look for project trends. 
For example, if your file server has 100GB of free space and your users 
chew up about 5GB of space per week, you know you’ll most likely run 
out of disk space in 20 weeks. With that knowledge in hand, you can 
formulate a plan.
	
✓	Adding additional disk storage to your servers isn’t always the best solu­
tion to the problem of running out of disk space. Before you buy more 
disks, you should
 
• Look for old and unnecessary files that can be removed.
 
• Consider using disk quotas to limit the amount of network disk 
space your users can consume.
Always Blaming the Network
Some people treat the network kind of like the village idiot who can be 
blamed whenever anything goes wrong. Networks cause problems of their 
own, but they aren’t the root of all evil:
	
✓	If your monitor displays only capital letters, it’s probably because you 
pressed the Caps Lock key.
	
	Don’t blame the network.
	
✓	If you spill coffee on the keyboard, well, that’s your fault.
	
	Don’t blame the network.
	
✓	If your toddler sticks Play-Doh in the floppy drive, kids will be kids.
	
	Don’t blame the network.
Get the point?

Ten Things You Should 
Keep in Your Closet
W

hen you first network your office computers, you need to find a closet 
where you can stash some network goodies. If you can’t find a whole 
closet, shoot for a shelf, a drawer, or at least a sturdy cardboard box.
Here’s a list of what stuff to keep on hand.
Duct Tape
Duct tape helped get the crew of Apollo 13 back from their near-disastrous 
moon voyage. You won’t actually use it much to maintain your network, 
but it serves the symbolic purpose of demonstrating that you realize things 
sometimes go wrong and you’re willing to improvise to get your network up 
and running.
If you don’t like duct tape, a little baling wire and some chewing gum serve 
the same symbolic purpose.
Tools
Make sure that you have at least a basic computer toolkit, the kind you can 
pick up for $15 from just about any office supply store. At the minimum, 
you’ll need a good set of screwdrivers, plus wire cutters, wire strippers, and 
cable crimpers for assembling RJ-45 connectors.

412
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Patch Cables
Keep a good supply of patch cables on hand. You’ll use them often: when 
you move users around from one office to another, when you add computers 
to your network, or when you need to rearrange things at the patch panels 
(assuming you wired your network using patch panels).
When you buy patch cables, buy them in a variety of lengths and colors. One 
good way to quickly make a mess of your patch panels is to use 15' cables 
when 3' cables will do the job. And having a variety of colors can help you 
sort out a mass of cables.
	
The last place you should buy patch cables is from one of those big-box office 
supply or consumer electronics stores. Instead, get them online. Cables that 
sell for $15 or $20 each at chain stores can be purchased online for $3 or $4 
each.
Cable Ties
Cable ties — those little plastic zip things that you wrap around a group of 
cables and pull to tighten — can go a long way toward helping keep your net­
work cables neat and organized. You can buy them in bags of 1,000 at big-box 
home-improvement stores.
Twinkies
If left sealed in their little individually wrapped packages, Twinkies keep for 
years. In fact, they’ll probably outlast the network itself. You can bequeath 
them to future network geeks, ensuring continued network support for gen­
erations to come.
In November of 2012, computer geeks throughout the world faced a crisis 
far more menacing than the end of the Mayan calendar: the possible end of 
Hostess and Twinkies. Fortunately, the gods intervened, and Twinkies were 
saved, thus ensuring the continued operation of computer networks through­
out the globe.

413
 Chapter 29: Ten Things You Should Keep in Your Closet
Extra Network Cards
Ideally, nearly all your computers will have network interfaces built directly into 
the motherboard. However, you will occasionally find that the motherboard’s 
network interface goes bad. Rather than replace the entire motherboard, you 
can often fix the problem by adding a cheap (less than $20) network card to 
use instead of the on-board network interface.
Cheap Network Switches
Keep a couple of inexpensive (about $20) four- or eight-port network switches 
on hand. You don’t want to use them for your main network infrastructure, but 
they sure come in handy when you need to add a computer or printer some­
where, and you don’t have an available network jack. For example, suppose 
one of your users has a short-term need for a second computer, but there’s 
only one network jack in the user’s office. Rather than pulling a new cable to 
the user’s office, just plug a cheap switch into the existing jack and then plug 
both of the computers into the switch.
The Complete Documentation of the 
Network on Tablets of Stone
I mention several times in this book the importance of documenting your net­
work. Don’t spend hours documenting your network and then hide the docu­
mentation under a pile of old magazines behind your desk. Put the binder 
in the closet with the other network supplies so that you and everyone else 
always know where to find it. And keep backup copies of the Word, Excel, 
Visio, or other documents that make up the network binder in a fireproof safe 
or at another site.
	
Don’t you dare chisel passwords into the network documentation, though. 
Shame on you for even thinking about it!
	
If you decide to chisel the network documentation onto actual stone tablets, 
consider using sandstone. It’s attractive, inexpensive, and easy to update (just 
rub out the old info and chisel in the new). Keep in mind, however, that sand­
stone is subject to erosion from spilled Diet Coke. Oh, and make sure that you 
store it on a reinforced shelf.

414
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
The Network Manuals and Disks
In the Land of Oz, a common lament of the Network Scarecrow is, “If I only 
had the manual.” True, the manual probably isn’t a Pulitzer Prize candidate, 
but that doesn’t mean you should toss it in a landfill, either.
	
Put the manuals and disks for all the software you use on your network where 
they belong — in the closet with all the other network tools and artifacts.
Ten Copies of This Book
Obviously, you want to keep an adequate supply of this book on hand to 
distribute to all your network users. The more they know, the more they stay 
off your back.
Sheesh, 10 copies may not be enough — 20 may be closer to what you need.
