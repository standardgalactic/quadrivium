Preface
This book is written to address a number of issues that currently are not addressed 
by other books on the topics of mobile computing and communications. I have 
taught a mobile computing course for a few years and have come across a number 
of books that discuss wireless network technologies and infrastructures, and books 
that focus on tools and software to develop mobile applications. What I find missing 
in these books is a discussion on how developing mobile computing applications are 
different from developing conventional applications, the issues and constraints that 
need to be addressed, and why mobile applications are different from conventional 
applications. This book is my attempt at addressing those shortcomings.
Another difficulty that I encountered when teaching this subject is that most 
books on wireless networks are written for engineering students. Adopting the 
material for computer science students is quite a task. That is another reason for 
this book—it is written specifically for computer science students and people from 
a computer or information technology background.
Overview of the Book
This book can be used as a textbook for a mobile computing course (introductory 
or intermediate). It is targeted at second- or third-year undergraduate computer sci-
ence students, but can also be used as a reference book for a postgraduate course. It 
assumes that readers have a basic knowledge of computer communication networks. 
If enough time and motivation exist, the reader is advised to go through the entire 
book cover to cover. Otherwise, the reader may choose topics of interest. The book is 
written so that the chapters are independent of each other. It is organized as follows.
Chapter 1 gives an overview of what mobile computing has to offer and how 
mobile applications will eventually change the way we work and live. It describes 
Mark Weiser’s vision of a ubiquitous computing environment and proceeds to give 
examples of mobile applications in different fields followed by a section that gives an 
overview of the evolution of wireless networks and services.

x  Preface
The next five chapters discuss the underlying network technologies required to 
support such applications.
Chapters 2–6 focus on the technologies and infrastructure of the following 
wireless networks: cellular networks, wireless local area networks, personal area 
networks, sensor networks, and mobile ad hoc networks. Each chapter discusses the 
relevant standards and services supported by the standard. The security issues related 
to each network are also explored. Chapter 2 gives a fundamental understanding of 
the wireless network infrastructure and protocols. Chapters 3–6 can be read inde-
pendently of each other without affecting understanding of later chapters.
Chapter 7 explains why existing Internet protocols are unsuitable for mobility 
support and proceeds to discuss the Mobile IP standard that was designed to sup-
port roaming users. In addition to registration messages, routing, and tunneling, 
this chapter also discusses how security is addressed in Mobile IP by extending it 
to support accounting, authentication, and authorization services. This chapter is 
optional.
Chapter 8 is fundamental to understanding mobile computing issues. It dis-
cusses various issues and why these must be considered when developing mobile 
applications. The objective is to highlight the differences between developing desk-
top and mobile applications. Among issues presented are adaptive behavior, power 
management, resource constraints, interface design, and seamless mobility support. 
The Odyssey, Spectra, and Aura projects are among examples used to illustrate the 
complexity of designing and developing smart mobile applications.
Chapter 9 focuses on location-sensing techniques and systems. It explains why 
identifying a user’s location is important to delivering context-sensitive informa-
tion. After defining key terms, it discusses three location-sensing techniques fol-
lowed by a brief taxonomy of location systems. The remaining sections present 
case studies of the implementation of location systems in a hospital and a tracking 
application.
Finally, Chapter 10 discusses security issues that have not been covered in previ-
ous chapters.
In each chapter, relevant case studies are used as examples so that the reader can 
better understand the practical aspects and how a problem is addressed. Reference, 
bibliography, and online resource lists are provided at the end of each chapter so 
that readers may further explore the topic. I hope readers will find this book inter-
esting and useful.
Acronyms
The telecommunications field is famous for its notorious use of acronyms. A list of 
acronyms used in this book is provided to help minimize confusion.

Chapter 1
Introduction
The most familiar aspect of mobile computing technology is the hand phone. 
About two decades ago, a hand phone was bulky and was only used for voice com-
munication. It was merely an extension of the fixed line telephony that allowed 
users to keep in touch with colleagues. Now the hand phone is not only used for 
voice communication, it is also used to send text and multimedia messages. Future 
mobile devices will not only enable Internet access, but will also support high-speed 
data services.
In addition to the hand phone, various types of mobile devices are now avail-
able, for example, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and pocket personal computers 
(PCs). Road warriors use mobile devices to access up-to-date information from the 
corporate database. A police officer at a crime scene may send a fingerprint picked 
up there for matching with data in a central database through a wireless network, 
hence leading to faster identification and arrest of potential suspects. The global 
positioning system (GPS) is used in search and rescue missions, for monitoring and 
preservation of wildlife, and for vehicle theft prevention. Though many of us are 
unaware of when mobile computing technology is being used, it has permeated all 
aspects of our lives.
What is mobile computing? Simply defined, it is the use of a wireless network 
infrastructure to provide anytime, anywhere communications and access to infor-
mation. There are many aspects of mobile computing and, sometimes, different 
terms are used to refer to them. This chapter gives an overview of what mobile 
computing has to offer and how it improves the quality of our lives. Later chapters 
discuss the underlying wireless networks and technologies that make mobile com-
puting applications possible.

2  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
1.1	
Mobile Computing Applications
In 1991, Mark Weiser envisioned the next-generation computer technologies that 
“weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable 
from it.” He described a ubiquitous computing environment that enhances the 
environment by making many computers available throughout the physical realm, 
while making them effectively invisible to the user. Weiser pointed out that anthro-
pological studies of work life showed that people primarily work in a world of 
shared situations and unexamined technological skills. Today’s computer technol-
ogy does not conform to this description because it remains the focus of attention 
instead of being a tool that disappears from users’ awareness. Ubiquitous comput-
ing aims to make computers widely available throughout users’ environments and 
effortless to use. In other words, users should be able to work with computing 
devices without having to acquire the technological skills to use them. Computers 
are integrated into their environments so that users are not even aware that they are 
using a computer to accomplish a task. Unlike the computer technology of today, 
users need not acquire specific skills to use computers because their use would be 
intuitive. The aim of ubiquitous computing is to create a new relationship between 
people and computers in which the computers are kept out of the way of users as 
they go about their lives.
Instead of computers that sit passively on desks, ubiquitous computers are aware 
of their surroundings and locations. They come in different sizes, each tailored to 
a specific task. At the Xerox Lab, Weiser and his colleagues developed a tab that is 
analogous to a Post-it® note, a pad that is analogous to a sheet of paper, and a board 
that is analogous to a yard-scale display. An office may contain hundreds of tabs, 
tens of pads, and one or two boards. These devices are not personal computers, but 
are a pervasive part of everyday life, with users often having many units in simulta-
neous operation. Unlike a laptop or a notebook, which is associated with a particular 
user, tabs and pads can be grabbed and used anywhere—they have no individual-
ized identity and importance. You may have a few pads on your desk, each dedicated 
to a particular task in the same way that you spread papers on your desk.
An employee ID card is replaced by an active badge that is of the same size. It 
identifies itself to receivers placed throughout a building. It makes it possible to 
keep track of people and objects that it is attached to. Because an active badge is 
associated to a particular user, it can become a form of ID; for example, an elec-
tronic door to a restricted area would only open to authorized users. When I am 
not in my office, the system detects my current location and forwards phone calls 
there. When I walk into a lecture hall, the system detects my presence, checks the 
timetable, deduces that I am there for a WRES3405 lecture, and automatically 
downloads that day’s lecture notes. When the system detects the presence of a team 
working on a particular project in a meeting room, it checks the room booking sys-
tem to determine if there is a scheduled meeting. Confirming that it is indeed the 
case, it downloads and displays the previous minutes on the board. As the meeting 

Introduction  3
progresses, team members may manipulate the board using a tetherless pen that 
need not touch the screen, but can operate from a few meters away. Using the pen, 
a team member may point to an object on the board, select it, and modify it.
Pervasive computing is a term that is synonymous with ubiquitous comput-
ing. Many interesting projects on pervasive computing are carried out at Carnegie-
Mellon University. The Portable Help Desk (PHD) is an application developed 
under Project Aura that makes use of spatial (a user’s relative and absolute position 
and orientation) and temporal (scheduled time of private and public events) aware-
ness. PHD allows a user to determine the location of colleagues and information 
about them. It is equipped with the capability to display maps of surrounding areas, 
indicating resources and nearby people. It also notifies users of the availability of 
resources they may need, for example, a nearby printer or café. PHD is equipped 
with visual and audio interfaces, each of which provides support in different con-
texts; for example, a user who is walking is more likely to prefer an audio interface 
to interact with PHD.
An important requirement of the applications discussed so far is that for them 
to offer relevant information to the user (e.g., a café is about 100 m to your left), 
they need to be aware of their context. This is a very important aspect of mobile 
computing applications. To be useful, an application needs to be aware of its cur-
rent environment. For example, if I am currently in Kuching and I request informa-
tion about seafood restaurants, I expect the application to give me a list of seafood 
restaurants in Kuching, not Kuala Lumpur. For this reason, a tourist guide applica-
tion must have context awareness embedded so that it can deliver information that 
is relevant to the users.
HyperAudio and HIPS (Petrelli et al. 2001) are handheld electronic museum 
guides that adapt their behavior to that of a visitor. A visitor to a museum is given 
a handheld device equipped with headphones. As the visitor approaches an exhibit, 
the system dynamically composes a presentation of the object in sight. When the 
system detects that a visitor pauses in front of a display, it presents information about 
it. The information is presented in the form of audio recording, a relevant image, 
and a set of links for obtaining more information about it. The system obtains an 
estimate of the distance between the visitor and the display and adapts the way the 
information is presented. For example, if it detects that the visitor is standing right 
in front of the display, the audio message would say, “this item is. . . .” If the visitor 
is a distance away, it may attract his attention to it by saying, “the display in front 
of you . . .” or “the display to your left is. . . .” The system deduces that the visitor is 
very interested in the display if he or she pauses in front of it for more than a certain 
period of time and proceeds to present more detailed information about it. As the 
visitor moves away to view another display, the system detects the distance between 
the current display and the next one and starts to download the presentation for 
the next display.
Another class of information that makes use of wireless technology is wear-
able computing, which involves integrating computers into our clothes to perform 

4  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
certain functions, for example, monitor the wearer’s heartbeat and blood pressure. 
There are many practical and useful applications of wearable computing. Guide 
dogs and canes are very useful in assisting visually impaired people to avoid obsta-
cles and negotiate changes in ground level, such as steps. However, they are not 
helpful in avoiding higher obstacles such as street signs and tree branches. This dif-
ficulty may be overcome with the use of a wearable headset consisting of a laptop, 
a video camera with infrared (IR) light emitting diodes mounted on one side of an 
eyeglass frame, and a scanning fiber display and optics mounted in a tube. The soft-
ware comprises a machine vision program that identifies potential collision objects, 
a program that controls the display, and a graphical user interface (GUI) to help set 
parameters for the embedded processors and generate bright warning icons.
A more recent technology is a wireless sensor network (WSN). In a WSN, sen-
sors are placed at strategic locations to monitor certain aspects of the environment. 
For example, biologists may use it for habitat monitoring to study behavioral pat-
terns of a species. The use of sensor networks assists ecologists to accurately measure 
the degree of microenvironmental variance that organisms experience (Szewczyk et 
al. 2004). Data collected by scientists regarding population dynamics and habitat 
needs is important in conservation biology, landscape monitoring and manage-
ment, and species-recovery efforts. Sensor nodes are also used to monitor personnel 
and mobile assets; for example, an alarm is triggered when a printer is detected leav-
ing an office area without authorization. One application of this technology is in 
agriculture, where sensors are used to monitor environmental conditions that may 
affect the crop. Early detection and alert of a change in temperature, for example, 
would help farmers to take precautionary steps to protect their crops.
Another novel invention using wireless technology is the virtual fence (Mur-
ray 2004). Cowboys on horsebacks herding cattle might one day become a feature 
of a bygone era as the introduction of virtual fences allows ranchers to herd their 
cattle from the comfort of their homes. The virtual fence is downloaded to the cows 
by transmitting GPS coordinates to head collars worn by the cows. The dynamic 
virtual fences are moved along desired trajectories. The collars are equipped with a 
wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networking card, a Zaurus PDA, an eTrex GPS unit, and 
a loudspeaker that transmits occurring sounds (e.g., roaring tigers, barking dogs) 
when a cow strays from the intended path. This multidisciplinary project, the brain 
child of a biologist, is made possible in collaboration with computer scientists.
Sensor technology can potentially play an important role in search and res-
cue operations by first responders (i.e., emergency personnel), such as firefighters, 
paramedics, and police, who arrive at the scene immediately after an event (e.g., 
a fire, an earthquake, a building collapse) occurs. Firefighters wear tags to allow 
easy tracking of their movements to coordinate search and rescue operations more 
effectively. The firefighters can be informed if a particular section of a building is 
found to be unstable and is about to collapse, and they are directed to evacuate it 
immediately. A wireless vital sign monitor is attached to victims found trapped so 
that their condition can be monitored to ensure that they receive the appropriate 

Introduction  5
medical attention as soon as they are rescued. This noninvasive sensor monitors 
vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, and serum chemistry measure-
ments. The vital sign monitor helps the paramedic team determine which victims’ 
conditions are more critical so that they can prioritize medical attention to more 
severely injured victims. The application and architecture required to support this 
emergency response application is being developed under the CodeBlue project at 
Harvard University.
Wireless technology is also used in healthcare. The Arrhythmia Monitoring 
System (AMS) is a medical telemetry (telemedicine) system that makes use of wire-
less technology to monitor patients suffering from arrhythmia (Liszka et al. 2004). 
Among the complications that arise from arrhythmia are the loss of regular heart-
beat and subsequent loss of function and rapid heartbeats. AMS provides a means 
for healthcare professionals to continuously monitor a patient’s electrical cardiac 
rhythms remotely even though the patient is not at the hospital. This technol-
ogy allows patients to be in the comfort of their homes without jeopardizing their 
health. It is also useful for monitoring the heart functions of astronauts who are 
more susceptible to cardiac dysrhythmias when in space.
The system architecture consists of a wearable server, a central server, and a call 
center. The wearable server is a small communications device worn by the patient 
that collects the patient’s electrocardiogram ([ECG], i.e., the heart muscles’ electri-
cal activity). The data is collected using wires attached to skin-contact biosensors. 
The wearable server receives analog signals from the sensors and converts them into 
digital signals. Data is collected every 4 ms and requires a minimum baud rate of 
22.5 kbps to transmit over a wireless link to the central server.
The central server is located close to the patient. Its functions are data compres-
sion, location awareness utilizing GPS, and rudimentary arrhythmia detection. It 
serves as a wireless gateway to a long-distance cellular network. Data is routed via 
the call center that is manned 24/7, by healthcare professionals who monitor the 
ECG signals and respond to alerts. The system transmits an alert automatically if it 
detects that the patient is about to have or is having an arrhythmia attack. A patient 
can press a button on the wearable server to send a noncritical alert to the call center 
if the heart flutters or other unusual feeling occurs. There is also a panic button that 
a patient can press to send a critical alert for help so that an emergency response 
team can be rushed to the most recent GPS location.
The GPS location service is a critical part of the system as it is imperative that 
an emergency response team is dispatched in the quickest time possible. A patient’s 
location is tracked using a GPS transceiver equipped with a 1.55 GHz GPS antenna 
and a 2.4 GHz Bluetooth antenna. The location information is sent to the receiver 
every 10 s and acquires a minimum of three GSP satellite signals. A patient’s loca-
tion can be accurately tracked within 10 m.
Another category of mobile applications that is gaining popularity is mobile 
commerce or m-commerce, which is likely to become an important application of 

6  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
this technology. M-commerce application can be classified into 10 types (Varshney 
and Vetter 2002):
	
1.	Mobile financial application (business-to-customer [B2C] and business-to-
business [B2B]): The mobile device is used as a powerful financial medium.
	
2.	Mobile advertising (B2C): It turns the wireless infrastructure and devices 
into a powerful marketing medium.
	
3.	Mobile inventory management (B2C and B2B) or product locating and shop-
ping (B2C and B2B): It is an attempt to reduce the amount of inventory needed 
by managing in-house and on-the-move inventory. It also includes applications 
that help to locate products and services that are needed.
	
4.	Proactive service management (B2C and B2B): It attempts to locate products 
and services that are needed.
	
5.	Wireless reengineering (B2C and B2B): It focuses on improving the quality 
of business services using mobile devices and wireless infrastructure.
	
6.	Mobile auction or reverse auction (B2C and B2B): It allows users to buy or 
sell certain items using multicast support of wireless infrastructure.
	
7.	Mobile entertainment services and games (B2C): It provides entertainment 
services to users on a per-event or subscription basis.
	
8.	Mobile office (B2C): It provides the complete office environment to mobile 
users anywhere, anytime.
	
9.	Mobile distance education (B2C): It extends distance or virtual education 
support for mobile uses everywhere.
	 10.	Wireless data center (B2C and B2B): It supports large amounts of stored data 
to be made available to mobile users for making “intelligent” decisions.
The mobile computing applications discussed so far provide a glimpse of what 
mobile computing technology has to offer. The applications are used in many dif-
ferent fields and may perform generic functions or be tailored to specific needs. The 
next section gives an overview the evolution of wireless networks that have made 
these applications possible.
1.2	
Evolution of Wireless Networks and Services
The first generation (1G) wireless network was analog. The first in North America 
was advanced mobile phone system (AMPS), which was based on frequency divi-
sion multiple access. A total of 1664 channels were available in the 824 to 849 MHz 
and 869 to 894 MHz band, providing 832 downlink (DL) and 832 uplink (UL) 
channels. AMPS, widely used in North America, supports frequency reuse. The 
underlying network is a cellular network where a geographical region is divided 
into cells. A base station (BS) at the center of the cell transmits signals to and from 
users within the cell.

Introduction  7
The second generation (2G) systems onward are digital. Digital systems make 
possible an array of new services such as caller ID. The Global System for Mobile 
Communications (GSM) is a popular 2G system. GSM offers a data rate of 9.6 to 
14.4 kbps. It supports international roaming, which means users may have access 
to wireless services even when traveling abroad. The most popular service offered by 
GSM is the Short Message Service (SMS), which allows users to send text messages 
up to 160 characters long.
2.5G systems support more than just voice communications. In addition to 
text messaging, 2.5G systems offer a data rate on the order of 100 kbps to support 
various data technologies, such as Internet access. Most 2.5G systems implement 
packet switching. The 2.5G systems help provide seamless transition technology 
between 2G and third generation (3G) systems. The following are 2.5G systems:
High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD): Even though most 2.5G sys-
N
N
tems implement packet switching, HSCSD continues support for circuit-
switched data. It offers a data rate of 115 kbps and is designed to enhance 
GSM networks. The access technology used is time division multiple access 
(TDMA). It provides support for Web browsing and file transfers.
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS): GPRS offers a data rate of 168 kbps. It

enhances the performance and transmission speeds of GSM. GPRS provides 
always-on connectivity, which means users do not have to reconnect to the 
network for each transmission. Because there is a maximum of eight slots 
to transmit calls on one device, it allows more than one transmission at one 
time; for example, a voice call and an incoming text message can be handled 
simultaneously.
Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE): EDGE works in con-
N
N
junction with GPRS and TDMA over GSM networks. Its offered data rate 
is 384 kbps. EDGE supports data communications while voice communica-
tions are supported using the technology on existing networks.
The third-generation (3G) wireless systems are designed to support high bit 
rate telecommunications. 3G systems are designed to meet the requirements of 
multimedia applications and Internet services. The bit rate offered ranges from 144 
kbps for full mobility applications, 384 kbps for limited mobility applications in 
macro- and microcellular environments, and 2 Mbps for low-mobility applications 
in micro- and picocellular environments. A very useful service provided by 3G sys-
tems is an emergency service with the ability to identify a user’s location within 125 
m 67% of time. Figure 1.1 shows the evolution of wireless standards.
Initially, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) intended to design 
a single 3G standard; however, due to a number of difficulties, it has ratified two 
3G standards. The two standards are CDMA2000, which provides a bit rate of up 
to 2.4 Mbps, and wideband CDMA (WCDMA), which provides a bit rate of up to 

8  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
8 Mbps. The high bit rate enables new wireless services that can be classified into 
three categories:
	
1.	Information retrieval: It permits location-aware applications to remotely 
download information from a corporate database.
	
2.	Mobile commerce: It allows users to book a flight or pay bills.
	
3.	General communication: It permits users to make or receive phone calls, send 
or receive messages, or activate an air conditioner at home.
Compound wireless service enables users to combine different types of services 
to carry out specialized functions. For example, you can take a photo using a cam-
era phone and send it to a friend using the multimedia message service (MMS). A 
more useful application would be to combine a home alarm system with a wireless 
service so that when an intruder is detected, a photo of the intruder is captured by 
the surveillance camera and sent to the authorities, while the owner is alerted via 
mobile phone.
A compound service comprises a fundamental wireless service (one that cannot 
be partitioned into smaller identifiable services), a utility service (one that carries out 
a function within a particular compound service sequence), and possibly another 
compound service. For example, consider a courier service driver who has to deliver 
a document before a certain deadline and he has to find the fastest and least con-
gested route to his destination. He makes use of a route planning application on the 
wireless terminal in his van, which consists of three fundamental wireless services:
	
1.	A location service to determine the current location of the driver.
	
2.	A travel route computation to determine the least congested and fastest route 
to his destination.

3.	Traffic information retrieval to obtain traffic information from various 
sources.
The compound service consists of continuous iterations of these services: deter-
mine the current location and provide it to the wireless terminal, compute the least 
congested route from the current location to the destination, and retrieve the most 
updated traffic information. It involves executing step 1 and deciding whether to 
repeat step 2. Going back to step 1 is the utility service.

Summary
Mobile computing is an active area of research. Most applications available to users 
today are targeted at teenagers and yuppies and are mostly infotainment applica-
tions, for example, music downloads, friend locators, news updates. It will probably 
be a few more years before mobile enterprise applications appear on the market as 
there are many issues that need to be addressed to efficiently and effectively provide 
such applications. For this reason, several examples discussed in this book are based 
on ongoing and experimental work at various universities and research institutes. 
Therefore, a list of references, bibliographies, and online resources are provided at 
the end of each chapter so that readers may further explore the topic.

Cellular Network 
Architecture
When you subscribe to a mobile telephony service, your information is stored in a 
database called a home location register (HLR). The HLR plays an important role 
in providing you with the services offered by your service provider. In this chapter, 
you will learn about the cellular network architecture and the protocols involved in 
providing various services.
In a cellular network, a geographical region is divided into service areas called 
“cells.” A cell is represented as a hexagon (Figure 2.1). At the center of a cell, is a 
base transceiver station (BTS) that serves users within the cell. A cluster of BTSs 
forms what is termed as Node B. Each cell is allocated a certain number of channels 
operating at a certain frequency. Channels used for transmission from the BTS to 
a mobile station (MS) are termed forward channels, and channels for transmis-
sion from a MS to a BTS are termed reverse channels. A few of these channels 
are reserved to send control data, for example, registration requests, call requests, 
authentications, paging to find a mobile user. A reverse control channel (RCC) and 
a forward control channel (FCC) are examples of channels used for transmission 
of control data.
A cellular network consists of a hierarchy of the following entities (Figure 2.2):
MS: It is a device used to communicate in the cellular network, for example, 
■
■
a mobile phone.
Base transceiver station: It is a BS consisting of a transceiver that receives or 
N
N
transmits signals over the radio interface. It serves one cell only.

12  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
BS controller (BSC): It controls one or more BTSs and is under one mobile 
N
N
switching center (MSC).
Mobile switching center: It sets up and maintains calls made in the network. 
N
N
A MSC connects the cellular network to the fixed telephone network infra-
structure (i.e., the public switched telephone network [PSTN]). It performs all 
switching and signaling functions for MSs located in its area.
BS subsystem (BSS): It consists of one BSC and one or more BTSs. The radio 
■
■
equipment of a BSS may support one or more cells.
Each entity performs a specific function. To examine how each entity performs 
its function, consider what happens when you dial your friend’s home number. 
When you press on the call button, your mobile phone sends a call request to your 
BTS using a special channel (i.e., the RCC). The BTS forwards the request to the 
MSC. The MSC validates the request to make sure that you are authorized to use

the service and uses your friend’s number to make a connection via the PSTN. A 
switch in the PSTN sets up a connection between your MSC and your friend.
A telephone number on a PSTN contains location information that is used by 
a switch to establish a connection between two subscribers; for example, 03 7967 
6300 is the telephone number in Kuala Lumpur. On the contrary, a mobile user 
does not stay at a fixed location; hence, the mobile phone number cannot be used 
to determine a mobile user’s current location. To deliver a call to a mobile user, the 
cellular network has to determine the user’s location. The process of locating a user 
is termed paging.
Let us say that your friend dials your mobile phone number. When the request 
for connection establishment arrives at the MSC, it sends a broadcast message to 
all BSs under its control. The BSs then broadcast a paging message, which contains 
your mobile phone number, on all FCCs. Your mobile phone scans the FCC peri-
odically to check if there is a paging message for you. When it detects the paging 
message, it acknowledges its presence in the cell by sending a message on the RCC. 
When the MSC receives the acknowledgment via the BS, it instructs the BS to 
allocate an unused voice channel for you. A data message is sent on the FCC to 
your phone to instruct it to ring. When you accept the call, a connection is estab-
lished between you and your friend. When you have finished your conversation and 
hang up, the channel that was allocated to you is freed and can now be allocated 
to another user.
As you move from one location to another, the network needs to keep track of 
your location so that it can deliver calls to you. This is achieved using location reg-
istration and updates. The following sections discuss how this is achieved. We start 
by discussing the network architecture, followed by a discussion on the procedures 
and protocols required to support the services you use.
2.1	
UMTS Architecture
The Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service ([UMTS] 3GPPTS23.101 
V5.0.1 2004) is a 3G broadband, packet-based transmission of text, digitized voice, 
video, and multimedia services to mobile computer and phone users, regardless of 
their location in the world. It offers a data rate of up to 2 Mbps. Once UMTS is 
fully implemented and available, it will allow users to be constantly connected to the 
Internet as they roam, and users will have access to the same set of services and the 
same capabilities regardless of where they are.
UMTS is divided into two domains (Figure 2.3): the user equipment domain 
and the infrastructure domain. The interface between the two domains is the Uu 
reference point. The user equipment domain consists of various types of equipment 
with varying levels of functionality. The user uses a user equipment (UE) device 
to access UMTS services, such as a PDA or pocket PC. It has a radio interface to 
access the network. The user equipment domain is divided into two subdomains:

14  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
	
1.	User service identity module (USIM) domain: It contains data and proce-
dures that unambiguously and securely identify itself. Because a device is 
associated with a specific user, it allows the ID of the user. The reference 
point between the USIM and mobile equipment (ME) domains is termed 
Cu.
	
2.	ME domain: It contains applications and performs radio transmission.
The infrastructure domain is subdivided into two subdomains:
	
1.	Access network domain: It consists of physical entities that manage the 
resources of the access network. It provides users with a mechanism to access 
the core network domain. The interface between this domain and the core 
network domain is termed Iu.
	
2.	Core network domain: It consists of physical entities that provide support for 
the network features and telecommunication services (e.g., management of 
user location information, switching mechanism for signaling). It is further 
divided into three subsubdomains:
	
a.	 Serving network domain: It is where the user access to the access net-
work domain is connected. It represents the core network functions that 
are local to the user’s access point (AP) and the location changes when 
the user moves. It is responsible for routing calls and transporting user 
data or information from source to destination. It interacts with the 
home domain to cater for user-specific data or services. The interface 
between this domain and the home network domain is termed Zu. It 
interacts with the transit domain for non-user-specific data or services. 
The interface between this domain and the transit network domain is 
termed Yu.

b.	 Home network domain: It represents the core network functions that are 
conducted at a permanent location regardless of the location of the user’s 
AP. The USIM is related to this domain. It contains user-specific data and 
is responsible for the management of subscription information. It may also 
handle home-specific services not offered by the serving network domain.
	
c.	 Transit network domain: It is located on the communication path 
between the serving network domain and the remote party. If the remote 
party is located in the same network as the originating UE, no instance 
of the transit domain is activated.
2.1.1	 UMTS Strata
Four UMTS strata are defined: transport stratum, serving stratum, home stra-
tum, and application stratum. The home stratum involves domains shown in Fig-
ure 2.4, and the application stratum involves the domains shown in Figure 2.5. 
The serving and transport strata involve domains shown in both Figure 2.4 and 
Figure 2.5.
	
1.	Transport stratum: Supports the transport of user data and network control 
signaling from other strata. It also provides the mechanism for error correc-
tion and recovery, data encryption, adaptation of data to use the supported 
physical interface, and transcoding of data to more efficiently use the radio 
interface. The transport stratum includes the access stratum, which consists 
of parts of both the infrastructure and UE. The protocols between these parts 
are specific to the access technique. It provides services related to data trans-
mission over the radio interface and the management of the radio interface to 
other parts of UMTS. It includes two protocols: mobile termination–access 
network (MT-AN) and access network–serving network (AN-SN). The MT-
AN protocol supports the transfer of radio-related information to coordinate 
the use of radio resources between the MT and access network. The AN-SN 
protocol supports the access from the serving network to the resources pro-
vided by the access network.
	
2.	Serving stratum: Consists of protocols and functions to route and transmit 
user or network data from source to destination, which may be in the same or 
different networks. Telecommunication services functions are located in this 
stratum. It consists of three protocols: USIM–mobile termination (USIM-
MT), mobile termination–serving network (MT-SN), and terminal equip-
ment–mobile termination (TE-MT). The USIM-MT protocol supports access 
to subscriber-specific information to support functions in the UE domain. 
The MT-SN protocol supports access from the mobile terminal (MT) to the 
services provided by the serving network domain. The TE-MT protocol sup-
ports exchange of control information between the TE and MT.
	
3.	Home stratum: Composed of protocols and functions to handle the stor-
age of subscription data and home network–specific services. It also consists 

16  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
of functions to allow other domains to act on behalf of the home network. 
Among the functions provided are subscription data management, billing and 
charging, mobility management, and authentication. It consists of four pro-
tocols: USIM–home network (USIM-HN), USIM-MT, MT-SN, and serv-
ing network–home network (SN-HN). The USIM-HN protocol supports the 
coordination of subscriber-specific information between USIM and the home 
network. The USIM-MT protocol provides the MT access to user-specific 
data and resources required to perform action on behalf of the home network. 
The MT-SN protocol supports user-specific data exchanges between MT and 
the serving network. The SN-HN protocol provides the serving network with 
access to home network data and resources required to perform its actions on 
behalf of the home network, such as supporting user communications.
	
4.	Application stratum: Represents the application process provided to end users. 
It provides the end-to-end protocols and functions to make use of services pro-
vided by the home, serving and transport strata, and the infrastructure to sup-

port services or value-added services. The protocols and functions may be the 
ones defined by GSM/UMTS standards or may be outside the UMTS stan-
dard. End-to-end functions are applications consumed by users at the edge of 
or outside the overall network and may be accessed by authorized users.
2.1.2	 The Physical Layer
The physical layer offers services to the upper layers by defining the transport channel 
(3GPP TS25.211 V6.1.0 2004). A transport channel defines how data is transported 
over the air. It is divided into two groups: dedicated transport and common transport 
channels (Figure 2.6). There is only one type of dedicated transport channel, namely 
the dedicated channel (DCH). DCH is a downlink or uplink transport channel that 
is transmitted over the entire cell or over a part of the cell.

18  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
There are seven types of common transport channels:
	
1.	Broadcast channel (BCH): A downlink channel to broadcast system- and cell-
specific information. It is transmitted over the entire cell.
	
2.	Forward access channel (FACH): A downlink channel that is transmitted 
over the entire cell.
	
3.	Paging channel (PCH): A downlink channel that is transmitted over the 
entire cell. It is associated with the transmission of paging indicators to sup-
port efficient sleep mode procedures.
	
4.	Random access channel (RACH): An uplink channel that is received from 
the entire cell. It is characterized by a collision risk and is transmitted using 
open loop power control.
	
5.	Common packet channel (CPCH): An uplink channel associated with a 
downlink-dedicated channel that provides power control and CPCH control

command for the uplink CPCH. It is characterized by initial collision risk 
and is transmitted using inner loop power control.
	
6.	Downlink shared channel (DSCH): A downlink channel shared by several 
UEs. It is associated with one or more downlink DCHs. It is transmitted over 
the entire cell or part of the cell.
	
7.	High-speed downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH): A downlink channel 
shared by several UEs. It is associated with one downlink dedicated physi-
cal channel (DPCH) or several high-speed shared control channels (HS-
SCCHs). It is transmitted over the entire cell or part of a cell.
Transport channels are mapped to physical channels. A physical channel is 
defined by its carrier frequency, scrambling code, channelization code, duration, 
and the relative phase. Physical channels are grouped into uplink physical channels 
and downlink physical channels (Figure 2.7).
There are three types of dedicated uplink physical channels:
	
1.	Uplink dedicated physical data channel (uplink DPDCH): Used to carry the 
DCH transport channel. There may be zero, one, or more uplink DPSCHs 
on each radio link.
	
2.	Uplink dedicated physical control channel (uplink DPCCH): Used to carry 
control information generated at layer 1. The control information consists of 
pilot bits, transmission power-control commands, feedback information, and 
an optional transport-format combination indicator.

There are two types of common uplink physical channels:
	
1.	Physical random access channel (PRACH): Used to carry RACH.
	
2.	Physical common packet channel: Used to carry the CPCH.
The downlink physical channel is classified into dedicated downlink physical 
channel and the common downlink physical channel. There is only one type of 
dedicated downlink physical channel—the downlink dedicated physical channel 
(downlink DPCH). Downlink DPCH is a time multiplex of a downlink DPDCH 
and a downlink DPCCH.
There are 12 types of common downlink physical channels:
	
1.	Common pilot channel (CPICH): A fixed rate 30-kbps channel that carries 
predefined bit sequences. There are two types of CPICH: primary CPICH 
and secondary CPICH. They differ in terms of usage and the limitations 
placed on their physical features.
	
2.	Primary common control physical channel: A fixed rate channel of 30 kbps 
and is used to carry BCH.
	
3.	Secondary common control physical channel (S-CCPCH): Used to carry 
FACH and paging channel (PCH).
	
4.	Synchronization channel (SCH): A downlink signal used for cell search and 
consists of two subchannels: primary SCH and secondary SCH.
	
5.	Physical downlink shared channel: Used to carry DSCH.
	
6.	Acquisition indicator channel (AICH): A fixed rate physical channel used to 
carry acquisition indicators (AIs) that correspond to signatures on PRACH.
	
7.	CPCH access preamble acquisition indicator channel: A fixed rate physical 
channel that carries the AP acquisition indicators (API) of CPCH.
	
8.	CPCH collision detection/channel assignment indicator channel: A fixed 
rate physical channel that carries CD indicator if the CA is inactive.
	
9.	Paging indicator channel: A fixed rate physical channel that carries the pag-
ing indicators. It is associated with S-CCPCH to which a PCH transport 
channel is mapped.
	 10.	CPCH status indicator channel: A fixed rate physical channel that carries 
CPCH status information.
	 11.	Shared control channel (HS-SCCH): A fixed rate downlink physical channel 
that carries downlink signaling related to HS-DSCH transmission.
	 12.	High-speed physical downlink shared channel: Carries the HS-DSCH.

Public Land Mobile Network Interfaces
A public land mobile network (PLMN) interface performs functions as listed in 
Table 2.1. Figure 2.8 depicts the configuration and interfaces of PLMNs.

Purpose
A
MSC and 
BSS
It carries information concerning BSS management, 
call handling, and mobility management.
Abis
BSC and BTS
It supports the services offered by the network to the 
subscribers. Allows control of the radio equipment 
and RF allocation in the BTS. 
B
MSC and 
associated 
VLR
It is used by the MSC when it needs to interrogate the 
VLR regarding a MS currently in its area and to inform 
its VLR of a location update procedure initiated by a 
MS. It is also used when the MSC needs to inform the 
HLR, via the VLR, to update data modified by a 
subscriber regarding a specific supplementary service.
C
HLR and 
MSC
To interrogate the HLR to obtain routing information 
for a subscriber.
D
HLR and VLR
To exchange data related to a MS’s location and to the 
management of the subscriber. The VLR informs the 
HLR of the location of a MS managed by the latter 
and provides it with the MS’s roaming number. The 
HLR sends the VLR the data required to support the 
service to the subscriber. Also, when the HLR needs 
to instruct a previous VLR, it sends the data required 
to cancel the location registration of a subscriber. 
E
MSC and 
MSC
When a MS moves from one MSC area to another 
MSC area during a call, a handover procedure has to 
be initiated to maintain the connection. The MSCs 
exchange data to execute the procedure. After the 
procedure is completed, the MSCs exchange 
information to transfer A-interface signaling as 
necessary. It is also used to transfer a short message 
between the MSC serving the MS and the MSC that 
acts as the interface to the short message service 
center (SC).
F
MSC and 
EIR
It is used for data exchange so that the EIR can verify 
the status of IMEI retrieved for the MS.
G
VLR and VLR
It is used during registration procedure when a MS 
moves from one VLR area to another. 
H
HLR and 
AuC
It is used by the HLR to request data from AuC to 
authenticate and cipher data for a subscriber.
I
MSC and 
associated 
group call 
register 
It is used by the MSC to retrieve data related to a 
requested voice group call or broadcast call.

22  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
2.3	
User Authentication
When you switch on your MS, it sends a registration request to the BS. Upon 
receiving the request, the BS executes the authentication procedure to ensure that 
the request is from a valid user. Once you are authenticated, you may access the 
services offered by your service provider.
An authentication center (AuC) is associated with a HLR and stores an identity 
key for each subscriber registered with the associated HLR. The key is used to gen-
erate the data used to authenticate the international MS identity (IMSI) and a key

Frequency Reuse
An important concept in cellular networks is frequency reuse. Because there are a 
limited number of available channels, frequency reuse makes it possible to support 
more users with limited resources. Each cell is allocated a set of channels. Adjacent 
cells are assigned a completely different set of channels to avoid cochannel interfer-
ence. A footprint is the actual radio coverage of a cell and is determined from field 
measurements or propagation prediction models. Because the antenna of a BS is 
designed to cover only the cell it serves, the same set of channels can be assigned to 
two nonadjacent cells provided the distance between the two cells is large enough 
to keep interference levels within tolerable limits. The process of assigning the same 
set of channels to different cells is called frequency reuse (also termed frequency 
planning). In Figure 2.9, cells that are assigned the same set of channels are labeled 
with the same letter.
2.5	
Channel Assignment
There are two types of channel assignment strategies: fixed channel assignment and 
dynamic channel assignment. In the fixed channel assignment strategy, a predeter-
mined set of channels is allocated to a cell. A call request by a user is only served if

there is an unused channel. Otherwise, the call is blocked. A more flexible variation 
of this strategy allows a cell to borrow channels from a neighboring cell if all of its 
channels have been assigned to users. The borrowing process is supervised by the 
MSC.
In a dynamic channel assignment strategy, channels are not allocated per-
manently to a cell. Each time there is a call request, the BS requests a channel 
from the MSC. The MSC allocates a channel after considering factors such as 
the probability of future call blocking, the frequency of use of the candidate cell, 
and the reuse distance of the channel. The MSC allocates a frequency provided 
it is not currently in use in the same cell or in any neighboring cells that would 
result in cochannel interference. The advantages of a dynamic strategy are that it 
reduces the probability of call blocking due to its flexibility, and that all available 
channels are accessible to all cells. A drawback of a dynamic strategy is that it is 
more complex because the MSC has to collect real-time data on channel occu-
pancy, traffic distribution, and radio signal strength indication of all channels 
continuously. The amount of data collected and used in the channel allocation 
process increases storage and computational load on the system. The drawbacks 
are, however, compensated by increased channel utilization and reduced call 
blocking probability.
2.6	
Location Registration and Update
If you are using a landline telephone, the location information is embedded in the 
telephone number. For example, location information is embedded in the number 
03 7967 6300: 03 is the area code for Selangor and Kuala Lumpur; 7967 tells you 
that the subscriber is in the Petaling Jaya area—more specifically it is a number for 
the University of Malaya. Whenever anyone dials this number, the switches will set 
up a connection to the campus.
Conversely, because a mobile subscriber moves from one location to another, 
the mobile telephone number does not give location information. To deliver a call 
to a subscriber, the network operator needs to keep track of the location of all 
subscribers (ETSI TS 100 530 V7.0.0 1998). Location information is stored in a 
location register. There are two types of location registers:
	
1.	Home location register (HLR): A database that stores information for the 
management of mobile subscribers. A PLMN may consist of one or more 
HLRs, depending on the number of subscribers, the capacity of the equip-
ment, and the organization of the network. The information stored in HLRs 
are subscription information and location information to enable the charg-
ing and routing of calls to the MSC where you are located. Each subscrip-
tion is associated with an IMSI and one or more MS international ISDN 
(International Services Digital Network) numbers (MSISDN). The HLR 

Cellular Network Architecture  25
may also store other information such as service restriction and supplemen-
tary services.
	
2.	Visitor location register (VLR): A database that stores information required 
to handle call requests or deliveries made or received by subscribers roaming 
in its area. A VLR area is the part of the network controlled by a VLR and 
may consist of one or more MSC areas. A MSC area consists of all BSs under 
the control of the MSC and may consist of one or more location areas. The 
information stored in VLRs are the IMSI, the MSISDN, the MS roaming 
number, the temporary MS identity, the local MS identity and the location 
area where you are registered.
When is a location update triggered? It is triggered only when you move out of 
a location area and into another location area. A location area (LA) consists of one 
or more cells and is associated with a LA ID (LAI). When you roam into a new 
location area, your MS initiates a registration procedure. When the MSC in charge 
of the area notices the registration, it transfers the LAI of your location to the VLR. 
If your MS is not yet registered, the VLR and HLR exchange information to allow 
the proper handling of calls to you.
A service area is an area in which you can be reached by other mobile or fixed 
subscribers without them knowing your actual location. It may consist of several 
PLMNs.
When you power on your MS, it carries out an explicit IMSI attach operation to 
indicate to the PLMN that it has entered an active state. An explicit IMSI detach is 
carried out when you power down your MS (i.e., it enters an inactive state).
When a MS roams in a foreign network, the MSC passes information update 
messages between the MS and the VLR. An implicit detach timer is associated with 
the MS. This timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer. The VLR 
executes an implicit detach operation to mark a MS as detached when there has 
been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a period specified 
by the implicit detach timer. When a radio connection is established, the implicit 
detach timer is suspended and prevented from triggering an implicit detach. When 
the radio connection is released, the timer is reset and restarted.
2.7	
Handover Procedures
Handover (also handoff) procedures (ETSI 100 527 V7.0.0 1998) ensure that the 
connection to a MS is maintained when it moves from one cell to another. Let us 
say you are in a train and you are talking to your friend using your mobile phone. 
As the train moves, it crosses the cell boundary. When this happens, the BS in your 
current cell has to handover your connection to the BS in the cell that you are mov-
ing into to maintain the connection between you and your friend; otherwise, you 
will be disconnected. This process is handled by the handover procedure. A part of 

26  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
the procedure involves the allocation of a new channel for you in the new cell and 
the release of the channel allocated to you in your current cell. Figure 2.10 shows 
neighboring cells to which the call may be handed over.
How does the network decide when it is time to handover the connection? 
Handover is initiated based on radio subsystem criteria (e.g., radio frequency [RF] 
level, signal quality) and network directed criteria (e.g., current traffic load in the 
cell). Let us say the handover decision is made based on RF level. The MS takes 
radio measurements from neighboring cells and reports it to the serving cell peri-
odically. When the network determines that a handover is required, the handover 
procedure is initiated.
There are two types of handover:
	
1.	Intra-MSC handover: Handover between BSs under the control of the same 
MSC, including inter- and intra-BSS handovers.
	
2.	Inter-MSC handover: Handover between BSs under the control of different 
MSCs. This is further classified into three procedures:
	
a.	 Basic inter-MSC handover procedure: A MS is handed over from a con-
trolling MSC (MSC-A) to another MSC (MSC-B).
	
b.	 Subsequent inter-MSC procedure: A MS is handed over from a MSC-B 
to a third MSC (MSC-B´).
	
c.	 Subsequent inter-MSC handback: A MS is handed back from MSC-B to 
MSC-A.

2.7.1	 Intra-MSC Handover
The MSC-A controls the call, mobility management of the MS, and radio resources 
before, during, and after the handover. The BS system application part (BSSAP) 
procedures are initiated and handled by MSC-A. MSC-A initiates and controls the 
handover from its initiation until its completion. There are two types of handover:

2.	External handover: Takes place between channels on the same cells or 
between cells on the same BSS that is controlled by the MSC.
When the network detects that a handover is required, the following procedure is 
initiated. The messages passed during this procedure are shown in Figure 2.11. When 
BSS-A (the current BSS) determines that the MS should be handed over, it sends A-
Handover-Required to MSC-A. This message contains a list of cells to which the 
MS can be handed over, in order of preference, based on the criteria defined by the 
network operator. When MSC-A receives the message, it begins the process of hand-
ing over the MS to BSS-B (the new BSS). MSC-A generates A-Handover-Request 
to BSS-B. When BSS-B receives the message, it allocates its radio resource to the 
MS. Once the allocation is completed, it sends an acknowledgment, A-Handover-
Request-Ack, to MSC-A. When MSC-A receives the message, it initiates the process 
of instructing the MS to tune to the new channel by sending A-Handover-Command 
to BSS-A, which in turn, sends a RI-Handover-Command to the MS. This message 
contains a handover reference number allocated by BSS-B to the MS. The MS uses 
this reference number to access the new radio resource. This reference number is also 
included in a RI-Handover-Access sent by the MS to BSS-B so that BSS-B can check 
to ensure that it is as expected and the correct MS has been captured.
After BSS-B determines that it is correct, it sends A-Handover-Detect to MSC-
A. When the MS successfully communicates with BSS-B, it sends RI-Handover-
Complete to BSS-B, which in turn, sends A-Handover-Complete to MSC-A. Upon 
receiving the message, MSC-A sends A-Clear-Command to BSS-A so that BSS-A 
may begin the release of the resource allocated for the MS by BSS-A.

actions:
Retry the handover to the same cell.

The action to be taken depends on whether the failure occurs before or after 
A-Handover-Command has been sent. In any case, the existing connection to the 
MS is not cleared. During the process of switching to a new radio resource, there 
may be a short period when the MS is not in communication with the network. 
Any messages for the MS are queued at MSC-A and are delivered to it once com-
munication resumes.
2.7.2	 Basic Inter-MSC Handover
MSC-A controls the call and the mobility management before, during, and after a 
basic or subsequent handover. The BSSAP procedures are initiated and handled by 
MSC-A, if required. During a subsequent inter-MSC handback, MSC-A acts as a 
BSS to MSC-B. MSC-B controls the handover procedure until the termination of 
radio resource allocation in MSC-A. After radio channels have been allocated, all 
handover messages terminate in MSC-A. During a subsequent inter-MSC proce-
dure, MSC-A acts toward MSC-B´ as in the basic handover procedure and toward 
MSC-B as in the subsequent handback procedure.
There are two types of inter-MSC handover: one that requires a circuit con-
nection between MSC-A and MSC-B, and one that does not require a circuit 
connection.
2.7.2.1	Basic Handover Requiring a Circuit 
Connection between MSC-A and MSC-B
The handover is initiated by BSS-A sending the A-Handover-Required message (Fig-
ure 2.12). Upon receiving the message, MSC-A sends a MAP-Prepare-Handover 
request (MAP: mobile application part) to MSC-B. This message identifies the cell 
to which the MS is to be handed over and contains a complete A-Handover-Request. 
A-Handover-Request contains all the information required by MSC-B to allocate a 
new radio channel. MSC-B sends a MAP-Allocate-Handover-Number request to its 
associated VLR (i.e., VLR-B) to obtain a handover number that is used for routing the 
connection of the call from MSC-A to MSC-B. Upon receiving the handover num-

Cellular Network Architecture  31
ber in the MAP-Send-Handover-Report request message, MSC-B returns a MAP- 
Prepare-Handover response to MSC-A.
If a traffic channel is available at MSC-B, it sends a MAP-Prepare-Handover 
response to MSC-A. This message contains the complete A-Handover-Request-Ack 
that it receives from BSS-B. A-Handover-Request-Ack contains a radio resource 
definition that is later forwarded by BSS-A to the MS. Other traffic channel alloca-
tion results (A-Handover-Request-Ack or A-Handover-Failure) are sent to MSC-A 
using a MAP-Process-Access-Signaling request. If MSC-B is unable to allocate a 
channel, the MAP-Prepare-Handover response containing A-Handover-Failure is 
sent to MSC-A. The same is done if MSC-B detects a fault on the identity of the cell 
where the call is to be handed over. It is then up to MSC-A to decide on the action 
to take upon receiving negative responses or if the operation fails due to the expiry 
of the MAP-Prepare-Handover timer.
If MSC-A receives an error indication, it terminates the handover attempt. It may 
retry the handover using the cell identity list (if available) or it may reject the hand­
over attempt. In case of failure, the existing connection to the MS is not cleared.

Figure 2.12  Basic handover procedure requiring circuit connection. 

32  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Upon receiving A-Handover-Request-Ack, MSC-A establishes a circuit between 
itself and MSC-B by using the initial address message (IAM) and address complete 
message (ACM) of Signaling System No. 7 (SS7). If the circuit between MSC-A 
and MSC-B cannot be established, MSC-A aborts the handover by sending an 
appropriate error message, for example, ABORT. MSC-B waits for the capturing 
of the MS on the radio path when ACM is sent, and MSC-A initiates the handover 
execution when ACM is received.
When MSC-B receives an acknowledgment from the correct MS (A-Handover-
Detect or A-Handover-Complete), it forwards the acknowledgment to MSC-A. If 
MSC-B receives A-Handover-Detect from the correct MS, it forwards it to MSC-A 
using a MAP-Process-Access-Signaling request. If A-Handover-Complete is received, 
it is forwarded to MSC-A in a MAP-Send-End-Signal request. The circuit in MSC-A 
is through-connected when it receives A-Handover-Detect or A-Handover-Complete 
from MSC-B. The old radio channel is released upon the receipt of A-Handover-
Complete from MSC-B. When MSC-A receives a MAP-Send-End-Signal request 
that contains A-Handover-Complete, the resource allocated to the MS at BSS-A is 
cleared. MSC-A retains overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed sub-
scriber of the MS.
MSC-A aborts the handover if it detects clearing or interruption of the radio 
path before the call has been established on MSC-B. MSC-A may terminate the 
handover at any time by sending an appropriate MAP message to MSC-B.
2.7.2.2	Handover Not Requiring a Circuit 
Connection between MSC-A and MSC-B
The difference between this procedure and the one explained in the previous 
section is the establishment of circuits between network entities and the hand­
over number allocation (Figure 2.13). MSC-A sends a MAP-Prepare-Handover 
request to MSC-B, specifying that no handover number is required. MSC-B sends 
A-Handover-Request to BSS-B and allocates radio resources for the handover. 
It returns a MAP-Prepare-Handover response containing A-Handover-Request-
Acknowledge or A-Handover-Failure received from BSS-B to MSC-A. The hand­
over procedure proceeds as explained in section 2.7.2.1, except that there is no 
circuit connection establishment between MSC-A and MSC-B.
2.7.3	 Subsequent Handover Requiring Circuit 
Connection between MSC-A and MSC-B
If a subscriber moves into another MSC area during the same call, a subsequent 
handover is triggered to continue the connection (Figure 2.14). There are two pos-
sibilities: the MS moves back into the area of MSC-A or it moves into the area of 

Cellular Network Architecture  33
a third MSC (i.e. MSC-B´). The circuit between MSC-A and MSC-B is released 
after a successful handover.
2.7.3.1	Subsequent Handover from MSC-B to MSC-A
When MSC-B receives A-Handover-Required from BSS-A, it sends a MAP-
Prepare-Sub-Handover request containing the new MSC number (MSC-A) and 
the cell identity where the call is to be handed over to MSC-A. The complete 
A-Handover-Required is included in this message. Upon receiving the message, 
MSC-A initiates a search for a free radio channel. When it has assigned a radio 
channel, it returns a MAP-Prepare-Sub-Handover response containing a com-
plete A-Handover-Request-Ack to MSC-B.
2.7.3.2	Subsequent Handover from MSC-B to MSC-B’
This procedure is composed of two parts (Figure 2.15):

containing the complete A-Handover-Request-Ack received from BSS-B´, to inform 
MSC-B that MSC-B´ has successfully allocated radio resources on BSS-B´. When 
MSC-B receives this message, it initiates the procedure on the radio path.
The handover procedure at MSC-A is completed when MSC-A receives a MAP-
Send-End-Signal request from MSC-B´ containing A-Handover-Complete from 
BSS-B´, and the circuit between MSC-A and MSC-B is released. MSC-A sends 
MAP-Send-End-Signal response to MSC-B to terminate the dialogue between 
them. Subsequently, MSC-B releases the radio resources.
If any of the following occurs, MSC-A informs MSC-B of the failure by send-
ing A-Handover-Failure that is included in the MAP-Prepare-Subsequent-Handover 
response:
MSC-B´ cannot allocate a radio channel.

As in section 2.7.3, there are two possibilities: the MS moves back into the area of

Figure 2.16 shows the subsequent handover from MSC-B to MSC-A. The only 
difference between this procedure and the one shown in Figure 2.14 is that there is 
no circuit release between MSC-A and MSC-B´. Figure 2.17 shows the subsequent

CDMA
CDMA is a spread spectrum technology used in 2G and 3G communications 
systems. It is used in ultrahigh frequency cellular telephone systems in the 800-
MHz and 1.9-GHz bands. It is a multiplexing technique that allows several signals 
to share a transmission channel, thus, optimizing the use of available bandwidth. 
Transmissions from different stations occupy the entire frequency band at the 
same time. Different codes are used to produce the transmitted signals and to 
distinguish them. The code used by one station is orthogonal to the codes used by 
other stations.
An orthogonal code is similar to an object being orthogonal in a three-dimensional 
(3D) space, as illustrated in the following simplified examples. Two vectors are orthogo-
nal if their inner product is 0. Let us say we have two vectors: (1, 2, 3) and (2, 2, -2). 
The product of the two vectors is (1, 2, 3) × (2, 2, -2) = 2 + 4 + (-6) = 0. Two vectors are 
considered almost orthogonal if their product is close to 0: for example, (1, 2, 3) × (-3, 
2, 0) = -3 + 4 + 0 = 1. On the contrary, (2, 4, 6) is not orthogonal to (1, 3, 5) because 
their product is (2, 4, 6) × (1, 3, 5) = 2 + 12 + 30 = 44.
A spread spectrum technique spreads the bandwidth needed to transmit data. 
Assume that user data is generated at R bps. Each station is assigned a unique 
binary pseudorandom sequence, also known as the chip values. Each bit of user 
data is transformed into G bits by multiplying the user bit value by G chip val-
ues. The result is a sequence that appears to be random. The spreading factor G is 
selected so that the transmitted signal occupies the entire frequency band of the 
medium. A chip is one bit of a digital sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) code. A 
chip rate of a code is the number of bits per second (chips per second) at which the 
code is transmitted or received.
The sequence G chip values are (c1, c2, c3, . . ., cG), where ci takes a value of 
either +1 or -1. The -1 symbol represents bit 0, and +1 represents bit 1. When a 
station wants to transmit -1, it multiplies the -1 value by the sequence of G chip 
values. The resulting value is the signal transmitted to the receiver. When the 
signal arrives at the receiver, it is multiplied by G again and the resulting products 
are added. If the signal is received correctly, the resulting output correlator is either 
+G or -G.
Example
Station A and station B use spreading sequences that are orthogonal to 
each other. Assume that G = 4 and the spreading sequence of stations 
A and B are (+1, -1, -1, +1) and (+1, -1, +1, -1), respectively. Let us say 
station A wants to transmit -1 (bit 0). Station A multiplies the symbol 
it wants to transmit by its spreading sequence
-1 × (+1, -1, -1, +1) = (-1, +1, +1, -1).

38  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
The resulting symbol is transmitted to the receiver. When the receiver 
receives the signal, it calculates the product of the signal it receives with 
station A’s spreading sequence
(-1, +1, +1, -1) × (+1, -1, -1, +1) = (-1, -1, -1, -1) = -4 = -G.
The result of the calculation (i.e., -G) tells the receiver that it has 
decoded the signal correctly and that the received symbol is -1 (bit 0). 
If station A transmits +1, the result of the calculation should yield +4 = 
+G, which tells the receiver that the transmitted value is +1 (bit 1).
If station B receives the signal and tries the decode it using its 
spreading sequence, the result is
(-1, +1, +1, -1) × (+1, -1, +1, -1) = -1 -1 +1 +1 = 0.
Station B is unable to determine whether the received symbol is +1 or -1. 
Only a transmitter and receivers with knowledge of the correct spread-
ing sequence would be able to decode a received signal correctly.
CDMA is compatible with other cellular technologies, thus, allowing for 
nationwide roaming. The original CDMA standard is CDMA One and is still 
used in cellular telephone networks in the United States. The transmission speed is 
between 14.4 and 115 kbps.
There are a number of variations of the basic CDMA, such as WCDMA, time 
division CDMA, and CDMA2000. The ITU ratified two 3G standards, namely 
WCDMA and CDMA2000. WCDMA supports voice, images, data, and video. 
Utilizing the 5-MHz channel bandwidth, it is capable of carrying over 100 simul-
taneous voice calls and offers a data rate up to 8 Mbps.
CDMA2000 1xRTT (radio transmission technology standard, also referred to as 
IS-2000), CDMA2000 EV-DO (evolution–data optimized), and CDMA2000 EV-
DV (evolution–data and voice) are CDMA2000 approved radio interfaces for ITU’s 
IMT-2000 standard. CDMA operates in the 1.25 frequency band. CDMA2000 
EV-DO offers a data rate of 4.9 × N–Mbps downlink, and 1.8 × N–Mbps uplink, 
where N is the number of 1.25-MHz carriers dedicated to the system. CDMA2000 
EV-DV offers data rates of 3-Mbps downlink and 1.8-Mbps uplink.

The Move Toward 3G Networks
As 3G services are rolled out, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed. 
This section gives a glimpse of a few issues that may arise.

Cellular Network Architecture  39
Subscribers expect the same services available to them in their home network 
to be available when they are roaming, and at the same level of service quality. To 
illustrate how this might not always be possible, consider this scenario. Suppose 
that a subscriber from Kuala Lumpur roams in Paris and she requests a list of res-
taurants in a 5-km vicinity. Assuming that the visited network is able to provide 
her with the information, in what language should the information be presented? 
Would it be presented in Malay (her preferred language), English (as she is a visitor 
in a foreign network), or in French (which she might not understand)? Even though 
it is possible to require the subscriber to reconfigure her preferred settings when 
roaming, doing so means that a seamless service is not being provided. Moreover, 
it might not always be possible to translate information into the user’s preferred 
language.
In addition to the technical issues in supporting seamless roaming, there are 
also nontechnical issues; for example, from a legal perspective. The law regarding 
the encryption of data varies from country to country. What happens when a user 
crosses the border of a country that allows the use of strong encryption into one that 
imposes restrictions on its use? Copyright issues also arise regarding the distribution 
of information that might be restricted to certain geographical areas. For example, if 
an operator buys the right to broadcast a Formula One race in Asia Pacific, can they 
make it available to roaming customers in Europe? These issues must be kept in mind 
when designing new services.
Because a 3G network is implemented in stages, it is possible that a subscriber 
may roam from an area with 3G coverage to an area without 3G coverage. In this 
case, it should be possible to fall back onto the existing 2G network infrastructure, 
albeit at reduced functionality or quality of service (QoS). The subscriber should 
be moved back to the 3G network when coverage is available, but this should only 
be done when the coverage is stable to avoid oscillation between the two networks. 
This fallback approach gives rise to the issue of how billing should be handled. 
When a subscriber moves into a 2G network, should billing be adjusted to reflect 
the reduced level of service provided to the subscriber during this period? Doing 
so would increase the complexity of pricing and billing. How this is to be handled 
ought to be specified in the service level agreement between network operators.
The examples above hint at the complexity of the issues that have to be addressed. 
Although technical issues can be resolved given time and technological advances, 
nontechnical issues may require agreements between service providers in different 
countries or even between governments.

Chapter 3
Wireless Local 
Area Networks
A wireless local area network (WLAN) is attractive for several reasons. A WLAN is 
flexible and can be installed anywhere. For a small company, the expense of install-
ing a fixed network infrastructure might not be justified. Regulations on historical 
buildings might not permit the laying of cables that is required for installing a 
wired network infrastructure. In an enterprise, it extends access to the corporate 
local area network (LAN).
Another popular use of WLANs is to provide broadband Internet access at pub-
lic places such as cafés and airports. Areas covered by this service are known as hot 
spots. At conferences where there are high numbers of people convening for short 
periods, WLANs are used to provide participants with access to the Internet since: 
deploying a wired LAN for such short periods is not practical.
This chapter covers WLAN standards and protocols. Institute of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) has played an active role in defining standards for 
WLANs, known as the 802.11 family.
3.1	
IEEE 802.11 Standard
Work on the 802.11 standard commenced in 1989, and the final draft was released 
in 1997. 802.11 defines a basic service set (BSS) as comprising two or more fixed, 
portable, or moving nodes or stations that can communicate with each other in a 
limited geographical area. It defines two configurations: an infrastructure mode 
(Figure 3.1) with at least one central AP connected to the wired network, and an ad 

42  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
hoc (Figure 3.2) or peer-to-peer mode where a set of wireless stations communicate 
directly with one another without requiring a central AP or a wired connection. In 
an infrastructure configuration, the BSS is connected to the distribution system, 
which is usually the wired LAN. A handover is triggered when a station moves from 
the coverage area of one AP to another. In an ad hoc configuration, all stations are 
independent and equivalent. Stations may broadcast packets in the wireless cover-
age area without accessing the Internet. This configuration is very useful when a 
quick network setup is required without the hassle of dealing with cables, such as 
at a conference venue.
802.11 defines the physical layer and the medium access (MAC) layer. It defines 
three RF physical layers that operate at the 2.4-GHz industrial, scientific, and 
medical (ISM) band: frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), digital sequence 
spread spectrum (DSSS), and IR. FHSS and DSSS support a maximum bit rate of 2

Mbps in a clean environment and an optional 1 Mbps in a noisy environment. The 
IR physical layer offers 1 and 2 Mbps for receiving and 1 Mbps for transmitting. A 2 
Mbps transmission rate is offered as an option. It employs a technique called diffuse 
IR transmission that does not require directed transmission. The IR physical layer 
is not as popular as the FHSS and DSSS because the 10 m range imposes a serious 
constraint on the system.
In a WLAN, the carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/
CD) is unsuitable due to the hidden station problem. To demonstrate why CSMA/
CD is unsuitable, refer to Figure 3.3. Stations A and C are both within the trans-
mission range of station B, but are not within range of each other. Stations A and C 
are hidden from each other. Station C is currently transmitting to station B. At the 
same time, station A would like to transmit to station B. If A is using CSMA/CD, 
it first has to determine if anyone else is transmitting to B by sensing the channel. 
Because C is not within the range of A, it is unable to detect C’s transmission to B. 
It concludes that no one else is transmitting to B and starts its transmission, which 
collides with C’s transmission at B.
To overcome the hidden station problem, the standard specifies a distributed 
coordination function (DCF) known as carrier sense multiple access with collision 
avoidance (CSMA/CA) as an access protocol at the MAC layer. When a station has 
data to send, it executes the following six steps:
	
1.	It senses the channels.
	
2.	If an idle channel is detected, the station continues sensing the channel for an 
additional duration, termed the DCF interframe space (DIFS), to avoid a colli-
sion in case two stations sense an idle channel at the same time. If the channel is 
still idle after a period of DIFS, the station may start transmission.
	
3.	If the channel is busy, it defers transmission and enters a backoff state. The 
period following DIFS is called a contention window (CW) and consists of a 
predetermined number of slots.
	
4.	Upon entering a backoff state, the station randomly selects a slot in the CW and 
continuously senses the channel for a period up to the selected slot.
	
5.	If it does not detect any transmission, it captures the medium by starting to 
transmit its data.
	
6.	If during this period it detects a transmission from another station, it enters a 
backoff state again and the whole process is repeated.

Figure 3.4 demonstrates this operation. The receiving station sends an acknowledg-
ment (ACK) for each frame received successfully. High-priority frames (e.g., ACK, 
request to send [RTS], clear to send [CTS]) need only wait for a period of short 
interframe space (SIFS) before contending for the channel, where SIFS is less than 
DIFS.
To reduce the hidden station problem, a RTS-CTS mechanism is defined as an 
option. Before transmitting, a station sends a RTS frame and if the receiving sta-
tion is not expecting a frame from anyone else, it replies with a CTS frame. Upon 
receiving the CTS, the station that issued the RTS may begin transmission. The 
RTS-CTS frame contains information about how long it takes to transmit the data 
frame. When other stations within range of the receiving station hear the CTS, 
they refrain from transmitting and set a timer, called the network allocation vector 
(NAV). The NAV indicates the amount of time that must elapse before the current 
transmission is complete and the channel can be sampled for idle status. Figure 3.5 
illustrates this operation.
An optional mechanism defined by the standard is point coordination function 
(PCF) to support time-bounded service. It is used only in infrastructure configura-
tion. It provides a contention-free transmission through a point coordinator, which 
is a function performed by an AP. It is a master-slave approach, where the point 
coordinator is a polling master that coordinates all stations and determines which 
one can access the medium. Different QoS levels are supported through the use of 
a priority-polling mechanism. PCF has a higher priority than DCF and it may start 
transmission after a duration PCF interframe space (PIFS), where PIFS is less than 
DIFS and PIFS is greater than SIFS. A contention-free period (CFP) alternates with 
a contention period (CP) over time. A CFP and CP form a superframe. PCF is used 
to access the medium during CFP, and DCF is used during CP.
The point coordinator transmits a beacon frame to mark the beginning of a 
superframe. The beacon is transmitted at regular intervals, so each station knows 
when the next beacon frame will arrive, which is the target beacon transition time 
(TBTT) and is announced in every beacon. All stations set their NAV before the 
CFP. The point coordinator polls a station with data to transmit. If the station has 
pending data, it replies with an acknowledgment that can also be piggybacked with 
other data frames. If the point coordinator does not receive a reply after a period of 
PIFS, it polls the next station. If the point coordinator has pending data for the sta-

tion, it combines the data and poll frames in a CF-poll frame. The polling contin-
ues until the CFP expires. The point coordinator terminates CFP by broadcasting 
a CF-end frame. Figure 3.6 illustrates the PCF operation.
3.2	
IEEE 802.11b Standard (Wi-Fi)
In 1999, the 802.11 standard was revised and a new standard, 802.11b was released. 
This standard is more popularly known as Wi-Fi. It ensures compatibility with 
legacy 802.11 products by using the DSSS physical layer and operating at the same 
2.4-GHz frequency band. It offers a maximum bit rate of 11 Mbps (comparable to 
a fixed Ethernet) with fallback rates of 5, 2, and 1 Mbps. This approach provides 
for smooth transition to faster WLAN systems. The access protocol used is similar 
to 802.11.
A Wi-Fi device typically consumes about 100 to 350 mA of power. The power 
management strategy specifies that a Wi-Fi device may be in either an awake or a 
doze state. In the doze state, the station cannot transmit nor receive. There are two 
power management modes: active mode (AM) and power save mode (PS). A station 
that wishes to go into PS must inform the AP by setting the power management

bit in the packet header. In an infrastructured network, the AP stores all traffic 
addressed to stations that are in PS. When the AP transmits the periodic beacon, it 
lists the stations in PS and whether traffic is pending for them. Stations in PS switch 
to AM at regular intervals to receive the beacon. If there is pending traffic for them, 
the stations receive the traffic and then return to PS. In an ad hoc network, traffic 
destined for stations in PS is stored in a distributed fashion among active stations 
because there is no AP. All stations in PS switch to awake state in a temporal win-
dow, called an announcement traffic indication message (ATIM) window, during 
which stations that store pending traffic for other nodes send special frames called 
ATIM frames. If a station receives an ATIM frame, it remains awake to receive the 
traffic, otherwise it returns to PS until the next ATIM window.
Even though Wi-Fi quickly became popular due to its high bit rate, interference 
in the 2.4-GHz ISM band is a serious problem. To overcome this problem, IEEE 
released the 802.11a standard that operates in the 5-GHz frequency band.
3.3	
IEEE 802.11a Standard
Because 802.11a operates at a different frequency band than 802.11 and 802.11b, it 
is incompatible with the previous two standards. Moreover, 802.11a uses orthogonal 
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to offer a higher bit rate of up to 54 Mbps. 
OFDM makes more efficient use of the spectrum, and the high data rate is achieved 
by using up to 52 carriers to transmit data from a single source. Other speeds offered 
are 6, 12, and 24 Mbps. The major drawback in using the 5-GHz band is it is not 
license-free in all countries. To address this problem, IEEE enhanced the 802.11a 
standard by releasing the 802.11g standard.
The 802.11a standard defines a variable length packet. The MAC layer provides 
two types of service: asynchronous and contention-free. Like 802.11, the asyn-
chronous service implements CSMA/CA with a binary exponential backoff known 
as DCF. It defines a basic access method and an optional four-way handshaking 
known as the RTS-CTS method.
Figure 3.7 shows the format of the physical protocol data unit (PPDU). The 
header contains the payload length, the transmission rate, a parity bit, and a tail. 
The rate field specifies the type of modulation and the coding rate used in the rest

of the packet. The length field specifies the number of bytes in the physical service 
data unit (PSDU) and takes a value between 1 and 4095. The parity bit is a positive 
parity for the first 17 bits of the header. The tail bits are used to reset the convolu-
tional encoder and terminate the code trellis in the decoder. The first seven bits in 
the service field are set to zero and are used to initialize the descrambler, and the 
remaining bits are reserved for future use. The pad bits ensure that the number of 
bits in the PPDU maps to a number of OFDM symbols.
3.4	
IEEE 802.11g Standard
The 802.11g standard offers a maximum bit rate of 54 Mbps and operates in the 2.4-
GHz ISM band like 802.11, but uses OFDM instead of DSSS. It is compatible with 
802.11b and provides a smooth transition from 802.11b for organizations that need to 
migrate to a WLAN offering a higher bit rate. In addition to OFDM, 802.11g supports 
the packet binary convolution code that offers bit rates of 22 and 33 Mbps as options. 
Its operating range is 100 m under ideal indoor conditions and 100 m outdoors.
3.5	
HIPERLAN/2
HIPERLAN/2 is a European standard that operates in the 5-GHz band offering a 
maximum bit rate of 54 Mbps and makes use of OFDM. The spectrum allocation 
is 455 MHz in Europe, 300 MHz in the United States, and 100 MHz in Japan. The 
system can be deployed indoors and outdoors. In a normal operation, a MS com-
municates with other stations via the AP. For direct links (DiLs), stations in the 
same radio cell may exchange data directly. In both cases, the AP controls access 
to the medium and the assignment of radio resources to the stations. It provides 
support for multimedia applications.
3.5.1	 The Convergence Layer
Figure 3.8 shows the HIPERLAN/2 protocol stack. The convergence layer per-
forms two functions:
	
1.	Adapts service requests from higher layers to the service offered by the data 
link control.
	
2.	Converts the variable-size higher layer packet to a fixed-size service data unit 
(SDU) that is used within the data link control (DLC) layer.
This layer provides interworking functions to support different core networks, 
including the mapping of QoS parameters and traffic requirements, segmentation 
and reassembly (SAR), and header translation.

48  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
3.5.2	 The DLC Layer
The DLC layer is divided into two parts, namely the DLC control part and the 
DLC user part. It handles:
Association control: Association establishment, authentication, encryption 
N
N
key exchange, disassociation
DLC control: Connection setup, release, and modify, multicast
N
N
Radio resource control (RRC): Link adaptation, power control, dynamic fre-
N
N
quency selection (DFS), handover
After an association, the station can request a dedicated control channel that is 
used to set up the radio bearers. A station may request multiple DLC connections, 
each with a unique QoS support that is determined by the AP.
The DFS operation enables an AP to select a frequency automatically based 
on interference measurements, accessible range of carriers, and a target carrier-
to-interference ratio. The control part handles the exchange of data between an 
AP and a MS. The radio link quality may change with time, depending on the 
radio environment; for example, the traffic in surrounding cells. A link adaptation 
scheme is used to cope with the variation in both uplink and downlink channels. 
The physical layer mode is adapted based on the current link quality. The AP 
measures the link quality on the uplink channel and indicates in the frame control 
channel (FCH) which physical layer mode the station should use. Likewise, the 
MS measures the link quality on the downlink channel and suggests a physical 
mode to use in its resource request (RR) message, but the AP is responsible for the 
final selection of the physical mode to be used for both downlink and uplink.
The error control function detects and recovers transmission errors. The user 
part handles error control with three modes of operation:
MAC Layer
Data Link Layer
User Part

1.	Acknowledged mode provides retransmission that is based on selective repeat 
automatic repeat requests (ARQs) to ensure reliability.
	
2.	Repetition mode offers some reliability and is based on repeating the data-
bearing DLC protocol data units (PDUs). The transmitter can arbitrarily 
retransmit PDUs to achieve a more reliable reception. The receiver only 
accepts PDUs with sequence numbers (SNs) within the receiver’s acceptance 
window.
	
3.	Unacknowledged mode provides unreliable, low latency transmission. The 
receiver delivers all correctly received PDUs to the convergence layer. There is 
no feedback channel.
DLC is also responsible for traffic management. The mechanisms defined are:
Wireless connection admission control: Responsible for accepting a new 
N
N
DLC connection based on QoS parameters, traffic requirements, and radio 
link quality.
Wireless congestion control (WCC): Responsible for detecting congestion in 
N
N
the AP area cell. The MS and AP WCC take appropriate action when conges-
tion is detected.
Scheduler: Responsible for allocating capacity to peer DLC control traffic 
N
N
and DLC connections’ traffic links. Capacity allocation is performed using 
TDMA time division duplex (TDMA/TDD). It also preserves the traffic 
characteristics on established DLC connections.
3.5.3	 The MAC Layer
The medium access control (MAC) layer is designed to provide the QoS to support 
multimedia and real-time applications. Its medium access uses the TDMA/TDD 
approach with a MAC frame with a period of 2 ms. The standard defines a fixed 
length packet. The MAC scheme is based on a central controller located at the AP. 
The central controller determines the direction of information flow between the AP 
and the station at a given time. The flow utilizes a time slotted structure called a 
MAC frame (Figure 3.9), consisting of three time slots and three phases. The time 
slots are:
	
1.	Broadcast control channel: Contains control information sent in every MAC 
frame to enable RRC functions.
	
2.	Frame control channel (FCH): Contains an exact description of resource 
allocation within the current MAC frame.
	
3.	Access feedback control channel (ACH): Conveys information on previous 
random access attempts.
The three phases are uplink to the AP, downlink from the AP, and DiL between 
two stations. The phases are allocated dynamically depending on the demand for 

50  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
transmission resources. The allocation is handled centrally by the AP. Before trans-
mitting, a station has to request capacity from the AP using the RACH.
A station with data to transmit requests capacity by sending a RR containing 
the number of pending long transport channel (LCH) PDUs that the station cur-
rently has for the particular DLC connection to the AP. The station may use the 
contention slots, which are based on slotted ALOHA, to send the RR message. If a 
collision occurs, the station is informed in the ACH of the next MAC frame, result-
ing in the station executing a backoff procedure. After sending the RR, the station 
goes into a contention-free mode where the AP schedules the downlink and uplink 
channels for the station. The scheduling is handled centrally by the AP, enabling 
efficient QoS support. From time to time, the AP may poll the station for more 
information about pending PDUs currently at the station.
There are two types of PDUs for the three phases:
	
1.	A long PDU is 54 bytes long and contains control or user data with 48 bytes 
allocated for the payload. The remaining bytes are used for PDU type, a SN, 
and cyclic redundancy check (CRC). A long PDU is referred to as a LCH.
	
2.	A short PDU is nine bytes long and contains only control data. It may contain 
RRs, ARQ messages, or other control information. A short PDU is referred 
to as a short transport channel (SCH).
Traffic to or from a station can be multiplexed onto one PDU train containing long 
and short PDUs (Figure 3.10). Each connection contains 54 octets LCH for data 
and 9 octets SCH for control messages.
Each user is assigned zero, one, or more slots in a frame. The number of slots 
assigned to a user varies from frame to frame depending on the amount of band-
width requested by the station. The uplink and downlink packets are sent on the 
same frequency channel using TDD.

3.5.4	 The Physical Layer
The physical (PHY) layer uses OFDM with a carrier spacing of 20 MHz. Table 3.1 
lists the seven modes defined in this layer. The first six modes are mandatory; mode 
7 is optional. The AP uses the link adaptation operation to select the highest possi-
ble physical layer mode for uplink and downlink channels based on radio link qual-
ity measurements. There are 52 subcarriers per channel: 48 subcarriers carry data 
and 4 subcarriers are pilots that facilitate coherent modulation. This layer maps the 
physical layer SDU received from DLC into a framing format, namely PHY-PDU, 
for transmission.
Functions performed by the physical layer are:
Radio channel quality measurement and interrogation to determine the chan-

the PHY layers of the various 5-GHz WLAN standards are harmonized, which 
helps in facilitating low-cost production of devices conforming to all standards.

IEEE 802.1x Standard
802.1x is a port-based network access control standard that provides mutual authen-
tication of a network and a client. It addresses the problem of rogue APs that can 
be easily installed in a corporate environment. The users authenticate themselves 
to the actual LAN, not the AP, through an authentication database such as remote 
authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS) server.
This standard utilizes an existing protocol—Extensible Authentication Proto-
col (EAP). Three components involved in the authentication are the supplicant 
(usually the client agent), the authenticator (usually the AP), and the authentication 
server (RADIUS). The user authentication data is transported using EAP and are 
encapsulated in 802.1x messages.
3.7	
IEEE 802.11i Standard
Due to the ease of cracking the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol encryp-
tion, IEEE defines two stronger encryption algorithms in the 802.11i standard, 
namely WEP2 (an enhanced version of WEP) and advanced encryption standard 
(AES). It uses the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) as a patch for legacy 
802.11 to correct vulnerabilities in the WEP protocol, particularly the reuse of 
encryption keys. It adds a 64-bit message integrity check, an extended initialization 
vector with packet sequencing, a rekeying mechanism, and per-packet key mixing 
in addition to a 128-bit data encryption. AES lets administrators specify a 128-, 
192- or 256-bit key. When AES is ratified as part of the revised WEP standard, it 
eliminates the use of the 24-bit initialization vector (IV), which is the main weak-
ness in the current version of WEP. Although AES may address the current security

concerns, its deployment will not be problem-free. Vendors have to replace existing 
APs and other equipment to comply with the new standard. The use of a longer key 
means that client devices will need extra processing power to perform encryption 
and decryption, possibly causing a performance slow down. The additional process-
ing requirement results in more power consumption on WLAN cards.
TKIP, a temporary solution until 802.11i is ratified, uses a 128-bit temporary 
key, but all users on a specific AP share the same key, which means that if one user is 
compromised, everybody is vulnerable to an attack. The difference between TKIP 
and WEP is that TKIP changes the key every 10,000 packets, whereas WEP keys 
are static.
3.8	
IEEE 802.11e Standard
There are a few drawbacks of the 802.11 PCF that make it difficult to provide QoS 
guarantee:
When a point coordinator schedules the beacon transmission at TBTT, the 
N
N
beacon can only be transmitted when the medium has been idle for at least 
PIFS, resulting in a possible delay in transmitting the beacon frame.
The delay in transmitting the beacon results in delays in the transmission of 
N
N
time-bounded packets that have to be delivered during CFP. There is a possi-
bility that delivery may not be finished before the next TBTT. The unpredict-
able delays in each CFP may severely affect QoS guarantees.
Unknown transmission duration of a polled station because the station is 
N
N
allowed to send a frame of arbitrary length (maximum of 2304 bytes), thus, 
affecting the QoS guarantee to other stations.
802.11e is a supplemental standard to provide QoS guarantees in a WLAN. It 
defines enhancements to the 802.11 MAC with the introduction of enhanced dis-
tributed coordination function (EDCF) and hybrid coordination function (HCF). 
A station that is 802.11e-compliant is termed an enhanced station. An enhanced 
station that acts as a centralized controller for all other stations within the same 
QBSS (a BSS that contains 802.11e-compliant HC and stations) is termed a hybrid 
coordinator (HC). A HC is a function in a 802.11e-compliant AP. There are still 
two alternating phases in a superframe: CP and CFP. EDCF is used during CP 
only when HCF is used in both phases.
 3.8.1	 EDCF
Traffic is classified into traffic categories (TCs). A station may generate more than 
one type of traffic and each type of traffic is handled independently of the others. 

54  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Frames are delivered according to multiple backoff instances at a station, where each 
backoff instance is based on a specific TC parameter. During CP, a station contends 
for a transmission opportunity (TXOP) and independently starts a backoff after 
detecting an idle channel for a period of arbitration interframe space (AIFS), where 
AIFS is greater than PIFS and AIFS is greater than or equal to DIFS. The value 
of AIFS may be increased for each TC. After AIFS expires, each backoff sets a 
counter to a random value from the interval [I, CW+1]. The minimum size is (CW 
min[TC]), where CW is a TC-dependent parameter. If the channel is detected to be 
busy before the counter reaches zero, the backoff has to wait for the channel to be 
idle before restarting AIFS. The backoff counter is reduced by one at the beginning 
of the last slot interval of AIFS when the channel is idle during AIFS; whereas in 
legacy DCF, the counter is reduced at the beginning of the first slot after DIFS.
An unsuccessful transmission causes the value for CW to be increased based 
on the persistence factor PF[TC], that is, newCW[TC] ≥ {(oldCW[TC] + 1) × PF} 
-1, and another backoff counter is calculated based on the new CW to reduce the 
probability of another collision. This is unlike legacy 802.11 where the value of CW 
is doubled after an unsuccessful transmission.
Each station may have up to eight transmission queues, each with its own QoS 
parameters that determine its priority (Figure 3.11). If more than one counter 
reaches zero at the same time, a scheduler in the station avoids a virtual collision by 
granting TXOP to the TC with the highest priority. TXOP is the duration a station 
has the right to transmit, starting at start time up to a maximum duration. There 
are two types of TXOP:

1.	EDCF-TXOP: Granted by contention and the duration is constrained by a 
QBSS-wide limit distributed in the beacon frame.
	
2.	Polled-TXOP: The duration is specified by the duration field inside the poll 
frame.
The prioritized channel access is governed by the QoS parameters per TC, 
namely AIFS[TC], Cw min[TC], OF[TC], and CW max[TC] (optional). The 
parameters may be adapted over time and are announced periodically in the bea-
con frames.
3.8.2	 HCF
HC may only grant a TXOP to itself or another station after the channel has been 
idle for PIFS. During CP, a TXOP begins when either (AIFS plus backoff time) has 
expired or the station receives a poll frame, QoS CF-Poll, from the HC. HC may 
send a QoS CF-Poll after PIFS without any backoff and may issue polled TXOPs 
during CP using its prioritized medium access.
During CFP, stations do not contend for the channel. Only the HC can grant 
TXOPs using the QoS CF-Poll frame. The start time and maximum duration of 
a TXOP is specified using the QoS CF-Poll frame. The CFP ends after the time 
announced in the beacon frame or when HC transmits a CF-end frame.
The 802.11e standard defines a random access protocol for fast collision resolu-
tion. This mechanism allows stations to request for polled TXOPs by sending RRs 
without contending with other DCF/EDCF traffic. A controlled contention occurs 
during a controlled contention interval that starts when the HC sends a specific 
control frame. The control frame forces legacy stations to set their NAV and remain 
silent during the interval. The control frame defines controlled contention oppor-
tunities (i.e., short intervals separated by SIFS) and a filtering mask containing the 
TCs in which RRs may be placed. A station that has pending traffic with a TC that 
matches the filtering mask chooses an opportunity interval and transmits a RR 
frame containing the requested TC and TXOP duration or the queue size of the 
requested TC. For fast collision resolution, the HC acknowledges the reception of 
a request by generating a control frame with a feedback field so that the requesting 
station can detect collisions during controlled contention.
3.9	
Security Issues
The 802.11 standard defines the WEP to encrypt messages using a Rivest Cipher 4 
(RC4) pseudorandom number generator with two key structures: 40 and 128 bits. 
RC4 is a symmetric algorithm where a secret key is deployed at the AP and the sta-
tion. The secret key is used for encrypting data and checking data integrity. It is also 
used by an AP to authenticate stations. The goals of WEP are:

56  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Confidentiality to prevent eavesdropping.
N
N
Access control to protect access to the wireless network infrastructure. There 
N
N
is an option to discard all packets not encrypted using WEP.
Data integrity to prevent tampering with the transmitted message, which is 
N
N
achieved using an integrity checksum.
Even though the standard allows the key to be up to 104 bits long, the imple-
mentation usually uses a 40-bit key, which is too short. WEP concatenates the 40-
bit secret key with a 24-bit IV to produce a 64-bit RC4 key stream. Because the IV 
is sent to the receiver in plain text so that the receiver can generate the same key 
stream, an attacker can see the first 24 bits of each key sent using WEP. The stan-
dard allows the IV to be reused, so an attacker can easily collect the IV and use it to 
deduce the secret key shared by the AP and the station.
Another drawback of WEP is its poor key management, where the keys in a 
device may be left unchanged for long periods. If the device is lost or stolen, an 
attacker can use the key to compromise the device and any other devices that share 
the key. Dynamic key management solutions could help address this problem.
WEP’s implementation of the CRC-32 algorithm calculates a 32-bit checksum 
to verify the integrity of packets sent over the air. Because the checksum is not 
encrypted, a side-channel attack may compromise data integrity.
An AP has to be configured properly before deployment in a WLAN. Most 
manufacturers ship APs with WEP disabled with default parameter values that 
must be changed. Among the parameters that have to be configured are the AP’s 
password, simple network management protocol parameters, channel selection, 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) setup, and the integrated firewall 
configuration. If it is not configured properly, an attacker can easily compromise 
the network by utilizing the default values. For example, because products from 
the same vendor have the same default service set identifier (SSID) that is required 
to access the network, it is imperative that the SSID is changed. At the same time, 
it is also critical to turn off the AP’s broadcast mode that broadcasts the unit’s 
SSID. Otherwise, anyone with a wireless network interface card (NIC) could get 
the SSID from the AP itself, which renders changing the SSID pointless.
A device’s MAC address is its unique ID and can be used to authenticate a device. 
Unfortunately, because the MAC address is broadcast in plain text, an attacker 
can easily eavesdrop on a transmission to obtain the MAC addresses of authorized 
devices, and later, use the address to gain unauthorized access to the network. If 
a NIC with the MAC address defined as “allowed” is stolen, the attacker can use 
the card to gain access to the WLAN. If the theft is reported, the network admin-
istrator has to update the MAC address filter on all APs to prevent unauthorized 
access, which might be time-consuming on a large network. An enterprise wireless 
gateway (EWG) reduces the hassle of updating this information by providing a 
centralized point of security.

Wireless Local Area Networks  57
Instead of using brute force to decrypt a message, an attacker can use Inter-
net Protocol (IP) redirection to trick an AP into decrypting a message for it. An 
attacker sniffs an encrypted packet transmitted over the air and modifies it so that 
it is sent to a new destination address that the attacker controls. When the modified 
packet arrives at the AP, it decrypts the packet and sends the decrypted packet to 
the new destination where the attacker can read it.
Another technique to trick an AP is a reaction attack that exploits a Transmis-
sion Control Protocol (TCP) characteristic that requires an acknowledgment to be 
sent for each packet that is received error-free. An attacker can identify an acknowl-
edgment packet by its size—the attacker does not need to decrypt a packet to ascer-
tain if it is an acknowledgment. An attack is launched by intercepting a ciphertext, 
flipping a few bits in the ciphertext, and adjusting the CRC accordingly to obtain 
a new ciphertext with a valid WEP checksum. The modified ciphertext is transmit-
ted to the AP. The attacker then waits to see if the eventual recipient sends a TCP 
ACK, which tells the attacker whether the modified text passes the TCP checksum 
and was accepted. By carefully choosing the bits to flip, the attacker ensures that 
the TCP checksum remains undisturbed. Thus, the presence or absence of an ACK 
packet reveals one bit of information about the unknown plaintext. The attacker 
can then deduce the remaining unknown bits using classical techniques.
To gain access to the WLAN, an attacker has to gain access via an AP. There-
fore, it is important that an AP should be placed at a secure point to avoid easy 
access to it, thus, compromising security. A particular threat is what is termed as 
a rogue AP, which is an AP installed by an unauthorized employee or an attacker. 
Employees (with or without malicious intent) may install a rogue AP from their 
cubicles to connect to the corporate network without the knowledge of the network 
administrator. If the AP is not properly configured, it may become a security hole in 
the network. Even though a standard specifies the range that signals can travel (i.e., 
the coverage area), it is not unusual for signals to travel beyond the specified cover-
age area (Figure 3.12). An attacker does not have to be in the building to install a 
rogue AP. An attacker may sit outside the building and gain access to the corporate 
network through an AP whose signal has traveled beyond the corporate network 
boundary. This type of attack is known as “war driving.” Signals may travel beyond 
the corporate office boundary and leak into parking lots, another company’s office, 
and public places. This problem can be solved by walking around the company’s 
perimeter with a spectrum analyzer to check whether signals travel beyond the 
desired area. This also helps in detecting rogue APs. If the signal is found to travel 
beyond the desired coverage area, the network administrator can take corrective 
actions by lowering the AP’s signal strength, moving it to a location where its signal 
does not go beyond the desired area, or using different types of antennas to control 
signal strength and direction. Smart antennas that can control an AP’s signal to 
confine it to a specific area can also help mitigate this problem.
Hot spots not only can be used to gain access to the Internet, but also to pri-
vate and corporate networks. You may use the hot spot at the airport to access the  

58  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
corporate server while waiting for your flight. By doing so, you open a channel to 
your corporate network. Because public networks, such as hot spots, provide mini-
mal security, if any, attackers can sniff the network and view all packets transferred 
in plaintext. This problem can be avoided by configuring the system to disallow 
access from public networks but doing so would limit the user’s mobility and ser-
vice availability. Another option is to use a virtual private network to secure con-
nection through public WLANs by creating a tunnel or using a secure encrypted 
connection between the mobile user and the destination. Installing a personal fire-
wall on the user’s device also provides added protection.
Steps that can be taken to prevent unauthorized access include:
Use EWG to authenticate users and filter unauthorized users.

3.10	 IP over 802.11 WLAN
A few APs can be interconnected through an IP routed network to form the 
WLAN IP network. Referring to Figure 3.13, an access router (AR) connects one 
or more APs to the network. The APs exchange IP packets with the ARs. They 
also act as ARP proxies for the MSs associated to them. At any one time, a MS is 
connected with one AR, termed a serving AR. When a MS moves across APs con-
nected through the same AR, an intra-AR handover takes place, and an inter-AR 
handover takes place when the APs are connected to different ARs. An intra-AP 
handover is handled using Inter-AP Protocol. For inter-AP handover, the new AR 
interacts with the MS to perform an IP handover.

3.11	 Integrating 802.11 WLAN and UMTS
There are two possible scenarios for the deployment of WLANs in public areas (Jas-
eemuddin 2003). It may be a hot spot that is deployed as a standalone network that 
is not connected to a UMTS network. You may subscribe to UMTS and WLAN 
services through the same service provider; in which case, it is cost-effective for 
the operator to use a common authentication and billing infrastructure. The other 
possibility is a roaming scenario where the WLAN operates in conjunction with 
a UMTS network, where the WLAN is used to support high-speed data transfer. 
UMTS on its own is able to sustain a per user data rate of a few hundred kilobits 
per second and is limited by the total cell capacity of up to 2–3 Mbps. Given that 
a WLAN is able to support a data rate of up to 54 Mbps, it is used to augment the 
packet data service of UMTS. Users may use a dual-mode station to access the two 
networks, where one interface connects to the WLAN, and the other connects to 
UMTS. The networks are configured such that WLANs form microcells within 
UMTS macrocells.
The following issues have to be addressed before integrating UMTS and 802.11 
WLANs:
Assess the impact in QoS differences of the two networks on the types of 
N
N
applications that users can run and, hence, the type of traffic handled by each 
network. UMTS support four levels of QoS—interactive, voice, stream, and 
best-effort—whereas currently, 802.11 only supports best-effort traffic until 
the implementation of PCF provides support for isochronous traffic.

60  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Be aware that GPRS and WLAN support different connection paradigms, 
N
N
that is, connection-oriented and connectionless, respectively.
Decide on the handling of packet routing across two networks with differ-
N
N
ent mobility management schemes. GPRS packets are routed through tunnels 
established between GPRS gateway support node–serving gateway support node 
GGSN-SGSN­ and SGSN–radio network controller (RNC), whereas packet rout-
ing in IP networks may be achieved by using tunnels (e.g., Hierarchical Mobile IP 
version 6 [HMIPv6]) or host-specific routing (e.g., cellular IP).
Decide whether to connect a WLAN to RNC, SGSN, or GGSN. The best 
N
N
integration point has to be selected taking into consideration different cost-
performance benefits for different scenarios.
The integration architecture in Figure 3.14 uses SGSN as the integration point, 
not RNC or GGSN. The RNC performs radio-specific tasks (e.g., converts pack-
ets into radio frames, manages radio resources). Because the radio interfaces of 
WLAN and RNC are totally different, making RNC an integration point would 
require major revision of complex radio procedures. Hence, it is not an option. 
Using GGSN as an integration point is also unsuitable because during handover 
to UMTS, SGSN has to re-create the mobility state and acquire or reestablish 
the Packet Data Protocol (PDP) session and radio access bearer (RAB) context. 
Because this information is not held at GGSN, making it the integration point 
would slow down the handover process.
This architecture is designed for use in hot spots and is designed to fulfill the 
following requirements:
Users in a WLAN use 802.11 to establish a data connection and the UMTS 
N
N
radio network subsystem (RNS) to establish a voice connection. The connec-
tions can be established in parallel.
WLAN is used to augment the data service, thus, allowing users to run appli-
N
N
cations that they cannot run if they are connected only to UMTS.
Users in UMTS network use UMTS RNS for both data and voice services.
N
N
When a MS moves to a WLAN microcell, the packet data connection through 
UMTS RNS is dismantled and reestablished through the WLAN, but a voice con-
nection is still maintained through UMTS RNS. For this to be possible, the user 
must use a dual-mode station with two interfaces that allows parallel access to the 
WLAN and UMTS. In this architecture, the SGSN is the integration point and it 
sees the WLAN and UMTS as two different networks.
Referring to Figure 3.14, the WLAN is connected to SGSN through bor-
der routers. A connection through a UMTS network requires explicit signaling 
between the MS and the network to establish and manage the bearer path. The MS 
in a WLAN cell maintains connectivity to both networks through different inter-

Wireless Local Area Networks  61
faces. Both bearer and signaling paths for PS connections are established through 
WLAN to the SGSN.
If a node is switched on in a UMTS cell, it only receives beacons from a UMTS 
BS, thus, it activates the UMTS interface and executes the UMTS power-up pro-
cedure. If it is switched on in a WLAN, it can be connected to both UMTS and 
WLAN. It receives beacons from both the UMTS BS and 802.11 AP. First, it runs 
the UMTS-GPRS power-up procedure through the UMTS interface during which 
it ignores the beacons received from the 802.11 interface. On power-up, it attaches 
to GPRS and establishes the basic data service (a best-effort bearer service) connec-
tion through serving RNS (SRNS) with the SGSN and GGSN. The PDP context

is established at the GGSN, SGSN, and the MS, whereas the mobility context is 
established at the SGSN and MS. The SRNS performs RAB setup for the best-
effort bearer service. After performing the UMTS power-up procedure, it responds 
to the 802.11 beacons by running the association procedure with the AP. Once it 
is associated with the AP, it runs the UMTS-WLAN handover procedure to hand­
over the basic data connection to WLAN (Figure 3.15).
The GGSN assigns an IP address for the MS, which it uses to communicate 
with other nodes in the Internet. This IP address is not guaranteed to be topologi-
cally correct for the WLAN the MS is associated to. Therefore, it may request for a 
temporary topologically correct address from the WLAN, called a care of address 
(COA). The COA is used as the tunnel endpoint for packets tunneled between the 
SGSN and the MS.

3.12	 Summary
The WLAN standards are specified in IEEE 802.11. There are two types of con-
figuration: infrastructure mode with at least one central AP connected to the wired 
network and an ad hoc or peer-to-peer mode. It defines three RF physical layers 
that operate at the 2.4-GHz ISM band: FHSS, DSSS, and IR. Instead of CSMA/
CD, 802.11 specifies DCF, also known as CSMA/CA to overcome the hidden sta-
tion problem.
The 802.11b standard, more popularly known as Wi-Fi, offers a maximum bit 
rate of 11 Mbps (comparable to a fixed Ethernet) with fallback rates of 5, 2, and 
1 Mbps. The access protocol used is similar to 802.11. Even though Wi-Fi is very 
popular, interference in the 2.4-GHz ISM band is a serious problem. To overcome 
it this problem, IEEE released the 802.11a standard that operates in the 5-GHz 
frequency band.
Another WLAN standard is HIPERLAN/2, a European standard that oper-
ates in the 5-GHz band offering a maximum bit rate of 54 Mbps and makes use of 
OFDM. It provides support for multimedia operations.
Current trends show that WLAN will coexist with traditional wired LANs 
to provide wider coverage to users and also to support anytime, anywhere access 
to services and information. The integration of WLANs and LANs gives rise to a 
number of security concerns, some of which have been adequately addressed, but 
others remain a topic of active research.

Wireless Personal 
Area Networks
A wireless personal area network (WPAN) focuses on personal operating space 
around a person or object that typically extends within a 10-m radius. IEEE classi-
fies three classes of WPANs based on data rate, battery drain, and QoS.
	
1.	High-data-rate WPAN: Defined in the 802.15.3 standard, is suitable for  
multimedia applications that requires high QoS.
	
2.	Medium-rate WPAN: Defined in the 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) standard, handles 
various tasks such as cell phones and PDA communications and supports 
QoS for voice applications.
	
3.	Low-rate WPAN (LR-WPAN): Defined in the 802.15.4 standard, is targeted 
at applications with lower power consumption and cost requirements not 
considered in other WPAN classes. LR-WPAN is characterized by a low data 
rate, on the order of a few hundred kilobits. The 802.15.4 standard is dis-
cussed in detail in Chapter 5.
In addition to the above standards, the HomeRF Working Group (HRFWG) 
defines the HomeRF standard that is also meant for WPAN.
4.1	
HomeRF
The consortium of companies that formed the HRFWG was disbanded in 2003 and 
has ceased to develop, promote, or distribute the HomeRF specification. However, 

66  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
the specification is discussed briefly to compare it with other WPAN technologies 
and show the evolution of the technology.
Figure 4.1 shows the HomeRF protocol stack that defines the MAC and physi-
cal layers to support wireless voice and data networking in a residential area. The 
Shared Wireless Access Protocol (SWAP) is the product of cooperation between 
the industry and HRFWG to develop a protocol for radio-based home networks. 
The specification defines a common air interface to support wireless voice and LAN 
data services in the home. It provides higher data rates and ensures interoperability 
between different vendor products.
SWAP operates in the 2.4-GHz band and combines elements of digital enhanced 
cordless telecommunication (DECT) and the IEEE 802.11 standards. TDMA is 
used to deliver time-critical services, and CSMA/CA is used to deliver high-speed 
data. Because it closely resembles the IEEE 802.11 MAC and PHY layers, and is a 
subset of DECT standard, the SWAP MAC layer can support both data-oriented 
service and voice service.
A SWAP system can operate as either:
An ad hoc network that supports data communications only. It is a peer-

distributed between stations.

Bluetooth Technology
Bluetooth, conceived in 1994 by Ericsson Mobile Communications, is a personal 
area network (PAN) technology that has received a lot of attention. The name 
Bluetooth comes from the Danish King Harald Blåtand (Bluetooth in English) 
who united the Scandinavian countries for the first time. Bluetooth technology has 
brought together major players in the telecommunication industries, such as Erics-
son, Intel, Toshiba, and Nokia to name just a few.
Bluetooth technology aims to be rid of cables by providing wireless connec-
tions between communication devices—for example, a PDA, a hand phone, and a 
laptop—so that you can transfer data between these devices seamlessly without the 
hassle of connecting them with cables. The aims of the technology are:
To provide low power radio chip that can be installed in any device without 
N
N
causing power drain.
To offer low-priced Bluetooth chips that are affordable for most people—the 
N
N
targeted price is US$5.
To have a small footprint because it is intended to be embedded in small 
N
N
devices.
To enable both speech and data transmission, preferably simultaneously.
N

4.2.1	 Basic Operation
Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed 2.4-GHz ISM band (2402–2480 Hz). Because 
this is the same frequency band for WLANs and microwave ovens, the technology 
has to be robust in handling interference. The channel access technique used is 

68  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
FHSS. A data rate of 1 Mbps is achieved using Gaussian-shaped frequency shift 
keying (GFSK) modulation. The spectrum is divided into 79 channels with each 
channel allocated a bandwidth of 1 MHz. It supports both point-to-point and 
point-to-multipoint connections.
Devices within communication range of each other form a piconet. Communi-
cations in a piconet are controlled by a device that acts as a master. Other devices 
act as slaves. At any one time, there can only be one master device and seven active 
slaves in a piconet. There can be up to 255 slaves in park mode that do not exchange 
data but synchronize with the master. Two or more overlapping piconets form a 
scatternet. A device can be a member of more than one piconet but can act as 
master in only one piconet. Figure 4.2 shows two piconets that overlap to form a 
scatternet. A scatternet enables a multihop wireless network where two nodes can 
communicate with one another even though they are not directly connected by 
using intermediate nodes as relays.
When a device is powered on, it may operate as a master or slave device. First, 
it has to listen for a master’s inquiry for new devices and respond to it. This phase 
allows the master to know the address of the slave device. It also allows the device 
to learn the master’s address and the clock phase that is used to compute the fre-
quency hopping sequence that is unique to the piconet. The master determines the 
frequency hopping sequence (based on its Bluetooth address) and the phase of the 
hopping sequence (based on its clock). Once the slave’s address is known, the mas-
ter may open a connection with the slave provided the slave is listening for paging 
requests. If the slave responds to the paging request, the master and slave synchro-
nize over the frequency hopping sequence. After a connection is established, the 
devices may authenticate each other before they start communicating. The con-
nection may be torn down after communication is completed, and the device may 
enter one of the power-saving modes (PSMs).

A Bluetooth device has a range of 10 m. Bluetooth supports the allocation of up 
to 20 piconets, each with a maximum aggregate data transfer rate of 400 kbps.
4.2.2	 Bluetooth Protocol Stack
The Bluetooth protocol stack allows devices to locate and connect to others to 
facilitate data exchange and execute interoperable, interactive applications. The 
protocol stack consists of three components (Figure 4.3):
	
1.	Transport protocol group: This group consists of the Logical Link Control 
Adaptation Layer Protocol (L2CAP), link manager, baseband, radio, and host 
controller interface (HCI) layers (Figure 4.4). It provides a means for Bluetooth 
devices to locate each other. It supports the creation, configuration, and man-
agement of physical and logical links so that higher layer protocols and applica-
tions can pass data through the transport protocols.
	
2.	Middleware protocol group: This group consists of the RF communications 
(RFCOMM), Service Discovery Protocol (SDP), telephony control specifica-
tion (TCS), and audio layers (Figure 4.4). It utilizes the transport protocols 
and presents standard interfaces to the application layer for communication 
across the transports. It includes third-party and industry standard proto-
cols (e.g., IPs, wireless application protocols, Infrared Data Association) in 
addition to protocols defined specifically for Bluetooth. Three protocols are 
designed specifically for Bluetooth: RFCOMM (provides support for legacy 
applications that interface with a serial port to operate seamlessly over Blue-
tooth transport protocols), TCS (for advanced telephony operations), and 
mobility support for cordless handsets and BSs.
	
3.	Application group: This consists of applications that utilize Bluetooth 
links. These may be legacy applications unaware of Bluetooth transports or  
Bluetooth-aware applications.

70  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Figure 4.4 shows the Bluetooth protocol stack. Each layer in the protocol stack 
performs a set of defined functions:
Radio: The Bluetooth radio layer defines parameters to optimize over-the-air 
N
N
packet transmissions for short-range wireless communications.
Baseband: Provides the functionality for air interface packet framing and the 
N
N
establishment and maintenance of piconets and link control. It defines the 
master and slave roles, how devices find each other, and the establishments 
of connections. It also determines the frequency hopping sequences and how 
the air interface is shared between synchronous and asynchronous traffic.
Link manager: Responsible for link setup and control. Also handles authen-
N
N
tication, encryption, QoS, transmission scheduling, and physical parameters 
control.
HCI: Provides a mechanism for the higher layers to delegate the decision on 
N
N
whether to accept connections to the link manager. Also decides whether to 
switch on filters at the link manager. The radio, baseband, and link man-
ager may be packaged into one module. The HCI layer defines a common 
interface to access the module to allow interoperability between modules by 
different vendors. HCI offers a single standard interface for the upper layers 
to access the lower layers. The module uses HCI commands to enter certain 
modes of operation, for example, an authentication operation.
Control: Relays control information between layers. For example, L2CAP 
N
N
notifies the link manager of its expected QoS or an application may send 
control information to set the power-saving mode for the device.

L2CAP: Provides connection-oriented and connectionless data services. It 
N
N
provides functions to perform protocol multiplexing, SAR, and QoS support. 
Version 1.2 of the Bluetooth specification allows IP to be implemented over 
L2CAP. The master-slave concept does not propagate to higher layers. From 
L2CAP and above, communication is based on a peer-to-peer model, and 
there is no provision for different actions for a master or slave device.
RFCOMM: Emulates serial ports. Because most serial communication 
N
N
involves a cable for transferring data across serial ports, Bluetooth has to pro-
vide support for serial communications for the initial cable-replacement usage 
model. For example, legacy applications that benefit from this feature are peer-
to-peer file transfer and data synchronization. RFCOMM provides a virtual 
serial port to facilitate smooth migration of applications modeled for cabled 
serial communications to wireless communications.
SDP: Unlike wired networks where services are provided by servers through 
N
N
static configurations, devices forming an ad hoc network cannot rely on 
servers to provide the services they require. SDP allows Bluetooth devices 
to discover what services are available in neighboring devices. SDP defines a 
standard method for Bluetooth devices to discover each other’s presence and 
the services offered by one another. For example, a Bluetooth-enabled camera 
uses SDP to detect whether there is a digital printer nearby.
TCS and audio: TCS provides telephony functions such as call control and 
N
N
group management. TCS is used to set up the call parameters. Once a call is 
established, the audio channel carries the voice content. TCS is compatible 
with the Q.931 specification. It is suitable for mobile office workers and small 
office or home office environments.
4.2.3	 Frequency Hopping
If you want to listen to the broadcast of your favorite radio station, you have to 
tune to the frequency at which it is broadcast. Radio stations always broadcast at 
the same frequency. When we transmit data over the air, we can also take the same 
approach. However, this is not always a good idea because of interference and secu-
rity concerns. Broadcasting at the same frequency all the time makes it easier for 
eavesdroppers to listen to transmissions. Using the frequency hopping technique, 
the frequency at which data is transmitted is changed periodically. An advantage of 
frequency hopping is that if interference occurs at a certain frequency band, only a 
very small number of packets will be affected and the corrupted packets are retrans-
mitted later. Because the packet size is small, frequency hopping is more robust to 
interference. Figure 4.5 illustrates how frequency hopping works. Channel 1 (C1) 
hops from F1 to F4 to F2 to F3 to F1. If interference occurs on F2, only one packet 
might be lost.

72  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
A Bluetooth device changes its transmission frequency at a rate of 1600 times 
per second. The transmission frequency remains unchanged for 625-μs long slots. 
Each slot is assigned a sequence number. The master transmits in even slots, and a 
slave transmits in odd slots. A message may last for one, three, or five consecutive 
slots. Another advantage of frequency hopping is it provides a degree of security 
because only a receiver that knows the frequency hopping pattern can receive and 
assemble all packets of a message.
4.2.4	 The Bluetooth Protocol
Bluetooth defines two types of links: asynchronous connectionless link (ACL) and 
synchronous connection-oriented link (SCO). An SCO packet is fixed-length and 
fits into one slot with a fixed 64 kbps throughput. The packet length can be 10, 20, 
or 30 bytes. An ACL packet fits into one, three, or five slots. The payload length is 
from 17 to 339 bytes with symmetric throughput ranging from 108.8–433.9 kbps. 
Its asymmetric throughput is 732.2/57.6 kbps.
A SCO link provides guaranteed delay and bandwidth, not withstanding Link 
Manager Protocol messages that have higher priority. A slave may establish a maxi-
mum of three SCO links with the same master or two SCO links with different 
masters. On the other hand, a master may establish a maximum of three SCO links 
with three different slaves. The SCO’s 64-kbps constant bit rate symmetric chan-
nel is suitable for streaming applications such as average quality voice and music. 
It provides limited reliability. There is no retransmission nor is CRC applied to the 
payload. Forward error correction (FEC) is offered as an option.
ACL provides support for non-real-time traffic. Only one ACL link may be 
established between a slave and the master, meaning that it cannot support appli-

cations with different QoS parameters. The master determines a schedule that is 
used by a slave to exchange packets, one at a time, with the master. ACL links may 
be symmetric or asymmetric with different preset bandwidths. A 16-bit CRC is 
applied to the payload for error protection. Optional features offered are 2/3 FEC 
convolutional code and ARQ. ACL links are configured via an interface offered by 
the link manager. Parameters that can be configured are:
Type of QoS: None, best effort, and guaranteed best effort (default).

A slave specifies the value of the parameters in a request to the master that is 
handled by the admission control function implemented by the master’s link man-
ager. If the master accepts the QoS request, it configures the link with the slave by 
setting two parameters:
	
1.	Poll interval: The maximum time interval between two consecutive 
transmissions
	
2.	NBC: The number of retransmissions for broadcast packets
Violation of the QoS parameters may be communicated to the upper layers by the 
link manager.
4.2.5	 Bluetooth Security
All Bluetooth headers are protected by an 8-bit CRC. Datagram payloads on ACL 
links are protected by a 16-bit CRC, but stream payloads on SCO links are not pro-
tected. A Bluetooth packet may be protected by 1/3 FEC, 2/3 FEC, or not at all.
Bluetooth specifies three security modes:
Mode 1: Not secure
Mode 2: Service level enforced security (after channel establishment)
Mode 3: Link level enforced security (before channel establishment)
Authentication and encryption are handled by the following entities:

each device
There are two security levels: trusted and nontrusted. There are three levels 
of service: open services, services requiring authentication, and services requir-
ing authentication and authorization. A personal ID number (PIN) code that is 
between 1 and 16 octets must be entered at initialization of each communicating 
device. The PIN may also be hardwired in the device.
Communicating devices authenticate each other using a shared secret termed as 
a link key. The link key is established during a session called pairing during which 
the link key is computed using the address of each device, a random number, and a 
shared secret (PIN). If both parties need to be authenticated, the pairing process is 
executed twice—once for each party. The secret key can be entered manually when 
the device is used for the first time or hardwired for paired devices that are always 
used together. Data encryption is performed using the E0 stream cipher. A unique 
encryption key is generated for each session. Per-packet keys are derived from the 
encryption key.
4.2.6	 Power Management
Bluetooth is designed specifically for portable devices with short range and limited 
battery power. On average, a Bluetooth device consumes between 1–35 mA of power, 
which is much lower compared to the 100–350 mA typically consumed by Wi-Fi 
devices. When a Bluetooth device is not connected, it is in standby mode. When a 
device is connected, it operates in one of the following modes:
AM: The device is active and listens to transmissions from the master. It 
N
N
receives packets to help it to remain synchronized with the master and 
informs it when it can transmit to the master. This state provides the fastest 
response time but also consumes the most power.
Sniff mode: This is a low-power consumption mode where the device listens 
N
N
only during sniff slots. A slave becomes active periodically. When a device 
is in sniff mode, the master transmits packets for that slave only at certain 
regular intervals, called sniff intervals. The slave listens for packets from the 
master only at the start of each interval. If it receives a packet at the start of 
the interval, it continues listening to receive the packet. Otherwise, it sleeps 
until the next interval. The power consumption and responsiveness of a slave 
in sniff mode depends on the length of the sniff interval.
Hold mode: A slave stops listening for packets from the master for a specified 
N
N
time interval, called a hold time, that is agreed to by the master and the slave. 
During the hold time, the device may establish links to other devices or it 
may sleep. It resumes listening to the master at the end of the hold time. This 

Wireless Personal Area Networks  75
mode allows greater power savings than sniff mode but may be less responsive 
than sniff mode, depending on the hold time.
Park mode: The device is not active but remains synchronized with the mas-
N
N
ter. Because there may be more than seven slaves in a piconet, the park mode 
allows the master to orchestrate communications in a piconet by exchanging 
active and parked slaves to maintain up to seven active connections. A parked 
slave maintains synchronization with the master by listening to the master 
periodically using a beaconing scheme. This mode consumes the least power 
and is also the least responsive.
4.2.7	 Bluetooth Usage Models
The usage models describe possible Bluetooth applications. The cordless computer 
usage model removes cables from computers, keyboards, mice, speakers, printers, 
scanners, and other computer peripherals. In addition to doing away with the has-
sles of dealing with cabling, it also offers freedom in placement and uses. Devices 
such as a keyboard or a mouse can be moved at the user’s convenience without 
being constrained by the cable length. A printer can be shared without connecting 
it to a wired network: Move your laptop or the printer so that they are within range 
of each other, and you can print your document.
The headset usage model defines a headset that can be used not only with 
mobile phones but also with standard telephones. The latter is particularly useful, 
for example, at help desks and reservation offices where the receptionist needs to 
keep her hands free to use a computer. Because the headset is designed based on a 
standard specification, it can be used with multiple devices that adhere to the stan-
dard; for example, it can be used with a cordless telephone and for audio interaction 
with computers.
Nowadays, many people use three types of telephones: a telephone at home, 
another one at the office, and a mobile phone. Would it not be more convenient if 
we could use one telephone for all purposes? This is what the three-in-one phone 
usage model tries to accomplish. The three-in-one phone allows a mobile phone 
to be used as a cellular phone, as a cordless phone, and as an intercom or walkie-
talkie. Let us say you are out shopping and you need to make a phone call. Your 
mobile phone is able to detect your surroundings and establish a connection in the 
usual manner, and your service provider charges the normal call rate using a mobile 
phone. When you return home, your mobile phone is able to detect that you are 
home and acts as a cordless phone. Any calls you make are charged the standard 
landline call charge. When you are at the office, your mobile phone detects your 
surroundings and allows you to use the phone as a walkie-talkie to talk to a col-
league. In this case, no call charge is incurred.
The file transfer usage model allows temporary links to be set up quickly between 
devices to exchange files and other data objects such as business cards. It provides 

76  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
support for quick data exchange at meetings and conferences without the hassle of 
setting up and configuring a network among the devices.
The Internet bridge usage model provides two methods for using Bluetooth as a 
bridge to establish networks. The first method connects a computer to the Internet 
using a telephone to dial to an Internet Service Provider minus the cables. Assuming 
the computer and the telephone support the dial-up networking profile, a connec-
tion to the Internet is achieved wirelessly. A traveling user can connect to the Inter-
net without having to wait to return to the hotel to plug in his modem to dial up to 
the corporate network. Figure 4.6a illustrates the dial-up networking usage model. 
The second method is direct network access and is typically used in enterprises and 
similar environments. Direct network access is achieved via a Bluetooth data AP 
that allows Bluetooth devices to connect to it wirelessly (Figure 4.6b). The data  
AP is connected to a LAN. This profile allows the LAN to be extended using a data 
AP without requiring any cabling between the AP and the devices.
A user is likely to use a number of devices during a workday. The PC is used 
to access information while at the office. The PDA is used to access the corporate 
database while meeting a customer. The mobile phone is used for a quick discussion 
with the boss. While meeting with the customer, the user may update the calendar 
and add a task to the to-do list using the PDA. Back at the office, the user updates 
the calendar and to-do list on the PC manually. The automatic synchronizer usage

by proximity networking, which is when two devices automatically synchronize 
whenever they come within range of each other.
The instant postcard usage model allows a photo taken with a digital camera to be 
sent to a laptop or mobile phone and later e-mailed to friends and family. This is use-
ful not only for personal use (e.g., sending holiday photos), but also for commercial 
use (e.g., sending a photo of an antique grandfather clock to a potential customer).
The usage models discussed above give an overview of what is possible with 
Bluetooth technology. Applications that would be enabled by this technology, how-
ever, are not limited to the ones described above. What is possible is limited only by 
the creativity of the designers.

IEEE 802.15.3 Standard
IEEE 802.15.3 is designed to support ad hoc networking and multimedia QoS guaran-
tees, where a node may join or leave a group or subnetwork, and plays the role of a mas-
ter or slave node. The physical layer is similar to the one defined for 802.11b. It operates 
in the 2.4-GHz band at 11 Mbaud. It is designed to achieve data rates between 11 to 
55 Mbps to support high-definition video and high-fidelity audio. Table 4.1 shows 
the modulation format and data rates defined in the 802.15.3 standard. The signals 
occupy a bandwidth of 15 MHz, allowing for up to four fixed channels.
The superframe structure is shown in Figure 4.7. The beacon contains network-
specific parameters, such as information for new devices to join the network and power 
management. The beacon is followed by time slots of the contention access period 
(CAP) that makes use of CSMA/CA. CAP is for the transmission of frames that 
do not require a QoS guarantee. CAP is followed by time slots allocated under the 
guaranteed time slots (GTS) period. GTS is used for the transmission of image files, 
standard and high-definition video (e.g., Motion Picture Experts Group formats—
MPEG1, MPEG2), and high quality audio.
The 802.15.3 standard is optimized for short-range transmission—a maximum 
distance of 10 m. It keeps costs low and allows integration into small consumer 
devices. The physical layer requires low power consumption, less than 80 mA, while 
actively receiving or transmitting data.

Home Area Networks
Activities in a home are different from activities in offices (Meyer and Rakotoni-
rainy 2003). Office activities are more formal, structured, and task-oriented and 
aim to optimize productivity. Activities at home are less structured—people are 
free to decide how to organize their time and activities and with whom they inter-
act. The social interactions that happen at the office also differ from the ones at 
home. A system that is useful in an enterprise environment is not necessarily suit-
able at home.
In an enterprise environment, an investment is only made on systems that deliver 
cost savings or productivity gains. The system should be easily installed and main-
tained and should not require users to have sound technical knowledge to keep it 
up and running. A system in an enterprise environment must take the necessary 
measures to protect data and intellectual property from competitors. Thus, security 
is a critical feature that must be incorporated into the system. On the other hand, 
designing a context-aware system for homes presents a different set of challenges. A 
home area network should give real personal value and must fulfill usability, social 
acceptance, privacy protection, low-cost and zero administration requirements. Zero 
administration is important because, unlike an office environment, home users do 
not have skilled technical personnel to assist them with setting up or configuring the 
system.
To be useful, a context-aware home has to be aware of its occupants’ contexts, 
desires, whereabouts, activities, needs, emotions, and situations. This awareness 
enables it to adapt its interaction with the occupants. Context is measurable and 
relevant information that effect an occupant’s behavior. Context information must 
be gathered as unobtrusively as possible and with the least effort from the occu-
pants. Therefore, information is gathered mostly by sensors and not via user input.
A context-aware home is made of the following components:

4.4.1	 Instruments for a Context-Aware Home
Because most context information should be gathered with very minimal input 
from the user, sensors are used extensively in a context-aware home. The types of 
sensors used may vary because it is unlikely that one type of sensor will be suitable 
for an application. It is likely that data from multiple sensors is combined to increase 
the meaningfulness of the derived context and to improve error detection and cor-
rection. Sensors may be attached to objects or people to gather context information. 
Alternatively, unobtrusive video cameras may also be used to monitor the occu-
pants, objects, and their environment.
4.4.2	 Choosing Sensors for a Context-Aware Home
There are three main approaches to protecting privacy:
	
1.	Try to minimize the amount of information that flows out of a system.
	
2.	Restrict the amount of information acquired and stored to a minimum.
	
3.	Give users more control and awareness over the collection and use of personal 
information so that they can choose if they are willing to give up certain parts 
of their privacy for more convenience.
The advantages of installing video cameras and intelligent image-processing 
systems are that only a few are needed to cover the whole house and no sensors need 
to be attached to the occupants or other objects. Image-processing identifies and 
tracks the location of a person. A drawback of using a camera is its intrusiveness, 
and an alternative to using it is to use smart mobile devices or wearable computers 
to gather and process contextual information. This approach gives a person more 
control over what and when data is collected. If you decide to “disappear,” you 
simply switch off your device or take it off.
A context-aware system comprises the following components (Figure 4.8):
Hardware abstraction layer: It decouples the context manager software from 
N
N
the actual implementation of sensors and the communication infrastructure. 
The type of sensor, type of network, transfer protocol, and security policy 
should not have any affect on the context manager. The addition and removal 
of new sensors should be detected automatically, and the network should 
automatically reconfigure itself to accommodate the change.
Context manager: Derives meaningful context information from the raw 
N
N
data collected by sensors. Information can also be provided by users, and this 
is termed profiled information.
Privacy manager: Users should be able to choose which privacy information 
N
N
they want to gain more convenience from. They should also be able to grant or 
reject rights to other family members, guests, or smart objects in the home.

Wireless Personal Area Networks  81
To gain users’ acceptance, a context-aware home should be pleasant, personal-
ized, and easy to use, and it must offer solutions to real-life problems. One of the 
appealing aspects of a smart home is the time savings gained from the ability to 
control devices in the house. Usability of software and UI is critical. Usability is 
defined as the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction that users find in achieving 
specific goals in a particular environment.

Summary
Bluetooth is the most popular WPAN standard. It operates in the unlicensed 2.4-
GHz ISM band. The channel access technique used is FHSS. A data rate of 1 Mbps is 
achieved using GFSK modulation. Initially, a Bluetooth device had a range of 10 m, 
but this has now increased to 100 m. Devices within communication range of each 
other form a piconet. Overlapping piconets form a scatternet.
Another WPAN standard is IEEE 802.15.3, which is designed to support ad 
hoc networking and multimedia QoS guarantees. A node may join or leave a group 
or subnetwork and play the role of a master or slave node. It operates in the 2.4-
GHz band at 11 Mbaud and is designed to achieve data rates between 11 and 55 
Mbps to support high-definition video and high-fidelity audio.
Use of WPANs are not restricted to offices—it can also be used to build home 
networks. Even though the same technology can be used at an office and in a home, 
the way it is used is markedly different because activities in a home are different from 
activities in an office. Office activities are more formal, structured, and task-oriented, 
and they aim to optimize productivity; activities at home are less structured—people 
are free to decide how to organize their time, activities, and interactions. The social 
interactions that happen at the office also differ from the ones at home. Even though 
WPAN may be used to share information in the office and at home, a home network 
is more likely to be used for entertainment. Regardless of how WPAN technology is 
utilized, security and privacy remain important concerns.

Wireless Sensor  
Networks
A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a collection of sensor nodes that are distributed 
in a selected geographical area to monitor certain aspects of the environment. It 
incorporates technologies from three areas: sensing, communications, and comput-
ing. A sensor node performs the following functions:
Senses environmental physical parameters, for example, temperature, vibra-
N
N
tion, humidity
Processing of raw data locally to extract characteristic features of interest
N
N
Temporary storage of the data
N
N
Uses the wireless link to transmit data to its neighbors
N
N
The usage of WSN can be classified into three categories: monitoring space 
(e.g., environmental and habitat monitoring, precision agriculture, indoor climate 
control, intelligent alarms), monitoring objects (e.g., structural monitoring, eco-
physiology, medical diagnostic, urban terrain mapping), and monitoring interac-
tion between objects with each other and the encompassing space (e.g., wildlife 
habitats, disaster management, emergency response). A sensor node is also referred 
to as a mote or a probe.
This chapter discusses how sensor networks are used for various purposes and 
the architecture and protocols involved in building a WSN. It starts with an over-
view of WSN applications.

84  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
5.1	
Applications of WSNs
WSN technology enables monitoring in remote or dangerous locations that were 
rarely studied due to inaccessibility. Before designing and installing a WSN for 
environmental monitoring, an understanding of its physical environment is imper-
ative, for example, the system must be able to withstand conditions such as extreme 
temperature or vibration.
WSN allows the monitoring of a habitat without requiring heavy and bulky 
equipment. For example, Culler et al. (2004) conducted a study for environmental 
monitoring in collaboration with a biologist. Instead of hauling a suite of instru-
ments weighing 13.5 kg up a tree with cables dangling down to the forest floor, an 
entire wireless weather station fits in a tube about the size of a film canister. Sixteen 
sensor nodes were placed at four elevations in a 35-m redwood tree. The sensors 
monitor humidity, barometric pressure, and temperature. For example, the sensors 
collect data every five minutes and compute an average temperature at each eleva-
tion. The measurements show that there is a climatic weather variation between 
the top of the tree and the forest floor. The variation of several factors, such as 
photosynthesis rate, water transport rate, and the scale of respiration, influence the 
microclimate around a tree and, in turn, influence the habitat dynamics of species 
in and on the tree.
The GlacsWeb project (Martinez et al. 2004) monitors a glacial environment. 
The monitoring of ice caps and glaciers provides information about global warm-
ing and climate change. It focuses on how the ground on which glaciers rest affects 
their movement. Nine probes are embedded at the ice-sediment boundary at the 
depth of 50–80 m. The probes must be nonintrusive and mimic the movement 
of stones and sediment under the ice. A probe is composed of temperature and 
tilt sensors, a snow meter, a Webcam, and a differential GPS (dGPS) to follow ice 
movement. The probes are scheduled to wake up every four hours to take readings, 
and a real-time clock (RTC) powers off between readings.
Motion monitoring involves the monitoring of physical structures, such as 
machines, airplanes, and bridges, where variations in behavior indicates wear, 
fatigue, or other mechanical changes. For example, vibration sensors are attached 
to various pieces of a machine, and every few months, a team of electricians tours 
the plant and collects readings from the sensors. The data is sent to a central com-
puter that analyze it for signs of wear. Appropriate steps can then be taken to repair 
or replace components in the machine based on the analysis of the data. Alterna-
tively, instead of the electrician team touring the plant, the WSN can be configured 
to send the collected data to a central computer periodically.
The examples given above show that sensor nodes are used in different envi-
ronmental surroundings. Sensor nodes must be designed to withstand the possibly 
harsh environment they are embedded in. In addition, there are a few other com-
mon requirements for sensor nodes.

Wireless Sensor Networks  85
5.2	
Requirements for WSNs
Because WSNs are often deployed in remote areas that are not easily accessible, 
sensor nodes should be:
Low cost because a large number may be required to monitor an environment
N
N
Unobtrusive but durable under a range of environmental stresses
N
N
Energy efficient so that they can remain in situ with little human interaction
N
N
Robust to withstand errors and failures
N
N
Low polluting
N
N
Maintenance-free for years at a time
N
N
Able to reliably interconnect with a cyber-infrastructure that permits frequent 
N
N
network access for data upload, device programming, and management
Its communication requirements are omnidirectional high-power probes, long-
range communication between BSs and the reference station, a low data rate, error 
detection and corrections, and backup channels. Traditional network abstractions 
are unsuitable for WSNs, for example, operating systems for such networks must 
tightly integrate wireless connectivity.
5.3	
WSN Architecture
There are three types of architecture: infrastructure-based architecture, ad hoc 
architecture, and infrastructure-assisted architecture. In an infrastructure-based 
architecture, a sensor node registers with a BS and all communications are done 
via the BS. A node sends a packet destined for another node to the BS. If the 
destination node is registered with the BS, the BS forwards it to the destina-
tion node. Referring to Figure 5.1, node C sends a packet to node A via BS1. 
Otherwise, the packet is forwarded to another BS where the destination node 
is registered. For example, when node G sends a packet to node I, BS1 forwards 
the packet to BS2 who then delivers it to node I. The advantage of infrastruc-
ture-based architecture is that it is simple and there are no power restrictions 
on the BSs.
In an ad hoc architecture, there is no BS. If the destination node is within 
the range of the node, the packet is sent directly to the destination. Otherwise, 
the packet is relayed via intermediate nodes that forward it to the intended node. 
Referring to Figure 5.2, node C sends a packet to node F directly because they are 
within transmission range of each other. However, when node A sends a packet to 
node J, it has to be routed via node F and node I. This approach is termed multihop 
transmission. The advantages of this architecture are its versatility, lower power 
consumption, and easy, quick deployment in remote areas.

86  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
An infrastructure-assisted architecture is a hybrid of the previous two architec-
tures. A node outside the range of the BS could use other nodes to relay packets to 
the BS. A packet may or may not go through the BS depending on the location of 
the source and destination nodes. Referring to Figure 5.3, node A sends a packet 
to node F directly because they are within transmission range. Node G, which is 
not within transmission range of the BS, has to route its packet via node C. The BS 
then delivers the packet to its intended destination, node B. Two or more different 
infrastructure-based networks can exchange packets by relaying packets through 
the sensor nodes thus forming a single network. An example of this application are 
building sensors that relay information to BSs located in the building. The informa-
tion can be made available to control rooms and remote locations, if necessary.
5.4	
The 802.15.4 Standard
The 802.15.4 standard was developed for LR-WPAN. It is a global standard designed 
to address the needs of low data rates, low power consumption, and low-cost wire-

less networking among inexpensive fixed, portable, and moving devices in residen-
tial and industrial environments. Why can existing standards, such as Bluetooth, 
not be used for this purpose? Bluetooth is unsuitable because to support a wider 
range of applications and provide QoS, it has become more complex. The 802.15.4 
standard defines only 45 MAC primitives and 14 PHY primitives—one-third the 
total number defined in Bluetooth. Bluetooth’s complexity makes it inappropriate 
for certain simple applications requiring low costs and low power consumption. 
Among applications that benefit from the 802.15.4 standard are:
Automation and control in homes, factories, and warehouses
N
N
Monitoring for public safety (e.g., floods), health, and environment (e.g., 
N
N
gas leaks)
Entertainment (e.g., learning games and interactive toys)
N
N
The standard supports one-hop star and multihop peer-to-peer topologies. There 
are two types of devices: full function devices (FFDs) and reduced function devices 
(RFDs). An FFD is required to support all 45 MAC primitives and can function in 
any topology. It can talk to reduced function devices (RFDs) and FFDs. It operates 
in one of three modes: PAN coordinator, coordinator, or device. A RFD is required 
to support 38 MAC primitives under minimal configuration. Its use is limited to 
star topology. It can only talk to a FFD and is meant for very simple applications. 
It cannot act as a network coordinator. A network requires at least one FFD as a 
network coordinator. Endpoint devices may be RFDs to reduce cost.
The standard only defines the PHY layer and the data link layer (DLL) (Fig-
ure 5.4). The network and upper layers are addressed by ZigBee.
5.4.1	 The DLL
The DLL is divided into two sublayers: MAC and logical link control (LLC). MAC 
provides support for association and disassociation, acknowledged frame delivery,

channel access mechanism, frame validation, guaranteed time slot management, 
and beacon management. The association and disassociation functions allow for an 
automatic setup of a star network and the creation of a self-configuring peer-to-peer 
network. LLC is common among the 802 standards, such as 802.3 and 802.11.
The MAC frame (Figure 5.5) is known as the MAC PDU and consists of the 
MAC header, MAC SDU, and MAC footer. The MAC header specifies the MAC 
frame being transmitted, the format of the address field (8-bit or 64-bit address), 
and acknowledgment. The address field varies between 0 and 20 bytes because a 
data frame would contain source and destination information but an acknowledg-
ment frame does not contain any address information. The maximum MAC frame 
size is 127 bytes.
There are four types of frames: beacon, data, acknowledgment, and command. 
The data and beacon frames contain information sent by the higher layers. The 
acknowledgment and command frames originate from the MAC layer and are used 
for peer-to-peer communications.

The frame check sequence field is used to verify the integrity of the data frame. 
A transaction is deemed successful when the sequence number in an acknowledg-
ment frame matches the one in a previously transmitted data frame.
The network operates in either beacon-enabled mode or non-beacon-enabled 
mode (Figure 5.6). In beacon-enabled mode, a coordinator broadcasts beacons peri-
odically to synchronize the attached devices to identify the PAN and to describe 
the structure of superframes. In non-beacon-enabled mode, a coordinator does not 
broadcast beacons periodically, but may unicast a beacon to a device that is solicit-
ing beacons.
An optional superframe mode is defined to support low latency communication. 
A dedicated network coordinator, termed a PAN coordinator, transmits superframe 
beacons in predetermined intervals between 15 ms and 245 s. The duration of a super-
frame is announced to the attached network devices by the coordinator in its beacon. 
The time between two beacons is divided into 16 equal time slots that are indepen-
dent of the duration of the superframe (Figure 5.7). A device that wishes to transmit 
during the CAP has to compete with other devices using CSMA/CA. Alternatively, 
the coordinator may assign time slots to a device that requires dedicated bandwidth 
or low latency transmission. The assigned time slots are known as GTS. The coor-
dinator may allocate up to seven GTSs, and a GTS may occupy more that one slot 
period. The GTS consists of a CFP that always appears at the end of the active super-
frame starting at a slot boundary immediately following CAP. A sufficient portion of 
CAP remains for contention-based access and all contention-based transactions must 
be completed before CFP begins. A device transmitting in GTS must make sure that 
its transmission is complete before the next GTS or the end of the CFP.
An important function performed by MAC is acknowledging the successful 
reception of a frame. When a data or command frame has been successfully received 
and validated, an acknowledgment frame is returned immediately. A sender indi-
cates whether it expects an acknowledgment using the frame control field.

90  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Data is transferred from a device to a coordinator, from a coordinator to a 
device, or from a device to a peer in a peer-to-peer topology. There are three types 
of data transfers:
	
1.	Direct data transmission: Applies to all data transfers. Data transmission is 
handled using unslotted CSMA/CA or slotted CSMA/CA depending on 
whether non-beacon-enabled or beacon-enabled mode is used.
	
2.	Indirect data transmission: Applies only to data transfers from a coordinator 
to its devices. The coordinator keeps a transaction list and waits for extraction 
by the corresponding device. A device checks the beacon frames for pending 
packets from its coordinator. Unslotted CSMA/CA or slotted CSMA/CA is 
used in the data extraction procedure.
	
3.	Guaranteed time slot (GTS) data transmission: Applies only to data trans-
fers between a device and its coordinator. CSMA-CA is not needed in data 
transmission.
The standard provides three levels of security:
	
1.	No security: If security is not important, or if the upper layers provide suf-
ficient protection.
	
2.	Access control lists: Prevents unauthorized devices from accessing data.
	
3.	Symmetric key security: Employs AES-128 to protect data payload and pre-
vent attackers from impersonating legitimate devices by using an integrity 
code (IC).

The key distribution method is not specified in the standard to minimize the cost 
for devices, but may be included in the upper layers of the applications if needed.
5.4.2	 The PHY Layer
There are 14 PHY primitives with 2 PHY options that are based on DSSS methods:
	
1.	2.4-GHz PHY operates in the 2.4-GHz ISM band with data rate of 250 kbps.
	
2.	868/915-MHz PHY operates in the 868-MHz band in Europe and 915-MHz 
ISM band in the United States with data rates of 20 and 40 kbps, respectively.
Table 5.1 summarizes the characteristics of the PHY layer. The 868/915-MHz 
PHY supports one channel in the 868-MHz band and ten channels in the 915-
MHz band. The 2.4-GHz PHY supports 16 channels with a channel spacing of 5 
MHz to ease transmitting and receiving filter requirements. The standard defines a 
dynamic channel selection but the specific selection algorithm is left to the network 
layer. A scan function in the MAC layer steps through the list of supported chan-
nels to search for a beacon. Low-level functions defined in the PHY layers perform 
receiver energy detection, link quality indication, and channel switching to enable 
channel assessment and frequency agility.
Both PHY layers have the same frame structure (Figure 5.5). The PPDU con-
tains a synchronization header, a PHY header, and a PSDU. The synchronization 
header consists of a 32-bit preamble to attain symbol and chip timing. It may also 
be used for coarse frequency adjustment. Seven bits of the PHY header are used to 
specify the payload length in bytes. The maximum payload length is 127 bytes. A 
typical payload length for home appliances is expected to be between 30 and 60 
bytes. The maximum packet duration is 4.25 ms for the 2.4-GHz band, 26.6 ms for 
the 915-MHz band, and 53.2 ms for the 868-MHz band.
The transmission range is between 10 and 20 m but may be extended with a 
moderate increase in transmit power. A star topology can provide complete home 
coverage. Devices operating in the 2.4-GHz band are vulnerable to interference 
by other services operating in the same band. However, this is not a critical issue 
because the standard is targeted at applications with relatively low QoS require-
ments that do not require isochronous communication, and that are expected to

perform multiple retries occasionally for successful transmission. A critical require-
ment for the applications is long battery lifetime that is achieved by low transmit-
ting power and very low duty cycle operation. The devices are expected to be in 
sleep mode 99.9 percent of the time.
5.4.3	 Power-Saving Mechanisms
The 802.15.4 standard defines power-saving mechanisms that are based on the 
beacon-enabled mode. In direct data transmission, if the BatteryLifeExtension 
option is set to TRUE, the receiver of the beaconing coordinator is disabled after 
maxBattLifeExtPeriods (default value is 6) backoff periods following the inter-
frame space (IFS) period of the beacon frame. Using the default configuration, the 
transceiver of a coordinator or device is required to be turned on for only 1/64 of 
the duration of a superframe if there is no data to be exchanged.
In indirect data transmission, a device may enter a low-power state upon finding 
no pending packets when checking the beacon received from its coordinator. GTS 
data transmission also has a low duty cycle but it is considered costly for low data 
rate applications. The small CSMA/CA backoff period and short transceiver warm-
up time also help to further reduce power consumption.

The ZigBee Protocol
ZigBee operates on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard to address issues in the upper 
protocol layers and application profiles by adding logical network, security, and 
application software. ZigBee is promoted by 70 companies, such as Honeywell, 
Mitsubishi, Motorola, Philips, and Samsung, that form the ZigBee Alliance. Zig-
Bee was introduced because there was no standard that addressed the unique needs 
of remote and sensor network applications. Sensors and control devices do not need 
high bandwidth, but they need low latency and very low power consumption. There 
are various proprietary wireless systems, and the systems are often not interoperable. 
ZigBee Alliance offers a standardized base set of solutions to address these concerns. 
ZigBee offers product interoperability and vendor independence that result in a win-
win situation for consumers. The alliance hopes to produce ZigBee chips at a low 
price of $2(US) because low cost is an important requirement for sensor nodes.
ZigBee defines modules for quality assessment, receiver energy detection, and 
clear channel assessment. CSMA is used to determine which node may transmit 
to avoid collisions. The maximum distance between nodes is up to 70 m. ZigBee 
supports three network topologies: star, mesh, and cluster tree (a hybrid of the 
first two). It uses a master-slave configuration suitable for star networks comprising 
many infrequently used devices that transmit small data packets. It supports up to 
254 nodes and can be increased if necessary. Master nodes can talk to each other.

Wireless Sensor Networks  93
An important feature is that ZigBee incurs low latency. A node that is powered 
down can wake up and transmit a packet in about 15 ms. This feature is important 
for time-critical messages. For example, sensors operating in a nuclear plant need 
their messages transmitted immediately.
Operating on top of the 802.15.4 standard, a ZigBee network consists of nodes 
that may act as a coordinator (FFD), a router (FFD), or end device (FFD or RFD) 
as shown in Figure 5.8. A coordinator performs the following functions: sets up 
a network, transmits network beacons, manages network nodes, stores network 
node information, and routes messages between paired networks. A coordinator 
requires extra random-access memory (RAM) for the node database, transaction 
table, and pairing table. Typically, it operates in the receiving state. A network node 
searches for available networks, transfers data from its application or environment, 
determines whether there is data pending, and requests data from the network 
coordinator.

coverage by allowing clusters to be added. Networks can be consolidated or split.

5.5.1	 ZigBee versus Bluetooth
Why do we need ZigBee when there are already other standards, such as Bluetooth? 
Bluetooth and ZigBee are two solutions for two different application areas as illus-
trated in Table 5.2. ZigBee is designed for low to very low duty cycles in static and 
dynamic environments with low data rate requirements and many active nodes; 
whereas Bluetooth is designed for high QoS, a variety of duty cycles with moderate 
data rate requirement in networks with limited active nodes.

Table 5.3 compares the air interface of the two standards, and Table 5.4 com-
pares the timing characteristics. ZigBee devices can quickly attach, exchange infor-
mation, detach, and go into sleep mode to achieve their objective of extending 
battery lifetime to up to two years. Bluetooth, which is targeted for devices such as 
PDAs and mobile phones that require regular charging, is incapable of such effi-
ciency in power consumption.
5.6	
Power Conservation Techniques
Because most sensor nodes rely on batteries, energy consumption must be managed 
efficiently. Sensor nodes must be in sleep mode approximately 99.9% of the time to 
ensure a very long battery life. Among the power management strategies taken are 
turning on the transceiver only during active communication, shutting down the 
central processing unit (CPU) between request processing and powering down the 
input and output (I/O) subsystems when not in use. A number of factors including 
application requirements and the hardware used determines the timing of the power 
down cycle.
The network stack reduces power consumption by eliminating communica-
tion or by turning off the radio when there are no communication needs. Possible 
approaches to save power include processing data locally and only communicating 
when an event of interest is detected. Performing aggregation can reduce com-
munication and, hence, power consumption. For example, if an application has to 
determine the average temperature at shaded nodes in a certain geographic region, 
only a subset of nodes is selected for monitoring. The selection is performed at the

tree leaves, and nodes route their aggregated data upward. Each node transmits at 
most one packet to provide a statistical summary of its subtree.
Compression and scheduling conserve power at the lower levels. Control 
information can be piggybacked on data messages. Prescheduling reduces con-
tention and the time the radio remains active. The network may assign specific 
responsibilities, such as retransmission, to certain nodes. The network may reject 
packets that are not of interest by turning off the radio after receiving only a 
portion.
The targeted sensor lifetime for many applications is between two and five 
years. A sensor node operating on one 1.5-V AA alkaline battery with an average 
power consumption in the range of 100 to 10 µW would last between two and 
seven years. A radio transceiver consumes tens of milliwatts. To conserve power, a 
node must be put in sleep mode most of the time; this can be achieved by using a 
duty cycle on the order of 0.1 to 1 percent while keeping a low sleep mode current 
no larger than the battery leakage current. Reducing power consumption requires 
optimization across all layers. The MAC layer plays the most crucial role in the 
overall communication protocols energy efficiency, especially for network with low 
duty cycling radios.
Microcontrollers running at 10 MHz operate at 1 mW. In standby mode, the 
power consumption is about 1 µW. If a device is active 1 percent of the time, its 
average power consumption is only a few microwatts. The source power can be 
obtained from a number of sources, for example, solar cells (10 to 100 µW/cm2 
indoors) and vibration of windows and air-conditioning ducts (100 µW). A typical 
operating point for WSNs is one year on a pair of AA batteries.
Power consumption can also be minimized by reducing and eliminating energy 
waste caused by:
Idle listening: A node waits and listens for a packet to arrive.

Overemitting: A node sends a message and the destination node is not ready

Wireless Sensor MAC (WiseMAC) is a single-channel contention protocol 
based on nonpersistent CSMA (El-Hoiydi et al. 2004). It was designed to reduce 
power consumption for downlink transmissions in infrastructure WSNs. In this 
type of network, an AP has an unlimited power supply while the sensor nodes are 
constrained by battery power. A downlink transmission is a transmission from an 
AP to a sensor node. Because it is not possible to determine in advance when an AP 
would have a packet destined for a particular sensor node, the challenge is how to 
handle downlink transmission without requiring the sensor node to listen to the 
channel continuously as that would drain battery power. To accomplish this, we 
need to reduce or eliminate idle listening and overhearing.
Sensor nodes periodically sample the medium to check for transmission. This 
may be done to check if there is a packet intended for itself or to check if the 
medium is idle so that it may initiate transmission. All sensor nodes sample the 
medium periodically for a constant period, but their sampling schedule offsets are 
independent. If the medium is busy, the sensor node continues to listen until a data 
packet is received or until the medium becomes idle. Because there is no way for a 
node to ascertain if there is a packet pending, it has to continue listening until the 
medium is idle, consuming precious energy.
WiseMAC mitigates this problem by allowing the AP to learn the sampling 
schedule of all nodes so that it can schedule the transmission of a packet at the right 
time, thus reducing power consumption of the sensor node. The packet is preceded 
with a wake-up preamble to ensure that the node is awake when packet transmis-
sion starts. The AP maintains an up-to-date table of sampling schedules of all sen-
sor nodes under its responsibility. A sensor node piggybacks information about its 
remaining time until its next scheduled sampling in acknowledgment packets to 
the AP. The AP uses this information to update the sampling schedule table. Colli-
sions are not possible in the downlink channel because the AP is the only one that 
initiates transmission.
Polling is another mechanism that can be used to reduce power consumption. 
This is the approach used by the Periodic Terminal Initiated Polling (PTIP) pro-
tocol. Packets destined for sensor nodes are buffered at the AP, and sensor nodes 
regularly send POLL messages to retrieve the buffered packets. Upon receiving the 
POLL message, the AP returns the DATA packet, if there is one pending for the sen-
sor node. Otherwise, it sends a short control packet. POLL messages are sent using 
CSMA. The interval between POLLs is determined randomly to avoid contention 
between synchronized nodes. When a sensor node receives a correct response to 
a POLL, it sleeps until the time for the next polling. It is not required to send an 
acknowledgment for the correct response. If the correct response is not received, it 
keeps sending POLLs until the correct response is received. The sequence number 
of the last correctly received DATA is piggybacked in the next POLL to inform the 
AP that the DATA packet has been received correctly and, hence, does not need to 
be retransmitted.

98  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
The IEEE 802.15.4 standard takes a similar approach to PTIP. The standard defines 
a PSM that reduces power consumption at the cost of higher delay. This scheme con-
sists of a four-packet transmission: POLL-ACK-DATA-ACK. The AP buffers traffic 
destined for sensor nodes. A beacon that contains a traffic indication map (TIM) is 
transmitted periodically. TIM contains a list of sensor nodes with packets buffered at 
the AP. Sensor nodes wake up regularly to receive TIM, and if a node finds that it is 
on the list, it polls the AP to retrieve the buffered packet. When the AP receives the 
POLL message, it returns an ACK, which instructs the sensor node to remain in listen 
mode. The AP then finds the correct packet and sends the DATA packet to the sensor 
node. Upon receiving the packet, the sensor node returns an ACK.
Both WiseMAC and PSM makes use of a more bit in the data packet header to 
indicate that there are one or more data packets queued in the buffer for the sensor 
node. If the more bit is set to 1, it indicates that the sensor node should remain in 
listen mode after sending an acknowledgment as the next packet will be sent. PSM 
requires the sensor node to send another POLL to retrieve the next packet.
The various power conservation approaches may conflict with one another. A 
combination of different approaches may be deployed based on the requirements 
of an application.
5.7	
Network and Communications
Unlike traditional Internet applications, sensor network applications require pro-
tocols that are optimized for their unique communication patterns. Standards 
for sensor networks are 802.15.4 and the ZigBee protocol. The 802.15.4 standard 
specifies the RF channel and signaling protocol. ZigBee is built on top of 802.15.4 
and specifies the application-level communication protocol between devices. The 
802.15.4 standard determines which radio hardware to use, and ZigBee determines 
the content of the messages transmitted.
Unlike communications on the Internet, communications in WSNs are usu-
ally performed in aggregate. Participants are identified by attributes such as 
physical location or sensor value range. This style of routing, known as directed 
diffusion, is a process where nodes express interest in data by attribute. WSNs 
deploy disruption-tolerant networking (DTN), where bundles of data are trans-
ferred reliably hop by hop. The DTN model better suits the variable connectivity 
resulting from dynamic environments and the need to duty cycle.
Each sensor node has a radio that provides communication links to neighboring 
nodes. They perform a distributed algorithm to determine how to route data. The 
physical placement determines connectivity but other variables, such as obstruction, 
interference, and antenna orientation, make it difficult to determine connectivity a 
priori.
Sensors use radio broadcasts. The lowest layer controls the physical radio device. 
When one node transmits, the signal is received by a set of neighboring nodes 

Wireless Sensor Networks  99
unless it is garbled by another transmission. The link layer is responsible for avoid-
ing contention for the radio channel. It listens on the channel and transmits only 
when the channel is clear, which is similar to the way CSMA/CD works. When a 
node is not transmitting, it scans the channel for transmissions from other nodes. 
The packet layer manages buffers, schedules packets onto the radio, detects or cor-
rects errors, handles packet losses, and forwards packets to system or application 
components.
Disseminating information involves a flooding protocol. A root node broad-
casts a packet containing an ID. Receiving nodes retransmit the packet so that 
distant nodes can receive it. A node may receive different versions of the same 
message from different neighboring nodes. The ID in the packet is used to detect 
and discard duplicate packets. The network uses dissemination to issue commands, 
send alarms, and configure the network. Dissemination is also used to establish 
routes. Each packet identifies the transmitter and its distance from the root. A 
distributed tree is formed by identifying a node closer to the root. The network uses 
the reverse communication tree for data collection by routing data back to the root 
or for data aggregation by processing data at each level of the tree. The root may 
act as a gateway to a more powerful network or as an aggregation point within the 
sensor network.
For data from the sensors to be sent over long distances, data have to be routed 
hop by hop through nodes. Because communication is one of the most energy con-
suming operations, with each bit consuming as much energy as 1000 instructions, 
WSNs should process data within the network whenever possible.
5.8	
Configuration of Sensor Networks
Adaptive Self-Configuring sEnsor Networks Topologies (ASCENT) is a mecha-
nism that allows an adaptive self-configuration of sensor networks (Cerpa and 
Estrin 2004). As the density of sensors in an area increases, it is unnecessary for 
all nodes to be active simultaneously. Allowing the nodes to self-configure them-
selves by determining which nodes can be active while the others sleep allows 
the nodes to conserve energy that is critical for sensor nodes. ASCENT takes an 
adaptive approach because a centralized solution would pose all the restrictions 
of a centralized system, especially in terms of scalability and robustness. Because 
a single, central node cannot sense the conditions of other nodes, it has to be kept 
updated of the status of other nodes, thus, generating much traffic and consum-
ing more power to transmit or receive the updates. This mechanism assumes the 
following conditions:
Ad hoc deployment:
N
N
 It is unlikely that sensor nodes are uniformly distributed. 
Even if they are, it does not necessarily mean there is uniform connectivity 
due to unpredictable propagation effects.

100  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Energy constraints: Sensor nodes operate on battery power. It is imperative 
N
N
that energy consumption be minimized to prolong their lifetimes.
Unattended operation under dynamics: The high number of nodes in a sys-
N
N
tem rules out manual configuration. Environmental dynamics precludes 
design-time preconfiguration.
ASCENT adaptively selects active nodes from all nodes in the network. An 
active node stays awake and performs multihop packet routing. The remaining 
nodes remain passive and check periodically if they should become active. Refer-
ring to Figure 5.10a, initially, only a few nodes are active while the others are pas-
sively listening to packets but not transmitting. The source starts transmitting data 
packets toward the sink, but because the sink is at the limit of the radio range, there 
is very high packet loss from the source. This is termed a communication hole. To 
overcome this problem, the sink sends help messages to signal neighbors that are in 
listen-only mode, that is, passive neighbors, to join the network.
When a neighbor receives a help message, it may decide to join the network 
(Figure 5.10b). When a node joins the network, it starts transmitting and receiv-
ing packets, that is, it becomes an active neighbor. As soon as a node joins the 
network, it announces its active status to other passive neighbors by sending a 
neighbor announcement message. This continues until the number of active nodes 
stabilizes at a certain value and the cycle stops (Figure 5.10c). When the process is 
completed, the group of newly active neighbors that joined the network results in a 
more reliable data delivery from source to sink. The process restarts when a future 
network event (e.g., node failure) or environmental effect (e.g., new obstacle) causes 
an increase in packet loss.
A node may be in a sleep, passive, test, or active state. When a node is initially 
deployed, a random timer is turned on to avoid synchronization, and it is initialized 
in a test state. Nodes in the test state exchange data and routing control messages. 
A node in test state sets a timer Tt and sends neighbor announcement messages. If 
before Tt expires, the number of active neighbors exceeds the neighbor threshold 
(NT) or if the average data loss (downlink) rate is higher than the average loss 
before entering in the test state, the node moves into passive state. Otherwise, the 
node enters the active state when Tt expires. The purpose of the test state is to deter-
mine if the addition of a new node would improve connectivity.
When a node enters the passive state, it sets up a timer Tp and sends new passive 
node announcement messages that are used by active nodes to estimate the total 
density of nodes in the neighborhood. Active nodes transmit the density estimate 
to new passive nodes in the neighborhood. When Tp expires, the node enters the 
sleep state. If the following events occur before Tp expires, the node moves into the 
test state:

Table 5.5 summarizes the parameters used by ASCENT.
When in the passive (listen-only) state, nodes have their radios on and are able 
to overhear all packets transmitted by their active neighbors but they do not route 
or forward packets. The purpose of this state is to gather information regarding 
the state of the network without interfering with the other nodes. Energy is still 
consumed in the passive state because the radio is on. Nodes in the passive and 
test states continuously update the number of active neighbors and downlink rate 
values. A node that enters the sleep state turns off the radio, sets a timer Ts, and goes 
to sleep. The node moves into passive state when Ts expires.
A node in active state continues forwarding data and routing packets until it 
runs out of energy. If the downlink rate is less than LT, the active node sends help 
messages.
ASCENT has two advantages. First, its adaptivity allows applications to con-
figure the underlying topology based on their needs while conserving power to 
extend the network’s lifetime. It makes no assumption of a particular model of 
fairness, degree of connectivity, or capacity required. Second, it makes use of a 
self-configuring technique that reacts to operating conditions that are measured 
locally and that are not restricted to the radio propagation model, the geographical 
distribution of nodes, or the routing mechanisms.

WSN and Emergency Response Applications
Section 5.1 gives an overview of WSN applications in environment monitoring. 
Another important application is in emergency services and response. In a disaster 
scenario, quick and efficient action by first responders is critical to saving lives. An 
important aspect in disaster scenarios is that we cannot assume that any communi-
cation infrastructure will be available. For example, after an earthquake, there is a 
good chance that the existing communication infrastructure would be destroyed. 
Consequently, a wireless communication infrastructure that can be deployed 
quickly and with the least hassle is imperative to the search and rescue operation.
The emergency response applications discussed below are still in the experi-
mental stage, but the discussion gives you an idea of the great potential and the 
important role WSNs will play in the near future.
5.9.1	 CodeBlue Project
CodeBlue is a project at Harvard University that provides an infrastructure to sup-
port an emergency response application in disaster scenarios such as an earthquake 
(Lorincz et al. 2004). It is an integration of sensor nodes and various types of 
mobile devices to provide support for search and rescue operations. The sensor 
motes used for this application are different from a mobile device such as a PDA 
that has higher CPU speed, memory size, and communication capabilities. The 
motes have limited bandwidth and computational power, which rules out the use 
of common IPs. Support for the application comprises providing the facilities to 
form ad hoc networks, resource naming and discovery, security, and in-network 
aggregation of sensor-produced data.
The setting up of an ad hoc network is important to allowing the mobile devices 
to route data among themselves and from the disaster venue to a control center that 
then disseminates the relevant information to the emergency personnel. Because 
the devices have to share the limited bandwidth offered by 802.15.4 and ZigBee, 
data has to be prioritized. Critical data, such as data from a vital signs monitor from 
a victim in critical condition, is given priority.
Tracking rescue personnel and patients is an important aspect of the applica-
tion. For example, firefighters wear tags to allow easy tracking of their movements 
to coordinate search and rescue operations more effectively. The firefighters can be 
informed if a particular section of a building is unstable and about to collapse and 
directed to evacuate immediately. The RF-based tracking system is called ­MoteTrack 
and operates using low-power, single-chip transceiver. The beacon nodes for use in 
conjunction with MoteTrack can be used to replace existing smoke detectors so that 
it has a two-in-one function of detecting smoke and tracking location. The sen-
sor nodes broadcast periodic messages consisting of a tuple {sourceID, powerLevel}, 

104  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
where sourceID is the node unique identifier and powerLevel is the transmission 
power level used to transmit the message.
In cases where there is a high number of casualties, tractable vital signs sensors 
can be attached to the patients to aid quick location of a patient who suddenly 
needs immediate attention. Two types of vital signs sensors have been developed: 
a pulse oximeter and an ECG monitor. A pulse oximeter observes a patient’s heart 
rate and blood oxygen saturation by measuring the amount of light transmitted 
through a noninvasive sensor attached to his finger. The EKG monitor observes the 
heart’s electrical activity in patients who are severely injured. It is used to detect 
arrhythmia (abnormal heart beat rhythm) or ischemia (lack of blood flow and oxy-
gen to the heart) that indicates a potentially serious condition. Information from 
these sensor motes are transmitted to a PDA carried by first responders. The PDA is 
able to display vital signs information from more than one patient.
A patient’s medical record is confidential and its privacy must be guarded at 
all times. Devices and data must still be protected against common attacks, such 
as spoofing and denial of service (DoS) attacks; therefore, the handling of security 
and privacy issues for an emergency response application involves a new set of issues 
and conditions that do not exist in traditional applications. A search and rescue 
operation often involves personnel from different organizations, and it is unreason-
able to expect that they have exchanged security or configuration information a 
priori. It is also unreasonable to expect first responders to spend time typing pass-
words to set access permission to a database or to require them to do any manual 
configuration as it would distract them from critical tasks. In a life-threatening 
situation, denying or delaying a legitimate user access to data due to authentication 
procedures is not an option.
Consequently, CodeBlue makes use of a best-effort security model and its archi-
tecture provides support for an ad hoc network security model that does not require 
manual configuration and has the capability to self-organize participating devices. 
The system is designed to automatically cope with nodes joining and leaving the 
network. The security model provides seamless credential handoff from one first 
responder to another to grant access to the other, without requiring a preexisting 
relationship between them. This would be required when a patient is brought from 
the emergency site to the hospital, where access rights to the patient’s data must be 
transferred from the first responder to the medical team waiting at the hospital.
Data encryption is performed using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). ECC 
is chosen over RSA because it uses smaller keys and is more computationally effi-
cient. The implementation of ECC on Mica2 generates a key in 35 s. Even though 
it is not negligible, it is acceptable if a key is not generated frequently. Mica2 is a 
sensor mote that is based on a 7.3-MHz Atmel Atmega128L embedded controller 
with 4 Kbytes of RAM and 128 Kbytes of read-only memory.
A mobile node carried by or attached to a first responder who wishes to deter-
mine its location has to listen for a certain period to acquire a signature. A signature 
is a combination of the beacon messages received over an interval and the received 

Wireless Sensor Networks  105
signal strength indication (RSSI) for each transmission power level. The mobile 
node acquires a reference signature set at known, fixed locations throughout the 
building. It then sends the signature to the beacon node from which it receives the 
strongest RSSI to estimate its location.
MoteTrack uses a decentralized approach to location tracking. It replicates its 
reference signatures such that a beacon node stores only a subset of all reference 
signatures. A beacon node stores reference signatures and performs computations 
based on the locally stored data. This decentralized approach is prone to failure and 
is further enhanced by the use of an adaptive algorithm to estimate location.
CodeBlue was designed specifically to assist first responders in the event of 
natural disasters. However, the following application, which utilizes sensors and 
robots, has a wider scope and can also be used in accident scenarios, such as moni-
toring a chemical spill.
5.9.2	 WSN and Robots in Disaster Response Applications
In disaster scenarios, it might not always be possible to send humans to certain places, 
for example, because the area is too small or too dangerous. An approach to address 
this problem deploys a combination of small mobile robots and sensor nodes. To 
examine the effectiveness of combining robots and sensors to assist firemen, a group 
of researchers deployed a network of stationary mote sensors, mobile robots equipped 
with cameras, and stationary radio tags to assist firefighters in their tasks (Kumar et 
al. 2004). Communications between robots make use of the 802.11b network.
The robots and sensor nodes, termed agents, may be static, autonomous, or tele-
operated by humans. During a search and rescue operation, first responders and 
tens of agents enter a building, most probably with little, if any, knowledge of the 
building. If floor plans are available, agents make use of them to expedite the search 
process. The agents autonomously organize themselves to communicate effectively, 
integrate information efficiently, and obtain relative position information. Among 
data gathered are temperatures, toxin concentrations, gas leaks, sources of danger, 
and locations of victims. The utilization of robots to assess the level of danger avoids 
unnecessary risk to the life of the rescue team—it is more acceptable to lose a robot 
than a human life. An agent is equipped with a microphone so that a trapped victim 
can call for help. The location of the victim is identified and the task of rescuing the 
victim may commence. If an area is perceived as unsafe, for example, temperature has 
exceeded 100oC, it is marked and firefighters are warned not to go into this area.
In a scenario where an accident involves a lorry carrying hazardous material, a 
similar network can be deployed to determine the extent of contamination in the 
area. The robots are used to follow and monitor the spread of the chemical spill.
The network of sensors and robots comprises low-cost radio tags with conventional 
line-of-sight optical sensors that operate in the IR spectrum. Each tag is assigned a 
unique ID. A robot identifies tags in the vicinity by sending a query message. Any 

106  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
robot that receives the query sends a reply. The robot estimates its distance to the oth-
ers based on the time elapsed between sending the query and receiving a reply. The 
sensors store information about the area they cover locally. The information may also 
be sent to a BS for analysis and later used in decision making. Localized information 
about the relative location of agents is used to build a global map of sensory informa-
tion that is used to navigate humans and robots to a target while avoiding dangerous 
areas. This navigation guide application is composed of simple nodes distributed over 
a large geographical area and is used to assist in accomplishing global tasks.
Because the system consists of numerous agents and it must be robust enough to 
cope with the addition and disappearance of agents, each agent is anonymous. Each 
agent must operate asynchronously and makes no assumption of who its neighbors 
are and the location of neighbors.
An important requirement of robot and sensor systems in emergency application 
is that they should be autonomous and require minimal human supervision and con-
figuration to avoid distracting emergency personnel from more important tasks.
5.10	 Summary
Even though sensors initially found widespread use as tools to monitor the environ-
ment, their applications have now penetrated other areas, such as search and res-
cue, smart homes, and sports. Remote monitoring and management are important 
aspects of WSNs not only because it might be impossible to visit isolated locations 
regularly, but also because remote management is often an intrinsic characteristic of 
the application itself: In a smart home application, homeowners may wish to moni-
tor their homes while away on vacation. As people who use a WSN may not always 
be people with the technical background to install complex devices with complex 
interfaces, environmental sensor networks must primarily consist of off-the-shelf 
components that are easy to deploy, maintain, and understand. Sensor nodes must 
also be low-cost, unobtrusive, durable, energy efficient, and maintenance-free.

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is formed when two or more devices form a 
peer-to-peer network with no centralized control. This may be used in meetings. 
A MANET can be used in the field by search and rescue or military personnel. A 
MANET allows the exchange of data between people working in a team. Because 
there is no centralized control, nodes in an ad hoc network cooperate to deliver 
packets to one another. To deliver a packet to a destination node, an originating 
node has to discover a route to the destination using a routing protocol. The infra-
structureless, decentralized nature of MANETs makes an efficient routing protocol 
critical to facilitating communications between nodes.
Routing protocols can be classified into two categories:
	
1.	Reactive protocols: A mobile node initiates route discovery only when it needs 
to deliver a packet to a destination. There are two reactive protocols: ad hoc 
on-demand distance vector (AODV) and dynamic source routing (DSR).
	
2.	Proactive protocols: Nodes continually exchange routing information so that 
it is readily available when a node would like to send packets to another node. 
There are two proactive protocols: optimized link state routing (OLSR) and 
topology broadcast based on reverse path forwarding (TBRPF).
6.1	
AODV
AODV (Perkins and Das 2003) provides a dynamic, self-starting, multihop rout-
ing between mobile nodes to establish and maintain an ad hoc network. Routes are 
only maintained for destinations in active communication. The algorithm provides 
a way for mobile nodes to respond to link breaks and changes in network topology 

110  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
in a timely manner. The algorithm also establishes a route between a source and a 
destination that is loop-free. It is designed to scale for thousands of mobile nodes 
and can handle low, moderate, and relatively high mobility rates with a variety of 
traffic levels.
A destination SN is associated with each route entry in the routing table. The 
SN is generated by the destination and is included with other route information 
sent to requesting nodes. When there is more than one route available to a destina-
tion node, the one with the greatest SN is chosen.
6.1.1	 Message Formats
AODV defines three types of messages, namely route request (RREQ), route reply 
(RREP), and route error (RRER). The messages are sent to port 654 using User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP). The message format of RREQ is shown in Figure 6.1. 
The fields in the message are:
Type: For RREQ, the value is set to 1.
N
N
Flag: The five flag bits are J (join), R (repair), G (gratuitous), D (destination 
N
N
only), and U (unknown). The J and R flags are reserved for multicasts. The 
G flag indicates whether a gratuitous RREP should be unicast to the node 
specified in the destination IP address field. When the D flag is set to 1, it 
indicates that only the destination may respond to the RREQ. When the U 
flag is set to 1, it indicates that the destination SN is unknown.
Reserved: Set to 0 and is ignored on reception.

6.1.2	 Destination SN
The destination SN plays an important role in ensuring that a route is loop-free. It 
is updated each time a node receives new information about the SN from RREP, 
RREQ, or RRER messages related to a destination. Immediately before a node ini-
tiates a route discovery, it increments its own SN to avoid conflicts with previously 
established reverse routes toward the originator of a RREQ. Immediately before 
a destination node returns a RREP, it updates its own SN to the maximum of its 
current SN and the destination SN in the RREQ packet. A node determines that 
information about a destination is not stale by comparing its current stored SN 
with that obtained from an incoming AODV message. If the value of the SN in the 
message is greater than its stored value, the information related to the destination 
is considered stale and discarded.

When a node receives an AODV message from a neighbor, it checks its routing 
table for an entry of the destination. If an entry for that destination does not exist, 
one is created. If an entry exists, it compares the destination SN in the entry and in 
the message. The route is updated if:
The SN in the table entry is lower than the one in the message.
N
N
The SNs are equal, but the hop count plus one is smaller than the existing

hop count in the table.
The SN is unknown.
N
N
The lifetime field in the routing table is determined from the AODV message or 
is initialized to ACTIVE_ROUTE_TIMEOUT. The lifetime of an active route is 
updated each time the route is used. Each time a route is used to forward a data 
packet, each node on the route (including the originator and destination) updates 
this field to the current time plus ACTIVE_ROUTE_TIMEOUT.
6.1.4	 Route Discovery
Referring to Figure 6.4, if node 1 (originator) wants to deliver a data packet to 
node 2 (destination), and it does not know the route to node 2, it initiates a route 
discovery by broadcasting a RREQ. Node 1 may also initiate a route discovery if its 
routing table indicates that the route to node 2 has been marked as invalid.
The destination SN in RREQ is copied from the entry in the routing table. 
If the SN is unknown (e.g., an entry for node 2 does not exist in the routing 
table), the U flag is set to 1. Node 1 increments its originator SN and inserts it 
in the RREQ. The hop count field is set to zero. Before node 1 broadcasts the 
RREQ message, it buffers the RREQ ID and originator IP address for a period of 
PATH_DISCOVERY_TIME. When node 1 receives a RREQ from a neighbor, it 
compares the RREQ ID and originator IP address value in the message to the ones 
in its buffer. If it recognizes it as the RREQ it has generated, it does not process 
nor forward the RREQ.
A route is determined when the RREQ reaches node 2. When node 2 receives 
the RREQ, it returns a RREP to node 1. A reverse route is set up to forward 
a RREP back to the originator. Alternatively, if an intermediate node, let us say 
node 7, has recently communicated with node 2 and it knows how node 2 can be 

114  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
reached, it returns RREP to node 1 and does not forward the RREQ. Node 7 can 
only return a RREP if it has a fresh-enough route—a valid route entry for the des-
tination whose SN is at least equal to that contained in the RREQ. Intermediate 
nodes (e.g., node 3 and node 4) that receive the RREP cache a route back to the 
originator of the request. The RREP is sent by unicast. Node 1 stores the route to 
node 2 in its routing table. A route to a destination is said to be an active route if 
the route to the destination is marked as valid. Only active routes can be used to 
forward data packets.
If node 1 does not receive a RREP after NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME milli­
seconds, it may broadcast another RREQ. The maximum number of retries is 
determined by RREQ_RETRIES and the number of RREQs generated by node 
1 should not exceed RREQ_RATELIMIT per second. The value of RREQ ID is 
increased for each RREQ generated. If after RREQ_RETRIES, node 1 still does 
not receive a RREP, data packets destined for node 2 are dropped and a destination 
unreachable message is delivered to the application. To reduce congestion, node 1 
must execute a binary exponential backoff before attempting to broadcast another 
RREQ for node 2.
When a node receives a RREQ, it checks if it has received a RREQ with the 
same originator IP address and RREQ ID within the last PATH_DISCOVERY_
TIME. If it has, the RREQ is discarded. Otherwise, it searches for a reverse route 
to the originator. If an entry for the originator does not exist in its routing table, 
one is created. Otherwise, the entry is updated using the originator SN from the

RREQ. The reverse route is needed if the node receives a RREP back to the node. 
The following four steps are taken when creating or updating the reverse route:
	
1.	If the originator SN in the RREQ is greater than the one in the table entry, 
it is copied into the entry.
	
2.	The valid SN field is set to true.
	
3.	The next hop is set to the node from which the RREQ is received.
	
4.	The HOP COUNT in RREQ is copied into the entry.
If the node does not know the route to the destination (therefore, it cannot 
generate a RREP) and the time-to-live (TTL) value is greater than 1, it updates the 
RREQ by increasing the hop count by one and decreasing the TTL by one. Then 
it broadcasts the RREQ on all of its configured interfaces.
A node generates a RREP if either it is the destination or it is an intermediate 
node with an active route to the destination. When a node generates a RREP, it dis-
cards the RREQ. If an intermediate node generates a RREP, the destination might 
not receive a RREQ, and therefore, is unable to learn the route to the originator. To 
ensure that the destination learns the route to the originator, the originator should 
set the G flag in the RREQ. This requires the intermediate node that generates the 
RREP to unicast a gratuitous RREP to the destination, thus creating a bidirectional 
communication between the originator and the destination.
The node generating the RREP copies the destination IP address and the origi-
nator SN from the RREQ into the corresponding field in RREP. If the destination 
generates the RREP, it increments its SN by one if the SN in the RREQ is equal to 
that incremented value. The SN is copied into the destination SN field in the RREP 
and the hop count field is set to 0. It then copies its MY_ROUTE_TIMEOUT 
value into the lifetime field. If an intermediate node generates the RREP, it copies 
its known SN for the destination into the destination SN in RREP.
When a node receives a RREP message, it searches for a route to the previous 
hop. Then it increases the hop count in RREP by one. The forward route for the 
destination is created if one does not already exist. The node compares the destina-
tion SN in the message with one in its routing table entry. The entry is updated if 
the SN is marked as invalid. It is also updated if:
The destination SN in the RREP is greater than the one in the entry and the 
N
N
known value is valid.
The SNs are the same, but the route is marked as inactive.
N
N
The SNs are the same and the new hop count is smaller than the one in the 
N
N
entry.
If the entry is created or updated, the following six steps are taken:
	
1.	The route is marked as active.
	
2.	The destination SN is marked as valid.

116  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
	
3.	The next hop is assigned to be the node from which the RREP is received.
	
4.	The hop count is set to the value of the new hop count.
	
5.	The expiry time is set to the current time plus the value of lifetime in RREP.
	
6.	The destination SN is set to the value of the destination SN in RREP.
The node can now use this route to forward data packets to the destination.
6.1.5	 Maintenance of Active Routes
Nodes monitor the link status of next hops in active routes. If a node detects that 
a link in an active route is broken, it sends a RRER message to other nodes to 
notify them that the link is lost. The RRER message indicates destinations that 
are no longer reachable due to the broken link. To facilitate this reporting mecha-
nism, each node maintains a precursor list that contains the addresses of neighbors 
that are likely to use it as a next hop toward a destination. When a destination is 
unreachable, the corresponding entry in the routing table is marked invalid.
6.2	
DSR
DSR (Johnson et al. 2004) is a reactive routing protocol that is designed specifi-
cally for use in multihop wireless ad hoc networks of up to 200 nodes. It is designed 
for very high rate mobility. It incurs very low overhead but reacts very quickly to 
changes in the network. DSR allows an ad hoc network to be self-organizing and 
self-configuring without relying on an existing network infrastructure or admin-
istration. Mobile nodes cooperate to forward packets to each other to allow com-
munications over multiple hops between nodes that are not within transmission 
range of each other. The routing information is automatically updated as nodes 
move about, join, or leave the network. DSR is composed of two mechanisms that 
operate on demand:
	
1.	Routing discovery: A mechanism that allows a node S that wishes to send a 
packet to a destination D to obtain a source route to D. Route discovery is 
invoked only when S attempts to send a packet to D and it does not know the 
route to D.
	
2.	Route maintenance: While node S is using a source route to node D, S is able 
to detect if the network topology has changed such that it can no longer use 
its route to D using route maintenance. If route maintenance indicates that 
the source route is broken, S can attempt to use an alternative route to D, or 
it can invoke route discovery to find a new route to D. Route maintenance is 
only used when S is sending packets to D.
DSR incurs low overhead because it does not require periodic exchange of pack-
ets to maintain routing information. If nodes remain relatively stationary, the over-

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks  117
head packets drops to zero. As the rate of movement increases, the routing overhead 
scales to only what is needed to track the routes currently in use. The protocol does 
not react to network topology changes that do not affect currently used routes.
The protocol assumes that each node in the ad hoc network is willing to for-
ward packets to other nodes in the network. The diameter of an ad hoc network is 
defined as the minimum number of hops necessary for a packet to reach any node 
located at one extreme edge of the network to another node located at the opposite 
extreme. The diameter is assumed to be small (between 5–10 hops).
6.2.1	 Route Discovery
DSR uses explicit source routing where the packet header contains the complete, 
ordered list of nodes through which the packets will pass to reach its destination. 
This approach allows a source node to select and control the routes for its packets, 
supports the use of multiple routes to a destination, and guarantees that routes are 
loop-free. This approach also allows other nodes forwarding or overhearing the 
packet to cache the routing information for future use.
The sender obtains a suitable route to the destination by searching its route 
cache of routes previously learned. If none is found, it initiates a Route Discov-
ery protocol to find a new route to the destination. The node that initiates the 
Route Discovery protocol is called the initiator and the destination node is the 
target.
Suppose node A is trying to discover a route to node E. To initiate route discov-
ery, A broadcasts a RRREQ that is received by all nodes within the transmission 
range of A. Each RREQ contains information about the initiator and the target 
and a unique request ID (ID=2 in Figure 6.5). Each RREQ contains a record list-
ing the address of each intermediate node to which the request is forwarded. Ini-
tially, the route record contains only node A (the initiator). Figure 6.5 shows the 
content of the route record.
When a node receives a RREQ, it checks if it is the target. If it is not the target, 
it checks:
If it has recently received a RREQ with the same ID and target from A.

118  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
If either is true, the node discards the RREQ. Otherwise, the node appends its own 
address to the route record and forwards the request as a local broadcast packet. The 
node updates its own cache using information in the route record, if necessary.
When node E (the target) receives the RREQ and identifies itself as the target, 
E returns a RREP to the initiator of the route discovery (node A). The reply con-
tains a copy of the accumulated route record from RREQ. When A receives the 
RREP, it caches the route information in its route cache for use to send packets to 
E in the future.
When E returns a RREP, it also examines if its own route cache contains a route 
for A. If one is found, it uses it as the source route to deliver the RREP. Otherwise, 
E has to perform its own route discovery for node A. In this case, the RREP is 
piggy­backed in the packet that contains its RREQ for A. Alternatively, E could 
simply reverse the sequence of hops in the route record that it is copying into the 
RREP and use it as the source route for the RREP.
An intermediate node that is not the target node may return a RREP. Suppose 
node C searches its route cache for a route to the target when it receives the RREQ 
and finds one. C returns a RREP to A and does not forward the RREQ. The source 
route returned in the reply is a concatenation of the route record in the RREQ 
and the source route obtained from C’s route cache. However, C must ensure that 
the concatenated route record returned in the RREP does not contain duplicate 
nodes.
When A initiates the route discovery, it saves a copy of the packet that it could 
not send to E because it does not have routing information in a send buffer. A packet 
in the send buffer is discarded after a predefined period expires to prevent the buffer 
from overflowing. While the packet is in the send buffer, A occasionally initiates 
a new route discovery for the packet’s destination address. To reduce the overhead 
of route discoveries, a node executes an exponential backoff algorithm to limit the 
rate that it initiates a new route discovery for the same target. The timeout between 
successive discoveries is doubled.
A RREQ contains a hop limit that is implemented using the TTL field in 
the IP header of the packet that carries the RREQ. The hop limit is used to limit 
the number of intermediate nodes allowed to forward the RREQ. Each node that 
receives the RREQ decrements the hop limit by one and the packet is discarded 
when the limit reaches 0.
6.2.2	 Route Maintenance
When sending a packet using a source route, each node transmitting the packet 
is responsible for ascertaining that data can flow from that node to the next hop. 
Referring to Figure 6.6, node A originates a packet to node E. Node A is respon-
sible for the link from A to B, node B is responsible for the link from B to C and 
so on. An acknowledgment is returned to confirm that a link is capable of carrying 

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks  119
data. If a built-in acknowledgment mechanism is not available, a node can explic-
itly request the next hop node to return a DSR-specific software acknowledgment.
After receiving an acknowledgment, a node may choose to not require acknowl-
edgments from that neighbor for a brief period. In case a software acknowledgment 
is requested, the request should be retransmitted up to a maximum number of 
times. Retransmissions of the acknowledgment request can be sent as a separate 
packet, piggybacked on a retransmission of the original data packet, or piggy-
backed on any packet with the same next-hop destination. If no acknowledgment 
is received after the request has been transmitted the maximum number of times, 
the sender assumes the link to the next hop node is broken. The node removes this 
link from its route cache and returns a RRER to all nodes that have sent a packet 
via that link since the last acknowledgment was received.
6.3	
OLSR
OLSR (Clausen and Jacquet 2003) is a proactive, decentralized, link-state routing 
protocol. It is a hop-by-hop routing, meaning that each node uses its local infor-
mation to route packets. It is suitable for large and dense mobile networks, and 
networks where the traffic is random and sporadic between a larger set of nodes. 
OLSR is independent from other protocols and makes no assumption about the 
underlying link layer.
OLSR does not require reliable transmission of control messages. Because nodes 
transmit messages periodically, OLSR can sustain a reasonable loss of some mes-
sages. Each control message contains a SN to allow identification in case messages 
have been reordered during transmission. OLSR provides protocol extensions, such 
as sleep mode operation and multicast routing, that allow additions to the protocol 
without affecting backward compatibility.
Each node selects a set of one hop neighboring nodes with bidirectional links to 
act as multipoint relays (MPR). A MPR of node N is denoted MPR(N). MPRs are 
selected such that when N transmits a broadcast message, it is received by all nodes 
two hops away from N. Each node maintains information about the set of neigh-
bors, termed MPR selector set, that have selected it as MPR. A node N informs 
another node that it has been selected as N’s MPR using a periodic HELLO mes-
sage. A node may modify its MPR over time and it indicates it in its HELLO 
messages.
MPRs are used in route calculation to establish a route from a given node to 
any destination. They are responsible for forwarding control traffic to disseminate 
information to the entire network and for announcing the link-state information

periodically to determine the shortest path routes to their MPR selectors. A MPR 
announces that it is able to reach the nodes that selected it as their MPR. MPRs 
provide an efficient mechanism to control flooding by reducing redundant retrans-
missions in the same region. A neighbor of node N that is not its MPR receives 
and processes broadcast messages but does not retransmit the messages it receives 
from N.
6.3.1	 Packet Format
A unified packet format is defined for all OLSR data. This approach facilitates 
extensibility without breaking backward compatibility. It also allows piggybacking 
of different types of information in a single packet. A packet encapsulates one or 
more messages (Figure 6.7).
The packet header contains the following fields:
Packet length: The length of the packet in bytes.
N
N
Packet SN:
N
N
 Incremented each time a new packet is transmitted.
Message type: Indicates the type of message in the MESSAGE part. The valid 
N
N
value is between 0 and 127. The required message types for the core functions 
of OLSR are HELLO-messages (perform link sensing, neighbor detection, 
and MPR signaling), TC messages (topology declaration, i.e., advertisement

presence of multiple interfaces on a node).

TTL: The maximum number of hops a message is transmitted. It is decre-

mented by one before a message is retransmitted. If the value of this field is 0 
or 1, the node that receives the message does not retransmit the message. This 
field allows an originator to limit the flooding radius.
Hop count:
N
N
 The number of hops a message has traveled. It is initially set to 0 
and incremented by one before a message is retransmitted.
Message SN: The originator assigns a unique ID number to each message that 
N
N
is inserted into this field. The SN is increased by one for each message originat-
ing from the node.
OLSR packets are transmitted using UDP. A message can be flooded to the 
entire network or limited to nodes within a few hops from the originator.
6.3.2	 Packet Processing and Message Flooding
Upon receiving a packet, the node examines the message type field to determine if 
the packet should be processed or discarded. Because a node may receive duplicates 
of the same packet, each node maintains a duplicate set that contains information 
about the most recently received packets to avoid reprocessing duplicate packets. If 
the duplicate set indicates the message has been processed, it is not processed again. 
Likewise, if the set shows that the message has been forwarded, it is not retransmit-
ted and is discarded. A message is also discarded if:
The packet contains no messages: that is, the packet length is less than or 
N
N
equal to the size of the packet header.
The TTL is less than or equal to 0.
N
N
If the packet is not discarded, it is forwarded according to the default forward-
ing algorithm.

122  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
6.3.3	 Information Repositories
Through the exchange of OLSR messages, each node accumulates information 
about the network. The information repository at each node contains:
The interface association tuples, (I_iface_addr, I_main_addr, I_time), for 
N
N
each destination in the network.
The logical link information base
N
N
 stores information about links to 
neighbors.
The neighborhood information base
N
N
 stores information about neighbors, 
two-hop neighbors, MPRs, and MPR selectors.
A node maintains a topology information base than contains topology infor-
N
N
mation about the network. The information is acquired from TC messages 
and is used for routing table calculations.
6.3.4	 HELLO Messages
The periodic exchange of HELLO messages is used to populate the local link infor-
mation base and the neighborhood information base. The HELLO message is sent 
as the data portion of the packet format in Figure 6.7 with the message type field 
set to HELLO_MESSAGE. Figure 6.8 shows the format of a HELLO message. 
The fields of a HELLO message are:
Reserved: Set to 0.
N
N
Htime: Specifies the HELLO emission interval used by the node: the time 
N
N
before the transmission of the next HELLO.
Willingness: Specifies the willingness of a node to carry and forward traffic for 
N
N
other nodes. The value of this field is an integer between 0 and 7. A node that 
specifies a willingness of WILL_NEVER (0) must never be selected as MPR 
by any node. A node with willingness WILL_ALWAYS (7) must always be 
selected as MPR. The default value for this field is WILL_DEFAULT (3).
Link code: Specifies information about the link between the sender and the 
N
N
following list of neighbor interfaces. It also specifies information about the 
status of the neighbor.
Link message size: Specifies the size of the link message in bytes and is mea-
N
N
sured from the beginning of the link code field until the next link code field 
(or to the end of the message).
Neighbor Interface Address: Address of an interface of a neighbor node.
N
N
A HELLO message serves three tasks: link sensing, neighbor detection, and 
MPR selection signaling. The three tasks are based on periodic information 
exchange within a node’s neighborhood for the purpose of local topology discovery. 

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks  123
A HELLO message is generated based on the local link set, the neighbor set, and 
the MPR set in the local link information base.
A node performs link sensing on each interface to detect links between the 
interface and neighbor interfaces. A node advertises its entire symmetric one-hop 
neighborhood on each interface to perform neighbor detection. For a given inter-
face, a HELLO message contains a list of links on that interface and a list of the 
entire neighborhood.
A HELLO message is broadcast by a node to its neighbors and is never for-
warded by the recipients. The recipient of the HELLO message processes the mes-
sage for the purposes of:
Link sensing: Concerned with populating the local link information base. 
N
N
For the purpose of link sensing, each neighbor node has a status of either 
symmetric (the link to the neighbor node is bidirectional) or asymmetric 
(communication from the neighbor node is possible but communication to 
the neighbor node is not confirmed). The information acquired by link sens-
ing is accumulated in the link set.
Neighbor detection:
N
N
 Populates the neighborhood information base and is 
concerned with nodes and main addresses. A node maintains a set of neigh-
bor tuples that is updated according to changes in the link set. There is a clear 
association between the link set that maintains information about the links 
and the neighbor set that maintains information about the neighbors. A node 
is a neighbor of another node if and only if there is at least one link between 
the two nodes.

MPR selector set population: Each node in the network selects its own set of 
N
N
MPRs among its symmetric one-hop neighbors. The symmetric links with 
MPRs are advertised with link type MPR_NEIGH in HELLO messages. A 
node calculates its MPR set in such a way that it can reach all symmetric strict 
two-hop neighbors through the neighbors in its MPR set.
When a node receives a HELLO message and finds its address in the list with a 
neighbor type equal to MPR_NEIGH, it records the information from the HELLO 
message in the MPR selector set. It then computes the validity time from the Vtime 
field. The node updates its MPR selector set as follows:
If the originator is not in its MPR selector set, a new tuple is created by add-
N
N
ing the originator’s address.
The validity time is updated as MS_time = current time + validity time.
N
N
6.3.5	 Topology Discovery
The topology information is disseminated through the network via the mecha-
nisms provided by link sensing, neighbor detection, and packet forwarding. These 
mechanisms provide an optimized flooding mechanism through MPRs. Routes are 
constructed through advertised links and links with neighbors. A node dissemi-
nates links between itself and the nodes in its MPR selector set to provide sufficient 
information to enable routing.
The format of a topology control (TC) message that is used for topology dec-
laration is shown in Figure 6.9. This message is sent in the data portion of the 
packet shown in Figure 6.7 with the message type set to TC_MESSAGE. The 
TTL value is set to the maximum value (255) to disseminate the message to the 
entire network.
The fields in a TC message are:
Advertised neighbor SN (ANSN): A SN associated with the advertised neigh-
N
N
bor set. Each time a node detects a change in its advertised neighbor set,

it increments the SN. It is used to keep track of the most recent informa-
tion. When a node receives a TC message, it decides whether the information 
received is more recent than what it already has based on the ANSN.
Reserved: Set to 0.
N
N
Advertised neighbor main address: Contains the main address of a neighbor 
N
N
node. All main addresses of the advertised neighbors of the originator node 
are included in the TC message.
A node sends a TC message to declare a set of links (the advertised link set) 
that contains the links to all nodes in its MPR selector set. The ANSN number is 
incremented when links are removed from or added to the advertised neighbor set 
to build the topology information base, each node that has been selected as a MPR 
broadcasts TC messages that are flooded to all nodes in the network. The informa-
tion disseminated by TC messages is used by other nodes to calculate its routing 
table.
6.3.6	 Routing Table Calculation
Each node maintains a routing table that is used to route data destined for other 
nodes. Information in the routing table is based on the information in the local link 
information base and the topology set. Each entry in the routing table consists of 
R_dest_addr, R_next_addr, R_dist, and R_iface_addr. The entry means that the 
destination node, R_dest_addr, is R_dist hops away from the local node. The next 
hop node is R_next_addr and it is reachable through the local interface with the 
address R_iface_addr. The routing table is updated when:
A new neighbor appears or an existing neighbor is lost.
N
N
A two-hop tuple is created or removed.

N
A topology tuple is created or removed.
N
N
Multiple interface association information changes.
N

A routing table update does not generate any messages for transmission. A node 
runs a shortest path algorithm to construct its routing table.
6.4	
TBRPF
TBRPF (Ogier et al. 2004) is a proactive, link-state routing protocol that provides 
hop-by-hop routing along the shortest paths. Each node computes a source tree 
using a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm. It uses a combination of periodic and dif-
ferential updates to keep neighbors informed of the reported part of its source tree. 
TBRPF consists of two modules: TBRPF neighbor discovery (TND) module and 

126  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
a routing module. TND is independent of the routing module. Because TBRPF 
does not require reliable nor sequenced message delivery, no acknowledgment is 
needed.
6.4.1	 TBRPF Packets
A TBRPF packet consists of a header, optional header extensions, and a body 
that includes one or more messages and padding, if needed. A packet header (Fig-
ure 6.10) is of variable length with a minimum length of one octet. The fields in a 
header are:
Version: Version number.

The TBPRF packet body (Figure 6.11) comprises a concatenation of one or 
more TBRPF messages and padding options. The fields are:
Options: The value depends on type.
N
N
Type: Identifies the message type or padding option.
N
N
Value: Is of variable length.
N
N
There are two types of padding options (Figure 6.12) that may be inserted 
when necessary to align multioctet words within the TBRPF packet (modulo-8/4/2 
addresses for 64/32/16-bit words, respectively). Pad1 inserts one octet of padding 
in the packet body and omits the value field. If more than one octet of padding is 
required, the PadN option is used. PadN inserts two or more octets of padding into 
the packet body. The first octet of the value field has a value between 0 and 253 that 
specifies the number of zero-value octets that immediately follow. The maximum 
length of padding is 255 octets.
The HELLO message (Figure 6.13) contains the following fields:

N
 The number of neighbor interface addresses in the message.
A HELLO message has three subtypes: NEIGHBOR REQUEST (type = 2), 
NEIGHBOR REPLY (type = 3), and NEIGHBOR LOST (type = 4). HELLO is a 
concatenation of the three subtypes. The last two are omitted if the list of addresses 
is empty, but a HELLO message always consists a NEIGHBOR REQUEST, even 
if the list is empty.
A node sends a HELLO at least once per HELLO_INTERVAL (refer to 
Table 6.1). A node may send more than one HELLO during that interval, but the 
time between two HELLOs must be at least NBR_TIME/128 seconds. To avoid 
collisions of HELLO messages, the message is not transmitted at equal intervals. 
Instead, a node chooses an interval of (HELLO_INTERVAL—jitter) between con-
secutive HELLOs, where jitter is selected randomly between 0 and MAX_JITTER. 
The content of a HELLO from node I to node J is determined by the following three 
steps:
	
1.	If nbr_status(I, J) is LOST and nbr_count(I, J) > 0, include J in NEIGHBOR 
LOST and decrement nbr_count(I, J).;
	
2.	If nbr_status(I, J) is 1-WAY and nbr_count(I, J) > 0, include J in NEIGHBOR 
REQUEST and decrement nbr_count(I, J).
	
3.	If nbr_status(I, J) is 2-WAY and nbr_count(I, J) > 0, include J in NEIGHBOR 
REPLY and decrement nbr_count(I, J).
When node I receives a HELLO on interface I from interface J of node J, it 
checks if an entry for J exists in its neighbor table. If an entry does not exist, one is 
created. Then the variables for the entry are updated accordingly.

6.4.2	 Neighbor Table
A node maintains a neighbor table for each interface. Table 6.2 lists variables main-
tained in a neighbor table. Assume that node i has an interface I, node j has an 
interface J, and (I, J) denotes a link between interface I and interface J.
6.4.3	 TND
TND allows node i to detect a neighbor node j such that a bidirectional link (I, 
J) exists between interface I of node i and interface J of node j. It also detects 
when a bidirectional link breaks or becomes unidirectional. It uses differential 
HELLO messages that report only changes in the status of links, resulting in 
smaller sized HELLO messages compared to HELLO messages in OSPF. Conse-
quently, HELLO messages can be sent more frequently to allow faster detection 
of topology change.
TND only senses neighbors that are one hop away. As with OSPF, nodes with 
multiple interfaces run TND on each interface, and a neighbor table is maintained 
for each interface. Because TND is designed to be modular and independent of 
the routing module, it can be used by other routing protocols. Likewise, TBRPF 
can use a different neighbor discovery protocol instead of TND.

Let us assume that node i has an interface I and node j has an interface J, and 
that (I, J) is a link between i and j. Node i maintains a neighbor table for each 
interface I to store information about each neighbor interface J heard on interface 
I. The status of a link is either 1-WAY, 2-WAY, or LOST.
A HELLO message is sent by a node to discover neighboring nodes. It contains 
a HSEQ that is incremented with each transmitted HELLO. A node sends at least 
one HELLO message per HELLO_INTERVAL. A HELLO message from node i 
contains three lists:
	
1.	NEIGHBOR REQUEST contains a list of neighbor interface addresses that 
node i would like to establish a link with.
	
2.	NEIGHBOR REPLY contains the interface addresses of neighbors that have 
listed an interface of node i in its NEIGHBOR REQUEST in their previous 
HELLO messages.
	
3.	NEIGHBOR LOST contains a neighbor interface address J with whom link 
(I, J) is LOST.
Table 6.2  Variables maintained in a neighbor table.
Variable
Description
nbr_rid(I, J)
The router ID of the node associated with 
interface J.
nbr_status(I, J)
The current status of (I, J) which is either LOST, 
1-WAY, or 2-WAY.
nbr_life(I, J)
The amount of time in seconds remaining 
before nbr_status(I, J) is updated to LOST if no 
further HELLO message is received from node j. 
The value is set to NBR_HOLD_TIME each time 
a HELLO is received from node j.
nbr_hseq(I, J)
The value of HSEQ in the last HELLO message 
received by node i from node j. It is used to 
determine the number of missed HELLO 
messages.
nbr_count(I, J)
The remaining number of times a NEIGHBOR 
REQUEST/REPLY/LOST message containing 
node j must be sent on node i.
hello_history(I, J)
A list of SNs of the last HELLO_ACQUIRE_
WINDOW HELLO messages received on node i 
from node j.
nbr_metric(I, J)
An optional measure of the quality of the link (I, 
J). The valid value range is between 1 and 255, 
with smaller values indicating better quality. 
The default value of 1 means that this variable is 
not used.

130  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
It is possible that any of the lists may be empty. Whenever the status of a link 
(I, J) changes, node i includes node j’s interface address in one of the above lists, 
as appropriate, in at most NBR_HOLD_COUNT consecutive HELLO messages 
sent on interface I. This ensures that one of the messages is either received on inter-
face J or node j misses NBR_HOLD_COUNT HELLO messages. In the latter 
case, node j updates the status of link (J, I) to LOST.
To avoid establishing short-lived links, node i must receive at least HELLO_
ACQUIRE_COUNT of the last HELLO_ACQUIRE_WINDOW HELLOs sent 
from interface J before declaring the link (I, J) to be 1-WAY. Then, node i includes 
J in the NEIGHBOR REQUEST list in the next NBR_COUNT HELLO mes-
sages sent on interface I or until a NEIGHBOR REPLY message containing node i 
is received on interface I from interface J. When node j receives the HELLO mes-
sage on interface J, it declares link (J, I) to be 2-WAY. Then it includes node i in the 
NEIGHBOR REPLY list of the next NBR_HOLD_COUNT HELLO messages 
sent on interface J. Upon receiving the HELLO message on interface I, node i 
declares link (I, J) to be 2-WAY.
Node i updates the status of link (I, J) to be LOST if either:
It receives a HELLO message on interface I from interface J with a HSEQ 
N
N
indicating that at least NBR_HOD_COUNT HELLOs were missed.
It receives no HELLO message on interface I from interface J within NBR_
N
N
HOLD_TIME seconds.
Then, it includes node j in the NEIGHBOR LOST list in the next NBR_HOLD_
COUNT HELLO messages sent on interface I. Node J declares link (J, I) as LOST 
when it receives one of the messages or it misses NBR_HOLD_COUNT HELLO 
messages.
6.4.4	 Routing Module
The routing module performs topology discovery and route computation. Each 
node maintains a topology table (TT) that stores information about each known 
node and link in a network. A node is identified by its router ID (RID), where node 
U is a node with RID U. A TT for node i stores information for each node U and 
link (U, V).
Each node maintains a source tree (T) that provides the shortest paths to all 
reachable nodes. A node computes T based on partial topology information stored 
in its TT using a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm. A node reports only a part of its 
source tree, the reported tree (RT), to its neighbors to reduce overhead. The report 
is sent periodically. Periodic updates ensure that neighbors eventually learn of RT 
even if they do not receive all updates. Changes such as addition and deletion are 
reported in a more frequent differential update to ensure fast propagation of the 

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks  131
update to all nodes affected by the change. A node does not forward a topology 
update message it receives.
There are three types of topology update messages: full, add, and delete. A full 
update reports that a set of links belongs to the sender’s RT. An add update reports 
that a set of links has been added to the sender’s RT. A delete update reports that a 
set of links has been deleted from the sender’s RT. An update procedure, which is 
a variant of Dijkstra’s algorithm, is executed periodically to update the source tree 
T and the topology graph (TG). The routing table is updated whenever there is a 
change to the source tree.
Each node generates and transmits a set of full topology update messages on all 
interfaces every PER_UPDATE_INTERVAL seconds. This is the periodic update. 
A differential update occurs every DIFF_UPDATE_INTERVAL seconds if it is 
not time to generate a periodic update but RT has changed since the last time a 
topology update was generated. In this case, a set of topology update messages that 
describes changes to the RT is generated and transmitted on all interfaces.
Each node checks for outdated topology information periodically based on the 
expiration timers. Expired entries are removed from the TG.
6.5	
Summary
How well do the routing protocols work in a real-life implementation? Although there 
are several studies that have simulated the protocols to test their efficiency, currently 
there are very few real-life implementations of any of the protocols. Consequently, 
their efficiency and effectiveness is yet to be ascertained. Chin et al. (2002) attempt to 
address this concern by building a five-hop, four-node testbed deploying AODV. One 
of the problems they identified is the reliability of a route. Because AODV uses hop 
count to establish a route from a source to a destination, it does not take into consid-
eration link stability. The transient radio links resulted in poor operation of AODV. 
To overcome this problem, they introduced a neighbor selection mechanism based 
on signal strength called powerwave. This mechanism is capable of distinguishing 
between stable and transient links, resulting in a route that is more stable.
There are a number of enhancements that have been proposed by other studies 
to enhance the operations of the routing protocols discussed above but are not dis-
cussed in this chapter. The studies are listed in the bibliography if you are interested 
to explore them further.

Chapter 7
Mobile IP
IP is the prevalent standard for communications on the Internet. An Internet 
address is used to route a packet from a source to a destination, possibly via inter-
mediate routers. IP was designed at a time when computers remained at a fixed 
location. An Internet address implicitly specifies a computer’s physical location. 
When delivering a packet to a particular destination, the same route is usually used 
unless an intermediate router falls out of favor due to congestion or other failures 
occur.
The proliferation of laptop and notebook computers coupled with mobility soon 
proved that IP is incapable of supporting seamless mobility. An IP address can no 
longer be used to determine the location of a destination node. Consequently, IP 
has to be extended to incorporate mobility support. The result is the Mobile IP 
specification (Perkins 1997, 1998), which was ratified by the IETF. This chapter 
discusses how Mobile IP supports mobility, how routing is handled, and how it 
addresses security concerns.
7.1	
An Overview
A node may be a host or a router. A mobile node is a node that changes its point 
of attachment from one (sub)network to another without changing its IP address. 
A correspondent node is a mobile or stationary node that is communicating with 
a mobile node. A mobile node is associated to a home network, which has a net-
work prefix matching that of the mobile node’s home address. A home address is 
an IP address that is assigned to a mobile node for an extended period. The home 
address is unchanged regardless of where a mobile node is attached on the Internet. 
A foreign network is any network other than the home network. A home agent is 

134  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
a router on a mobile node’s home network that delivers datagrams to mobile nodes 
in foreign networks. It maintains the current location information of each mobile 
node. A foreign agent is a router in a foreign network visited by the mobile node 
that cooperates with the home agent to complete datagram delivery to the mobile 
node. A mobility agent is either a home agent or a foreign agent. A visited network 
is network other than a mobile node’s home network to which the mobile node is 
currently connected.
A mobility agent announces its existence by broadcasting agent advertisement 
messages. A mobile node that needs to find a mobility agent quickly and does not 
want to wait until the next advertisement message may multicast or broadcast a 
solicitation that is responded to by a mobility agent that receives it. A mobile agent 
determines whether it is on its home network upon receiving the advertisement 
message. If it is, it operates like any other node on its home network.
If the mobile node finds that it is on a foreign network, it obtains a care of 
address (COA) on the foreign network. A COA is the termination point of a tunnel 
toward a mobile node for datagrams forwarded to the mobile node while it is away 
from home. A tunnel is the path followed by an encapsulated datagram. While 
encapsulated, the datagram is routed to a knowledgeable agent that decapsulates 
it and forwards it to its ultimate destination. A mobile node obtains a COA by 
soliciting or listening for agent advertisement or contacting the DHCP or Point-
to-Point Protocol. The mobile node registers its COA with its home agent via its 
foreign agent. Datagrams sent to the mobile node’s home address are intercepted by 
its home agent, tunneled to the COA and received at the tunnel endpoint (either 
the foreign agent or the mobile node) and delivered to the mobile node. Datagrams 
sent by a mobile node from a foreign network are delivered to the destination using 
a standard IP routing mechanism, not necessarily via the home agent.
7.2	
Agent Advertisement Message
A mobility agent broadcasts an advertisement message periodically. The mecha-
nism used by a mobile node to detect a mobility agent is similar to that used to 
detect routers running the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). ICMP was 
extended to support the needs of mobility agents. The extension format is illus-
trated in Figure 7.1. The type field is set to 3 to indicate that it is a mobility agent 
advertisement. The length field indicates the length of the packet and depends 
on how many COAs are advertised. The value of the SN field is incremented by 
one for each successive advertisement. The flags describe special features of the 
advertisement:
R: Registration with this foreign agent is required.
N

B: The foreign agent is busy.

■
■
Bits F and H are not mutually exclusive as a node may act as both a home and a 
foreign agent. Flag B can only be set if node F is also set. A busy foreign agent must 
continue broadcasting the advertisement message (with bit B set) because failure to 
do so would lead to mobile agents concluding that the foreign agent has crashed 
and is moving away unnecessarily. If a mobile node no longer detects advertise-
ments from a foreign agent that previously offered a COA to the mobile node, the 
mobile node assumes that the foreign agent is no longer within range and begins 
searching for a new COA by waiting for an advertisement from another foreign 
agent or by sending a solicitation.
A home agent broadcasts an advertisement message without the COAs. The 
advertisement message broadcast by a home agent allows a mobile node to ascertain 
that it has returned to its home network.

1.	A standard physical network is connected by a router and another node on 
the network acts as a home agent. This is a common configuration for enter-
prises that are starting to deploy Mobile IP.
	
2.	An alternative configuration is a physical network with the enterprise router 
doubling as a home agent.
	
3.	A home network may be a virtual network. The home agent resides on the 
enterprise router and appears to the rest of the Internet as a router from the 
home network.
For the first two configurations, mobile devices can be configured with IP addresses 
of the existing physical network.

Registration Messages
There are two types of registration messages: registration requests and registration 
replies. Both are sent using UDP on port 434. The format of the registration mes-
sages are shown in Figure 7.3. A foreign agent is a passive agent in the registration 
procedure. It passes a registration request to the home agent and later passes the 
registration reply from the home agent to the mobile node.

7.4.1	 Registration Request
A mobile node sends a registration request to inform its home agent of its cur-
rent COA, how long it will be using the COA, and any special features that may 
be available from the foreign agent. The registration request is sent to the foreign 
agent that forwards it to the home agent. After the IP and UDP headers (Fig-
ure 7.3), the registration request has the format shown in Figure 7.4. The lifetime 
field specifies how long the mobile node intends to use the COA. A foreign agent 
may limit the registration lifetime to a configurable value that is indicated in its 
agent advertisements.
The flag bits M, G, and V are similar to the ones in the agent advertisement 
extension explained earlier. Bit B is used to inform the home agent to encapsulate 
broadcast datagrams from the home network for delivery to the mobile agent via its 
COA. Bit D indicates whether the mobile node is collocated with its COA and is 
used to determine how to deliver broadcast and multicast datagrams to the mobile 
node. The ID field is a security feature for replay protection.
When a home agent accepts the request, it associates the home address of the 
mobile node with its COA. This association is maintained until the registration 
lifetime expires. The triplet comprising the mobile node’s home address, COA, 
and registration lifetime is termed as a binding for the mobile node. A registration 
request is considered a binding update.
If a mobile node is unable to contact its home agent, it may register with another 
unknown home agent using automatic home agent discovery. This is accomplished

by using a broadcast IP address instead of the home agent’s IP address as the tar-
get recipient of a registration request. This broadcast is a directed broadcast that 
reaches only the mobile node’s home network. When home agents on the mobile 
node’s home network receive the broadcast, they send a rejection containing their 
address to the mobile node. The mobile node may later use the address in the rejec-
tion notice to send a fresh registration request.
7.4.2	 Registration Reply
The registration reply format is shown in Figure 7.5. The lifetime field indicates 
how long the registration will be honored by the home agent. It may be a shorter 
period than that specified in the lifetime field of the registration request, but never 
longer. If the registration fails, the code field is used to indicate the reason. If the 
value is 0, the registration is successful. A registration request may fail because it is 
denied by the foreign agent or the home agent. Table 7.1 shows possible values for 
the code field. The ID field is used by the foreign agent to match pending registra-
tion requests to registration replies and to relay the replies to the mobile node.
7.4.3	 Secure Registration
An attacker may intercept datagrams meant for a mobile node by supplying a reg-
istration request with a bogus COA. Datagrams meant for the mobile node would 
then be sent to a different destination. To prevent such attacks, the registration 
process must be secure. There has to be a means to convince a home agent that 
a registration request really did come from the mobile node. The method used 
involves inserting a time stamp or a 32-bit random number, termed a nonce, in 
the ID field. This value changes with each new registration to avoid replay attacks. 
The home agent and mobile node have to be synchronized to use the time stamp 
or nonce. In case of an error, the home agent returns a registration reply with code 
value 133 and a resynchronization procedure is initiated.

Mobile IP  139
The standard requires that a mobile node and home agent must share a security 
association and be able to use message digest 5 (MD5) with 128-bit keys to create 
unforgeable digital signatures for registration requests.
Mobile IP defines three authentication extensions: mobile-home authentication 
extension, mobile-foreign authentication extension, and foreign-home authentication 
extension. The mobile-home authentication is required in all registration requests 
and replies. The extensions have similar formats (Figure 7.6) and are distinguished 
by the value of the type field. The security parameter index (SPI) field defines the 
security context to compute and check the authenticator. The SPI selects the authen-
tication algorithm and mode, as well as a secret to compute the authenticator. The 
secret may be a shared key or a public-private key pair. The default authentication 
algorithm is keyed MD5 in prefix and suffix mode to compute a 128-bit message 
digest of the registration message. The default authenticator is a 128-bit message 
digest computed by the default algorithm over the following three byte streams:
	
1.	The shared secret defined by the mobility security association between the 
nodes and by SPI value specified in the authentication extension, followed by 
stream 2.
	
2.	The protected fields from the registration message in the order specified 
above, followed by stream 3.
	
3.	The shared secret again.

The authenticator and the UDP header are not included in the computation of 
the default authenticator value. All implementations of Mobile IP are required to 
implement the default authentication algorithm.
7.5	
Routing and Tunneling
After a successful registration, the home agent starts to intercept datagrams des-
tined for the mobile node and tunnels them to the mobile node’s COA. There are 
a number of encapsulation algorithms, but the default algorithm is the IP-within-
IP encapsulation. Figure 7.7 illustrates how an IP-within-IP encapsulation is per-
formed. An IP datagram is encapsulated by prefixing it with a new IP header (i.e., 
the tunnel header). The new IP header uses the mobile node’s COA as the destina-
tion address. The new header indicates the presence of the encapsulated datagram 
by setting the value of the outer protocol field to 4. The old header is not modified 
except by incrementing the TTL value by 1.
Minimal encapsulation may be used if all parties involved—the mobile node, 
foreign agent, and home agent—agree to do so. Minimal encapsulation uses 
fewer bytes per datagram. The format of the encapsulated datagram is similar to 
IP-within-IP encapsulation. Figure 7.8 shows the minimal encapsulation format. 
Minimal encapsulation is indicated by setting the value of the protocol number in 
the encapsulating header to 55. The header length is either 8 or 12 bytes depending 
on whether the original source address is present. The S bit is set to 1 if the original 
source address field is present; otherwise, it is set to 0. The header checksum is a 
16-bit 1’s complement of the 1’s complement sum of all 16-bit words in the minimal 
forwarding header. The original destination address is copied from the destination 
address field of the original IP header.
7.5.1	 Soft Tunnel State
An ICMP error message returned to a home agent may not contain the IP address 
of the correspondent node that originates the tunneled datagram. Consequently, 
a home agent may not be able to notify the correspondent node that an error has

occurred. To overcome this problem, a home agent keeps track of datagrams tun-
neled to a COA so that if it receives an ICMP error message, it is able to determine 
which datagram causes the error. In turn, this allows the home agent to relay the 
ICMP message to the correspondent node that sent the offending datagram.
For example, let us say a home agent is unable to forward a datagram to a 
COA due to a broken tunnel. Instead of returning a “network unreachable” ICMP 
error to the correspondent node, it returns a “host unreachable” ICMP error. This 
approach makes the tunnel transparent to the correspondent node, as it need not 
know that the mobile node is away from its home network.
In addition to keeping track of datagrams tunneled to a COA, a home agent 
also keeps track of other tunnel parameters (e.g., a path maximum transfer unit, a 
TTL for encapsulated datagrams using a tunnel). The collection of tunnel param-
eters is termed the soft state of the tunnel. Maintenance of the soft state helps in 
relaying ICMP messages.
7.5.2	 Proxy and Gratuitous Address Resolution Protocol
If the home network is configured as a physical network (Figure 7.2), the home 
agent has to act as a proxy Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for mobile nodes. 
Nodes on the home network that communicate with a mobile node are likely to 
have an ARP cache entry of the mobile node. When the mobile node leaves the 
home network, the cached entries become stale. For the nodes to be able to con-
tinue communicating with the mobile node, the home agent broadcasts gratuitous 
ARPs as soon as the mobile node registers a new COA. The gratuitous ARP causes 
the nodes attached to the home network to update their ARP caches so that they 
resolve the IP home address of the mobile node into the link layer address of the 
home agent. Likewise, when the mobile node returns to the home network, it 
broadcasts gratuitous ARPs so that its home address is once again associated to its 
own link layer address.
A mobile node is not allowed to broadcast an ARP request and reply packets to 
avoid creating irreparable stale ARP cache. For example, if a mobile node broad-
casts an ARP request for its foreign agent’s link layer address, stations on the foreign 
network may create an ARP cache entry for that mobile node. When the mobile 
node moves away, the cache entries become stale and there is no way to update it.

7.5.3	 Route Optimization
When away from home, datagrams from a correspondent node to a mobile node 
are encapsulated by the home agent and tunneled to the foreign agent that relays it 
to the mobile node. Datagrams from a mobile node to other nodes can be routed 
directly via the foreign agent (there is no need to deliver it via the home network). 
What happens here is triangle routing (Figure 7.9) and is inefficient, especially 
when the correspondent node is closer to the visited network. This inefficiency is 
addressed using route optimization where a correspondent node has an up-to-date 
mobility binding. Mobility binding associates a home address with a COA for the 
remaining lifetime of that association. This binding information allows a corre-
spondent node to encapsulate datagrams directly to the COA instead of relaying 
them via the home agent.
The home agent is responsible for providing binding updates to appropriate cor-
respondent nodes in foreign networks. Mobility binding involves four steps:
	
1.	A binding warning message (the format is shown in Figure 7.10) is sent to the 
home agent, indicating a correspondent node that is unaware of the mobile 
node’s COA. It informs the recipient that the target node would benefit from 
obtaining a fresh binding for the mobile node.
	
2.	If a correspondent node finds that its binding is stale, or going stale, it may 
send a binding request message (the format is shown in Figure 7.11) to the 
home agent. The 64-bit identification field is used to protect against replay 
attacks and to help match pending requests with subsequent requests.
	
3.	The home agent sends an authenticated binding update message (the format 
is shown in Figure 7.12) containing the mobile node’s current COA to cor-
respondent nodes that need it. This event is triggered when a home agent 
receives a datagram destined for the mobile node from the correspondent 
node that has to be tunneled to the COA. A home agent need not wait for 
a binding warning or a binding request to send a binding update. The bind-

ing update includes a lifetime for the COA association. The correspondent 
node purges the binding after the lifetime expires. The home agent informs 
the correspondent node that it may use minimal encapsulation or GRE to 
tunnel datagrams to the mobile node by setting the M or G flag bit, respec-
tively. The A bit is set if an acknowledgment is required while the I bit is set if 
the ID field is present. A binding update must be accompanied by the route 
optimization authentication optimization that is similar to the mobile-home 
authentication extension.
	
4.	The binding acknowledgment message (the format is shown in Figure 7.13) 
is sent to acknowledge a binding update message. An acknowledgment is 
required for a smooth handoff. Once again, the ID field protects against 
replay attacks and allows an acknowledgment to be matched with a pending 
binding update. If the N bit is set, it serves as a negative acknowledgment to 
inform the home agent that the update is not acceptable.
The messages are sent using UDP. All reserved fields are set to 0 and ignored upon 
reception.
7.5.4	 Handoff Procedure
A handoff occurs when a mobile node moves from one point of attachment to another. 
The transition should be as smooth as possible. When a mobile node leaves a point of 
attachment, it is possible that datagrams tunneled to the previous point of attachment 
would be dropped because it is impossible to instantaneously inform all correspondent 
nodes of the change in the point of attachment. Route optimization addresses this 
problem by allowing a foreign agent to maintain a binding for their former mobile

visitors by maintaining the current COA. Any datagrams destined for the mobile node 
are reencapsulated by the former foreign agent and relayed to the new foreign agent.
Because a smooth handoff aims to handle datagrams without dropping them 
while the mobile node is in transition between points of attachment, it is best not to 
involve the home agent as it is often too far away for a timely response. Figure 7.14 
illustrates the process involved to facilitate a smooth handoff. When a mobile node 
moves to a new point of attachment, it instructs the new foreign agent to send a 
binding update to its previous foreign agent.
If the previous foreign agent does not have a fresh binding for the mobile node, it 
returns the datagrams to the home agent by decapsulating the datagrams and sending 
them using normal IP routing. The problem with this approach is it may give rise to a 
routing loop if the foreign agent loses track of the visiting mobile node. Route optimi-
zation overcomes this problem by defining special tunnels that indicate to the home 
agent that special handling is required. Instead of returning the decapsulated data-
gram using normal IP routing, the foreign agent encapsulates the datagrams using 
the foreign agent’s COA as the source IP address. When the home agent receives the 
datagram, it compares the source IP address with the COA in the binding of the last 
registration. If the addresses match, the home agent understands that it must not tun-
nel the datagram to the COA. Otherwise, the home agent is allowed to retunnel the 
decapsulated datagrams to the current COA from the registration.

Security Issues in Mobile IP
It is imperative that a malicious entity is not allowed to disguise itself as a valid user 
to gain access to network resources. The registration procedure addresses this con-
cern with the use of a registration key. Additionally, when a mobile user roams in a 
foreign network, authentication is required not only to verify the identity of the user 
but may also be required for billing purposes. This concern is addressed by introduc-
ing an accounting, authentication, and authorization services in Mobile IP.
7.6.1	 Security of the Registration Procedure
During a binding update, a mobile node has to convince the previous foreign agent 
that the binding update is not forged by showing the foreign agent that it possesses 
a registration key. The procedure to obtain a registration key is as follows:
The foreign agent uses agent advertisement flags and extensions to indicate

what security features it offers.

146  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
A mobile node determines whether a foreign agent is willing to take part in 
a smooth handoff by inspecting the advertised flags. When a mobile node first 
detects a foreign agent, it is able to determine immediately if the foreign agent 
supports the mobility security association. If it does, the mobile node establishes a 
registration key by picking a good random number and encoding it for the foreign 
agent using their shared secret. For this purpose, the registration must include a 
mobile-foreign authentication extension.
However, because it is unlikely that foreign agents would support this security 
feature, the mobile node has to rely on the home agent to generate a registration key 
for use by the mobile node and the foreign agent. There are three ways to accom-
plish this:
	
1.	If the foreign and home agents share a security association, the foreign agent 
may request that the home agent encrypt a registration key using that security 
association and send it to the foreign agent as part of the registration reply. 
The home agent informs the mobile node of the registration key value using 
the mobility security association that exists between them.
	
2.	If the foreign and home agents do not share a security association, but the 
foreign agent has a public key, it sends the public key to the home agent along 
with the registration and requests that the registration key be encrypted using 
the public key. The encrypted value is returned as part of the registration 
reply.
	
3.	If the foreign agent does not have a security association with the mobile node 
or the home agent, and it does not have a public key, a Diffie–Hellman key 
exchange may be executed.
7.6.2	 Mobile IP and Accounting, 
Authentication, and Authorization
Mobile IP was initially designed to work in WLANs. To support roaming users, 
Mobile IP has been extended to perform accounting, authentication and authoriza-
tion (AAA) services (Perkins 1999, 2000). The combination of Mobile IP and AAA 
provides the mobility infrastructure that meets the needs of cellular telephone for 
mobile data Voice-over IP and a large population of mobile telephone users. For a 
user to be billed for accessing and utilizing resources in a visited network, the iden-
tity of the user must be verified. This is where AAA plays an important role. Before 
we explain the implementation of AAA in Mobile IP, we will give an overview of 
the basic model of implementing AAA on the Internet.
An attendant is an agent in a foreign domain that attends to a client’s request. 
When a client requests access to resources, the attendant requires that the client 
present credentials to authenticate itself before access is granted. To do so, the fol-
lowing have to be in place:

Mobile IP  147
An attendant has to consult a local authority in the same foreign domain to 
N
N
obtain proof that the client’s credentials are acceptable. Because the attendant 
and the local authority are in the same domain, they should have security asso-
ciations that allow them to transact information securely.
The local authority may not have all the information required to verify the 
N
N
client’s credentials, but it is expected that it is configured to negotiate the 
verification of the credentials with an external authority.
The local and external authorities have sufficient security associations and 
■
■
access control to negotiate the authorization to allow the client access the 
requested resources. This authorization depends on secure authentication of 
the client’s credentials.
Figure 7.15 depicts the security relationships between the involved parties. 
Once the local authority obtains the authorization and the attendant is notified, the 
attendant may provide the user with access to the requested resources. Additional 
requirements for an AAA server are that it has to be able to obtain an IP address 
for the client, and it has to be able to identify the client by means other than its IP 
address.
Because there may be many attendants in a domain to handle many clients 
from different home domains, an attendant should run on inexpensive equipment. 
Because an attendant may serve a number of clients at a time, it has to keep the state 
of pending clients’ requests while the local authority contacts the external author-
ity. Attendants should be able to handle any QoS requests that accompany a client’s 
request. Credentials that grant a client access to the requested resources should not 
be usable in future requests with the same or other attendants. To protect atten-
dants from replay attacks, intermediate nodes must not be able to learn any infor-
mation that may enable them to reconstruct the credentials to avoid forgery.
The basic model above is modified slightly (Figure 7.16) to incorporate AAA in 
Mobile IP. The attendant is the foreign agent. The home agent plays a role that is

subordinate to the role played by AAAH (accounting, authentication, and autho-
rization home) during the initial registration. The initial registration with AAA 
takes slightly longer than subsequent registrations. After the initial registration, 
the mobile node is authorized to continue using Mobile IP at the foreign domain 
without further involvement of the AAA servers. The AAA servers perform the fol-
lowing additional tasks:

eign agent from the data supplied by the mobile node. Hence, the foreign agent acts 
as a translation agent between the registration protocol and AAA. The AAA servers 
have to be able to perform key distribution during the initial registration from any 
administrative domain. The key distribution offers the following functions:
Identifies or establishes a security association between a mobile node and a

provides reliable indication to the foreign agent.
The lifetime of associations distributed by the AAA server should be long 
enough to avoid frequent initiation of AAA key distribution to avoid long delays 
between registrations. Long delays may result in dropped packets and noticeable 
service disruption.
7.7	
Mobile IP and Ad Hoc Networks
The importance of ad hoc networks was discussed in Chapter 6. The characteristics 
of an ad hoc network were not considered during the initial design stage of Mobile 
IP. Therefore, a few modifications were made for Mobile IP to support ad hoc net-
working (Perkins 1996). The initial Mobile IP specification assumed that a mobile 
node has a direct link to a foreign agent. For a mobile node to use Mobile IP, it has 
to register with its home agent and obtain a COA from a foreign agent. In an ad hoc 
network, it is possible for a mobile node to stray away from the range of a foreign 
agent. Mobile IP has been extended to allow a mobile node to obtain a COA even 
if it is more than one hop away from a foreign agent. Conversely, foreign agents are 
modified to use an ad hoc route to a mobile node instead of forwarding packets on 
a directly connected link.
Another modification is the addition of a callback feature in the Mobile IP 
daemon. The callback feature allows applications running on the mobile node to 
request that they be informed when a mobile node’s point of attachment changes. 
This is an important feature because when the point of attachment changes, 

150  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
environmental factors that affect the applications may also change: for example, 
available bandwidth and the cost of transmitting packets. Each time the point of 
attachment changes, the daemon sends a callback notification, which includes the 
new COA, to the applications.
When a mobile node roams in a foreign network, it is unaware of what resources 
are available. For example, how does a mobile node know if a printer is available to 
send a file for printing? To determine if a printer (or any other resource) is within 
the vicinity, the mobile node needs the assistance of a Resource Discovery Protocol 
(RDP). RDP allows a service (e.g., a printer, fax, file server) to register with a local 
directory agent. User agents that reside on a mobile node may contact the directory 
agent to obtain the URL that points to the required service. In addition to a URL, 
the directory agent also stores relevant information about a resource such as a color 
laser jet printer. Clients of RDP can name the service and specify the details about 
the service they require to locate a printer.
A nomadic-aware application that performs resource discovery posts a callback 
request to the Mobile IP daemon. When a mobile node moves, the application is 
notified of the move and is informed of the new COA. This ensures that the appli-
cation is aware of the fact that the printer it used previously is no longer available 
and that if it needs a printer, it has to contact a directory agent to obtain informa-
tion about a printer in its new domain.
7.8	
Summary
Mobile IP was designed with the objective of supporting mobility. Much work has 
been done to provide efficient communication and routing to support mobile users. 
Security is one of the critical issues in supporting mobility. Not only do the users 
and the networks have to be protected from malicious entities that may attempt to 
intercept communications, it is also imperative that a user’s privacy is protected. 
A user’s location and movement information should not be made available to any 
third party as this information may be manipulated for illegal purposes, such as 
stalking.
Mobile IP has also been enhanced to support ad hoc networks. This enhance-
ment provides more flexibility for Mobile IP to support various forms of mobile 
activities. Not only can Mobile IP be used in an infrastructured wireless network, 
but also in an infrastructureless environment. With this feature, Mobile IP may 
serve as another means to support seamless mobility.

Issues in Mobile 
Computing
There are several characteristics of wireless networks and mobile devices that oper-
ate in such environments that give rise to several issues that do not pose a problem 
in a fixed, wired infrastructure. Wireless networks are less reliable, have limited 
bandwidth, and transmissions are more susceptible to errors and easier to intercept. 
Mobile devices are often small and have limited processing capabilities. Mobile 
applications have to take into consideration the constraint of small displays, and 
heavy-duty processing should not be done on mobile devices. Because mobile 
devices operate on batteries, managing energy consumption economically becomes 
imperative to prolong operating time and reduces the frequency of recharge between 
use. Among the constraints that have to be considered are:
Limitations on local resources, such as bandwidth and disk space.
■
■
Adaptive behavior; that is, the ability to adapt to its environment and user 
■
■
demand.
Battery power consumption.
■
■
Heterogeneous environment (e.g., platforms, devices, underlying networks).
■
■
Small display size gives rise to the need for new interface design techniques.
■
■
Disparity in the availability of remote services.
■
■
Unpredictable variation in QoS.
■

This chapter discusses various constraints of mobile computing and com-
munications, how these constraints are addressed, and issues that are still 
outstanding.

154  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
8.1	
Bandwidth
Bandwidth is one of the most critical resources in wireless networks. Even though 
offered data rates have increased significantly with the introduction of 3G, the data 
rates on wireless networks will always be a few magnitudes lower than what is avail-
able on wired networks. Design of mobile applications must take this discrepancy 
into account.
An issue that must be kept in mind when designing a mobile application is 
intermittent connectivity. Consider this scenario: a user in a train is using a mobile 
banking application to transfer funds. While this transaction is executing, the train 
enters a tunnel and the connection is lost. How does the application handle this lost 
of connectivity? It is unacceptable if the lost of connectivity results in a situation 
where money is deducted from one account, but not deposited in another. Ideally, 
when the application detects the loss of connectivity, it should be able to suspend 
the transaction and resume it when the train leaves the tunnel and it is able to 
reconnect to the server.
Mobile applications must be designed to adapt to fluctuations in available 
bandwidth, as it is an important resource that may have a huge impact on user 
experience and perceived usability of an application. If the connection is frequently 
lost and the user has to repeatedly restart a transaction, this can result in frustra-
tion and the user may regard the application as useless and cease to use it. Adapting 
to available bandwidth is an important aspect of adaptive behavior that must be 
considered when designing mobile applications.
8.2	
Adaptive Behavior
Adaptive behavior arises due to a significant mismatch between supply and demand 
for resources. The mismatch often occurs in low-level system resources such as 
bandwidth, battery power, or memory. It may also relate to interactions such as 
display size or input modality. As a mobile user moves, services and resources may 
become available or disappear. As this happens, the mobile system needs to adapt 
to what is available in its environment.
The mismatch may occur even if the user is static. Available bandwidth varies 
not only because coverage is nonuniform over an area, but also due to the actions 
of neighboring users. For example, as more users move into a cell and compete 
for resources, the perceived QoS may decrease. As this happens, the system has to 
handle the variations in ways that minimize inconvenience to the users and do not 
abruptly interfere with the task the users are trying to accomplish. As an example, 
a few options may be offered to a wireless video conferencing application to adapt 
itself: The system may reduce the fidelity of the video, try to find another higher 
bandwidth connection, or inform the user of the bandwidth constraint and drop 

Issues in Mobile Computing  155
the video. Which action should be taken depends on what task the user is trying 
to accomplish.
In addition to user mobility, there are a few other reasons for a mismatch. The 
availability of computing servers or data-staging servers is location-dependent and 
affects techniques such as remote execution and cyber foraging. In the case of 
mobile code, low-level resources and interactive resources may vary widely between 
the source and destination systems. As time elapses, the resource level may change; 
for example, residual power on a laptop is depleted as the battery drains.
The mismatch cannot be ignored as it will result in an unsatisfactory user expe-
rience. Severe performance degradation may frustrate the user and, in turn, may 
result in increased human error. Adaptation is important not only as users move 
from a resource-rich to a resource-poor environment, but also in the other direc-
tion. For example, a user should not be deprived of speedier file transfer if more 
bandwidth becomes available.
Adaptation decisions require timely knowledge of current resource levels. The 
change in available resources and its detection should occur promptly. If the change 
justifies a modification in the amount of resources consumed by an application, it 
should be executed without delay. For this task to be accomplished efficiently, the 
operating system has to play a role in managing resources, such as bandwidth and 
battery power, in addition to its traditional role in managing resources such as CPU 
cycles and memory. Adaptation is necessary when there is a significant mismatch 
between supply and demand of resources. There are three adaptation strategies:
	
1.	A client guides the application to use less of a scarce resource. This usually 
changes the user-perceived quality (also termed fidelity); for example, reduc-
ing the quality of video.
	
2.	A client requests a guaranteed amount of resources. This involves a reserva-
tion-based mechanism. To be viable, this approach must provide incentives 
for resource providers to offer differential treatment of users.
	
3.	A client suggests that the user take a corrective action. If the user agrees, 
resource supply may be adequate to meet the demand, but there is no 
guarantee.
All three strategies are important and which strategy is chosen depends on the 
smart space environment. Depending on the circumstances, the system may need 
to switch between the different strategies to guarantee a smooth and seamless tran-
sition. The first strategy is desirable because it hides the complexity of monitoring 
the available services and resources, but it is not always achievable. Although the 
second strategy seems preferable because it shields the user from reduced fidelity 
and taking corrective actions, it might not be suitable under all circumstances and 
in all environments. Reserving resources may deprive other users from obtaining 
the QoS that they require. Some form of priority mechanism may be required to 
determine who can reserve resources and which resources can be reserved, resulting 
in increased system complexity. The third strategy needs to be designed in such a 

156  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
way that it does not cause a distraction or becomes an annoyance to the user. For 
this purpose, a nonintrusive API is required.
There has to be a balance between providing a proactive system and transpar-
ency. A proactive system has to be carefully designed to avoid annoying the users, 
thus, defeating the goal of invisibility. As a system adapts to a changing environ-
ment, it has to take into consideration user preferences.
Odyssey (Noble and Satyanarayanan 1999) is a platform for mobile data access 
that supports application-aware adaptation that is targeted at applications that 
access rich, resource-demanding data. It defines two important attributes to sup-
port the adaptability feature in mobile systems, namely agility and fidelity. Agil-
ity is the speed and accuracy with which an application detects and responds to 
changes in resource availability. Data accessed by an application may be stored at 
a few locations, for example, file servers, SQL servers, or video libraries. Ideally, 
data presented to a mobile client should be identical to the original copy stored at 
the server, but this may be difficult to achieve due to resource constraints. Agility 
is a complex attribute because different applications may have different sensitivity 
to different resources. For example, a mobile conferencing system is sensitive to 
bandwidth fluctuation. It is more concerned with providing an acceptable QoS as 
bandwidth fluctuates. On the other hand, an application that involves intensive 
computation is more concerned with power drain as the CPU consumes a signifi-
cant amount of power. In this case, the concern is to offload computation to a fixed 
network. These two applications require different mechanisms to detect different 
types of changes; therefore, different factors need to be considered in providing an 
agile application.
Fidelity is the degree to which data presented to a mobile client matches the 
reference copy at the server. A reference copy is the most complete, current, and 
detailed version of a data item. There are a number of factors that determine fidelity, 
depending on the type of data and the applications using it. For example, file sys-
tems such as Coda may deliver stale data to an application when network connec-
tivity is poor or unavailable. On the other hand, a topography map has a dimension 
of minimum feature size and resolution. When bandwidth is scarce, an application 
may choose to download a map with a lower resolution to reduce the demand on 
limited bandwidth.
These examples illustrate the dissimilarity between different data types. To sup-
port adaptability for efficient resource usage, some form of awareness has to be 
incorporated into the system. For instance, a video data packet received in error 
can be dropped instead of retransmitted, but a database update must be received 
accurately and retransmitted if an error is detected. Odyssey’s approach to support 
adaptability trades off data quality for resource consumption. Hence, when band-
width drops, a client playing a full-color video may switch to a black-and-white 
video. When implementing the strategies to support adaptability, we have to keep 
in mind how fidelity for a broad range of applications can be lowered without caus-
ing too much inconvenience to the users.

Issues in Mobile Computing  157
The responsibility of adaptation can be made to be the sole responsibility of 
an application without the involvement of the operating system. This approach is 
termed laissez-faire adaptation, which is where each application adapts according 
to its own goals, disregarding the needs of other applications. Consequently, each 
application adapts to the same set of environmental changes and competes for the 
same scarce resources. As applications are more likely to interfere with one another, 
laissez-faire adaptation cannot support concurrency. Due to this drawback, Odys-
sey takes an approach where the operating system is responsible for monitoring 
resource availability, notifying applications of any changes, and enforcing resource 
allocation decisions. In addition to providing overall efficiency, this approach also 
supports concurrency. An approach that makes the system responsible for adapta-
tion is termed application-transparent adaptation. Among resources monitored are 
bandwidth, latency, disk space, computing power, remaining battery power, and 
cost (in cases where the service used charges a fee).
The Odyssey architecture is comprised of:
A warden:
■
■
 A set of type-aware code components. There is one warden for each 
type. It takes advantage of type knowledge to optimize resource usage and con-
sistency. It provides fidelity options for applications to choose. The figure shows 
wardens for video and Web data types. Each warden may perform different 
operations to change data fidelity as appropriate.
An interceptor: Provides a client that forwards file system requests on Odys-
■
■
sey objects to the viceroy.
A viceroy:
■
■
 Responsible for all type-independent functionality on the client. It 
stores information regarding resource usage of all applications and monitors 
the availability of resources and manages their usage. It acts as a filter by noti-
fying an application of a change in resource availability only if the change 
affects the application.
There are two system calls, a resource request and a type-specific operation, that 
perform adaptation functions. A resource request informs Odyssey of changes in 
resource availability; for example, the amount bandwidth has dropped and that the 
video player application needs to adapt to the change accordingly. Only relevant 
changes in available resources are relayed to an application, and only if the change 
has a significant impact on QoS. If the amount of change in the level of resources 
is small and does not have an adverse impact on the application, the informa-
tion is not relayed. An application’s tolerance toward changes in available resources 
is defined by a range termed window of tolerance. Once an application has cho-
sen a fidelity level, it informs the system of its window of tolerance by issuing a 
resource request. The resource request is forwarded to the viceroy, which records it. 
If an estimate of resource availability is outside the range defined by the window, 
an upcall (type-specific operation) is issued to notify applications affected by the 

158  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
change; for example, the video player reduces its frame rate when bandwidth drops 
below a certain value. The application responds to the notification by changing the 
data fidelity. The task of changing the fidelity is carried out by the warden.
Adaptability is especially important to support a ubiquitous computing envi-
ronment. Weiser’s (1991) original vision for ubiquitous computing, now often 
referred to as pervasive computing, is that computers should disappear into the 
background. One day, computers will “weave themselves into the fabric of everyday 
life” until they are indistinguishable from it. The computing and communication 
capabilities are gracefully integrated with users’ environments so that the technol-
ogy “disappears.” It is a technology that supports mobility so that users would not 
detect its absence as they move. For computers to disappear and be unobtrusive, 
computers need to have the ability to sense a user’s context and environment. Thus, 
adaptability is critical to support pervasive computing. In addition to the issues that 
have been discussed, pervasive computing extends the problem domain as follows:
Effective use of smart space: A space may be an indoor space (e.g., a meeting 
■
■
room) or a well-defined open area (e.g., a tennis court). Embedding comput-
ing infrastructure in a building infrastructure enables the bringing together 
of two worlds that were previously disjointed and allows one world to con-
trol another. For example, the air-conditioning and lighting in your office is 
turned on according to your preference when the sensor detects that you are 
heading toward your office from the parking lot.
Invisibility: Weiser’s idealistic vision is to have the technology disappear 
■
■
completely from a user’s consciousness. A more reasonable approximation 
is to minimize user distraction. The technology should continuously meet 
the user’s expectations without surprises. For example, as available band-
width drops, the video conferencing application offers black-and-white video 
instead of shutting down.
Localized scalability: As the interaction between users and their surround-
■
■
ings increases, it gives rise to bandwidth, energy, and distraction implications. 
This is compounded as the number of users sharing the space increases. Local 
scalability is critical to make efficient use of local resources, such as to reduce 
communication traffic and, hence, better utilize available bandwidth. The 
interaction between you and your office space, for example, has to decrease 
as you move away from it. A good system design should significantly reduce 
interactions between distant entities.
Masking uneven conditioning: The level of smartness of available technol-
■
■
ogy will likely vary in different environments and this will be noticeable to 
users. To reduce the amount of variation to the user, the computing space 
has to compensate for “dumb” environments. For example, a system that is 
incapable of a disconnected operation tries to mask the absence of wireless 
coverage in its environment by displaying a friendly error message.

Issues in Mobile Computing  159
To provide effective proactivity, a pervasive computing system should track a 
user’s intent. Consider a video conferencing application. A conventional applica-
tion for a fixed network assumes that a user has a fixed bandwidth allocated to it 
and makes no attempt to adapt itself. As available bandwidth in a wireless network 
fluctuates, a wireless video conferencing application has to adapt itself. There are 
a number of options: the system may reduce the fidelity of the video, it may try to 
find another higher bandwidth connection, or it may inform the user that the task 
cannot be accommodated and drop the video. Which action should be taken would 
depend on what task the user is trying to accomplish. For the system to be able to 
take the correct action without distracting the user, it has to be able to determine 
user intent, which is a nontrivial task. The following questions must be answered 
to determine user intent:
Can user intent be inferred, or does the user have to explicitly state intent? 
■
■
In the latter case, can it be statically specified (e.g., manual configuration in 
the system setting) or is it obtained through a series of interactions with the 
user?
How is user intent represented internally, and how rich must it be for it to 
■
■
be useful? As user intent may vary depending on the task the user tries to 
accomplish, how is the information updated? How is this information made 
available to different layers of the system?
How do we determine the accuracy of knowledge of user intent? Is incom-
■
■
plete or imprecise knowledge still useful? At what level of uncertainty is it 
better to ignore it when making decisions?
Will obtaining the intent cause inconvenience to the user or affect usability 
■
■
and performance? How does one trade off between the benefit and the over-
head cost of obtaining and maintaining the information?
Addressing these concerns is nontrivial and is a focus of ongoing research.
As technology advances and more services are available, users may require com-
puting power that poses a challenge to providing other mobility requirements, such 
as small, light devices with long battery lifetimes. An approach to address this 
problem is cyber foraging, where the computing power of mobile devices is aug-
mented by using machines on the wired infrastructure (Satyanarayanan 2001). As 
the price of computers continues to drop, it will be possible to provide computing 
servers or data staging servers that are connected to the Internet at public spaces 
such as train stations and libraries. These servers are surrogates, and act as gateways 
to the Internet. When a mobile device enters a new neighborhood, it tries to detect 
the presence of surrogates and negotiates the terms for the use of their services. If 
intensive computation is required, the computation is migrated to the surrogate. 
The surrogate may retrieve data from the Internet and cache it locally while per-
forming the computation. The system may also be configured in such a way that 

160  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
the arrival of the user in a neighborhood is anticipated and data required by the 
user is retrieved in advance. Caching data in advance reduces the delay perceived 
by the user. When the user leaves the neighborhood, any data staged or cached on 
his behalf is discarded.
A number of issues need to be addressed to support cyber foraging:
How does one detect the presence of surrogates? There are a few available 
■
■
technologies, such as service discovery in Bluetooth, and one that is most 
suitable for an application should be selected.
How does one establish an appropriate level of trust with surrogates? Because 
■
■
surrogates are placed in public spaces, it might be relatively easy for malicious 
parties to tamper with them to retrieve data about the user or the data that 
has been retrieved or processed for the user.
How does the system decide which computation to offload to a surrogate? 
■
■
There are numerous load-balancing algorithms and one that is appropriate for 
an application has to be chosen.
How much advance notice does a surrogate need to act as an effective staging 
■
■
server with minimal delay?
How is scalability addressed to avoid overload during peak periods?
■
■
What support is needed to make the use of surrogates seamless and poses 
■
■
minimal intrusion to the user?
Once again, the issues that have to be addressed are nontrivial. At the moment, 
available solutions are simplistic and might not scale in a complex environment. 
Much work and research have to be carried out to support adaptability efficiently 
and effectively.
8.3	
Power Management
Because mobile devices operate on battery power, it is imperative that the bat-
tery lifetime be extended for as long as possible. Flinn and Satyanarayanan (2000) 
observed that as more sophisticated applications and services are made available 
to users, there is an increasing pressure for devices with more powerful processors. 
Sophisticated capabilities place severe restrictions on battery capacity. At the same 
time, there is the pressure of making mobile devices smaller, lighter, and more com-
pact. These two contradicting requirements are very hard to reconcile.
Power conservation strategies can be divided into two approaches: hardware 
and software. The hardware approach to reduce power consumption involves pow-
ering down power-hungry components such as the hard disk, the display, and the 
CPU. The software approach involves offloading heavy-duty computing to a fixed 
host and designing software that is able to adapt its power consumption.

Issues in Mobile Computing  161
8.3.1	 Power Conservation Strategies
There are three components that consume a significant amount of power: CPU, 
hard disk, and display. The CPU consumes 16–35% of total power. The hard disk 
consumes 8–22% of total power. The display accounts for 44–60% of total system 
power. Powering down one of these components can reduce power consumption 
between 11–60%.
Power conservation strategies for hard disks involve techniques for spinning 
down the disk during an idle period. The concerns that have to be addressed when 
spinning down the hard disk are:
Establishing an appropriate threshold for the idle period so that the disk can 
■
■
be spun down safely.
Keeping access latency to a minimum because once a disk is spun down, a delay 
■
■
is introduced when spinning up the disk, thus delaying access to data.
Spinning down the disk to reduce power consumption should not adversely 
■
■
affect the disk life span.
Spinning down the disk should not result in higher power consumption com-
■
■
pared to when it is not spun down.
An adaptive disk spin-down policy (Douglis, Krishnan, and Bershad 1995) bal-
ances between reducing power consumption and reducing access latency. The algo-
rithms distinguish between undesirable and acceptable spin-up delays. Undesirable 
delays are referred to as bumps and the timeout value was varied based on users’ 
tolerance of bumps. The adaptive policy aims to reduce the number of bumps with-
out adversely affecting energy consumption compared to a fixed-threshold policy or 
reduce energy consumption without adversely affecting the number of bumps.
Marsh and Zenel (1994) used three different strategies to power down the CPU. 
The strategies, in increasing order of complexity, are:
Halt: A technique for reducing CPU power by executing the halt instruction. 
■
■
Once halted, most of the transistors do not change state, thereby reducing 
power significantly. The halt instruction is simple and consists of only 6–10 
assembly instructions. The CPU still runs at full speed because the clock rate 
is not altered. When halted, no instructions are fetched and nothing happens 
until an interrupt, which may be generated by the RTC or any peripheral 
devices, is sent. Halt reduces total system power consumption by about 22%.
Clock: Relies on hardware and its power management chip. When the idle 
■
■
thread finds no other threads in the ready queue, it reduces the clock speed. 
The ready queue is continually inspected at the lower speed until a new thread 
appears. The clock is then reset to full speed and control is transferred to the 
new thread. The clock speed is also increased if an asynchronous software 

162  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
trap is received. This approach reduces power consumption by an additional 
8–11%.
Clock/Halt: First reduces the clock speed and then calls the halt instruction. 
■
■
Unlike the first approach, some logic may change state when halted. This 
approach reduces the CPU’s power consumption while waiting for an inter-
rupt. The idle thread checks the ready queue and reduces the clock speed and 
calls the halt instruction if there is no ready thread. When an interruption 
is received, the chaining code turns the clock back to full speed. When the 
interruption completes, control returns to the instruction following the halt 
instruction. This technique performs best, reducing power consumption by 
35%.
Because the CPU is one of the most power-hungry components, reducing com-
putation on a mobile device helps to reduce power consumption. One approach 
to reduce power consumption by the CPU is by off-loading computation from a 
mobile device to a host on a fixed network (Othman and Hailes 1998; Rudenko et 
al. 1998). In this strategy, an adaptive load-sharing algorithm is used to select jobs 
for remote execution. Offloading computation to fixed hosts was found to extend 
battery lifetime by 20% (30–60 min). The offloading of computation is transparent 
to the user.
Remote execution is also a strategy adopted by Spectra to reduce energy con-
sumption. Spectra is a component in Aura that is responsible for remote execution 
(Flinn et al. 2001). It monitors resources, such as battery, file cache state, and avail-
able bandwidth, and dynamically balances energy use and performance concerns. It 
is designed to be self-tuning so that applications do not have to specify their intended 
resource usage. When deciding where an execution should be done, Spectra consid-
ers the goal of minimizing application latency while maximizing battery lifetime.
Spectra considers the following factors when deciding where to execute an appli-
cation: performance, energy conservation, and quality. A resource-poor mobile 
device may only be able to provide a low fidelity version of data, whereas a stationary 
machine may be able to deliver a higher fidelity version. It monitors environmental 
conditions and adjusts the relative importance of each goal. For example, if the 
device has just been recharged, providing the best performance is a high priority but 
as energy drains, Spectra trades off lower performance to prolong battery lifetime.
Spectra consists of four resource monitors that predict how much of a resource 
an operation requires for both the local machine and remote servers; for example, it 
predicts the bandwidth required and the delay between the client and each server. 
The prediction is gathered in a resource snapshot that provides a consistent view 
of resource availability for that operation. The resource monitors observe applica-
tion behavior and measure resource usage while an operation is executing. When 
the operation is completed, the observed values (e.g., input parameters, bandwidth 
usage fidelity) are logged and are used to predict future resource usage. The accu-

Issues in Mobile Computing  163
racy of a prediction increases over time as the operation is repeatedly executed. 
There are four resource monitors:
	
1.	CPU monitor: Predicts CPU availability using a smoothed estimate of recent 
CPU load. While an operation is executing, the CPU monitor measures CPU 
cycles consumed on local and remote machines.
	
2.	Network monitor: Predicts available bandwidth and round-trip times of 
remote machines.
	
3.	Battery monitor: Predicts energy levels by querying the amount of charge 
left in a smart battery periodically. A smart battery contains chips that report 
information such as battery level and power drains.
	
4.	Cache state monitor: Because a cache miss results in data access that con-
sumes time and energy, a cache state monitor estimates the cost of fetching 
a file that is not available in the mobile device’s cache. During an execution, 
it monitors file access and upon completion, it logs the name and size of 
each file accessed. The prediction scheme assumes that the likelihood of a 
file access during an operation is similar to the percentage of times it was 
accessed during recent operations of similar type and input parameters. The 
access likelihood is maintained as a weighted average and is adjusted by the 
monitor according to changes in application behavior over time.
Spectra’s decision engine chooses a location and fidelity for each operation. It 
evaluates alternatives by their impact on user metrics that measure the end user’s 
perceived performance or quality. An alternative is evaluated based on a context-
independent value of each metric. Each value is assigned a weight that reflects the 
current desirability of the metric to the user. Finally, Spectra calculates the prod-
uct of the weighted metric to compute a single value for evaluating the alternative. 
It may use many resource predictions to calculate a metric’s context-independent 
value. For example, execution latency is the sum of the predicted latencies of fetch-
ing an uncached item, network transmissions, and processing on local and remote 
machines.
Odyssey uses a predictive approach that is slightly different from Spectra (Flinn 
and Satyanarayanan 2000). One of the important characteristics of mobile soft-
ware is the ability to learn a user’s habits and preferences so that this information 
can be used by the software to anticipate a user’s needs. This ability is important not 
only to deliver just-in-time information but can also be used to conserve power.
Odyssey monitors a user’s habits and preferences and uses that information to 
predict how much power is required to execute the user’s tasks. When there is a 
significant mismatch between predicted demand and available energy, it notifies 
the application to adapt. This approach extends battery lifetime by up to 30%. The 
exponential smoothing function used is:
new = (1 − α)(this sample) + α.old,

164  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
where α is a parameter that determines the relative weights of current and past 
power usage. It is varied as energy drains to trade off between agility and stability. 
As α decreases, the application is biased toward agility.
Future power usage demand is estimated periodically. The estimate is multi-
plied by the time remaining to complete the task to estimate future energy demand. 
If predicted demand exceeds residual energy, Odyssey issues an upcall so that the 
application can adapt to reduce energy consumption. Conversely, if residual energy 
significantly exceeds predicted demand, applications are notified to increase data 
fidelity. When multiple applications run concurrently, Odyssey decides which ones 
to notify based on a user-specified priority scheme.
Odyssey defines a hysteresis in its adaptation strategy. Supply must exceed 
demand by a defined amount to trigger fidelity improvement. The hysteresis value 
consists of two components: a variable (5% of residual energy) and a constant (1% 
of the initial energy available). The variable component is biased toward stability 
when there is ample residual energy and toward agility when it is scarce. The con-
stant component is biased against fidelity improvements when residual energy is 
low. Fidelity improvement is restricted to once every 15 s to avoid excessive adapta-
tion. Odyssey’s adaptation strategy varies for different components.
For video player applications with hardware-only power management, energy 
consumption reduces by 9–10% mainly because the hard disk remains in standby 
mode while the video is fetched and played. A lossy compression is used to reduce 
video fidelity, resulting in 16–17% less energy power consumption than using 
hardware-only power management. Halving the height and width of the display 
window further reduces energy consumption by 19–20% than using hardware-
only power management. When reducing video fidelity and the size of window 
display is combined, energy consumption is reduced by 35%.
The speech recognizer application consists of a front end that generates a wave-
form based on the word uttered by the user. The waveform is submitted to a local 
or remote speech recognition system for processing. A local recognition incurs 
a processing cost but saves on transmission cost, whereas a remote recognition 
incurs energy cost for transmission but can exploit the CPU, memory, and energy 
resources of the remote server. A hybrid operation is also possible where the first 
phase of recognition is performed locally and a compact intermediate represen-
tation is then sent to a remote server for the remaining recognition process. In 
this case, fidelity is lowered by using a reduced vocabulary and a less complex 
acoustic model resulting in reduced memory footprint and processing required for 
recognition. The down side is it degrades the recognition quality. Although hard-
ware-only power management reduces energy consumption by 33–34%, lowering 
fidelity results in a reduction of 25–46%. Remote recognition at reduced fidelity 
results in a saving of 42–65%. A hybrid operation at reduced fidelity results in a 
saving of 53–70%. Combining hardware-only power management with hybrid, 
low-fidelity recognition results in 69–80% less energy consumption. The optimal 

Issues in Mobile Computing  165
strategy to adopt depends on resource availability and the user’s tolerance for low-
fidelity recognition.
An adaptive map viewer named Anvil fetches maps from a remote server and 
displays them to the client. Fidelity is lowered by filtering that eliminates fine detail 
and less important features and cropping that restricts data to a geographic subset 
of the original map. Hardware-only power management reduces energy consump-
tion by 9–19%. When combined with filtering, a reduction of 6–51% is achieved, 
depending on the level of filtering applied. Combining filtering and cropping results 
in an energy reduction of 36–66%.
Zone backlighting is an experimental power management approach where the 
screen is divided into grids; each grid representing a zone. The energy usage of each 
grid is controlled independently. When residual energy exceeds demand, a large 
high-fidelity image spans several zones. As the battery drains, applications gener-
ate smaller, lower-fidelity images that span fewer zones. This approach saves power 
consumption by 7–29%.
The various power conservation techniques discussed above may be combined to 
prolong battery lifetime significantly. Even though power conservation is undeniably 
a critical element of mobile computing, is there an alternative to returning home to 
recharge a flat battery? Yes, there is. The technique is known as energy scavenging.
8.3.2	 Energy Scavenging
Energy scavenging, also known as energy harvesting, is a technique that collects 
energy from its surroundings to power systems and it may involve storing energy 
when it is not required in batteries, capacitors, or springs. The most familiar exam-
ple of energy scavenging is solar cells used to power calculators. Energy scavenging 
is especially useful for applications that require small amounts of continuous power 
or that have short periods of high-power use (Want et al. 2005). Energy may be 
scavenged from a number of sources (Paradiso and Starner 2005):
Background radio signals: Electronic systems may harvest energy from 
■
■
­ambient-radiation sources. A drawback of this approach is it requires either a 
large collection area or close proximity to the radiating source. The amount of 
energy harvested is on the order of tens of microwatts.
Ambient lighting: The energy conversion efficiency of a solar cell module is 
■
■
less than 20%. Utilizing sunlight is not a problem in tropical regions, but the 
lack of strong, consistent sunlight in other regions may pose a constraint. The 
amount of energy harvested from sunlight varies from a few kilowatts for a 
solar home system to up to 2 W for a cell phone that harvests power from 
direct sunlight.
Thermoelectric conversion: This involves harvesting energy from objects 
■
■
or environments at different temperatures via heat transfer. An example of  

166  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
thermoelectric conversion is the Seiko Thermic wristwatch that uses ten thermo­
electric modules to generate energy (a few microwatts) from the small thermal 
gradient provided by body heat over ambient temperature.
Vibrational excitation: Vibrations vary widely in frequency and amplitude. 
■
■
Among the sources of vibration are vibrations on floors and walls caused by 
nearby machinery, from jet engine housings, and automobile chassis. Energy 
is harvested by exploiting the oscillations of a proof mass resonantly tuned to 
the environment’s dominant mechanical frequency. An example of harvest-
ing energy from vibrations is a self-winding wristwatch that contains a rotary 
proof mass mounted off-center on a spindle. As the wearer moves, the mass 
spins and winds the mechanism.
Power from human input: Actions such as cranking, shaking, squeezing, 
■
■
spinning, pushing, pumping, and pulling can be exploited to power up a 
device. A piezoelectric element with a resonantly matched transformer and 
conditioning electronics generate approximately 1 mJ at 3 V per 15-N push 
when struck by a button. The power generated is enough to run a digital 
encoder and a radio that can transmit over 15 m.
Ambulatory power generation:
■
■
 A human body generates about 0.1 to 1.5 kW2 
when it moves from resting to a fast sprint. A person exerts up to 130% of 
their weight across their shoes at heel strike and toe off. Standard jogging 
sneakers compress by up to 1 cm during a normal walk, meaning that for a 
70-kg person, about 7 W of power is available at a 1-Hz stride from heel strike 
alone. Walking produces an average of 250 to 700 mW.
The amount of power that can be scavenged is limited by the amount of avail-
able raw energy and the surface area of net mass of a device. The available power 
is sufficient for devices that require low power as available power is usually around 
milli- or microwatts. Even though currently the amount of power that can be scav-
enged is very little, hopefully ongoing research in this area will offer better results 
in the future.
8.4	
Interface Design
The most visible constraint of mobile devices is the display size. Even though higher 
data rates are now available to support multimedia applications and faster data 
downloads, the amount of data that can be displayed will still be constrained by 
the small display size.
The small size of mobile devices imposes a constraint in I/O method. Some 
mobile devices support extensive graphic capabilities, and others may provide lim-
ited display resolutions. Some are equipped with enhanced I/O devices, such as 
a portable keyboard, and others are constrained by limited input, for example, a 
stylus pen. Mobile phones are not equipped with a keyboard and each button rep-

Issues in Mobile Computing  167
resents three to four characters, making it slower and inconvenient to input text. 
Consequently, UI design not only needs to take these constraints into consider-
ation, it also needs to consider how the mobile devices will be used to ensure that 
appropriate interfaces are provided to support users’ tasks.
There are a number of approaches to make efficient use of limited screen size, 
such as minimizing the use of buttons, menus, and scroll bars, all of which con-
sume a considerable amount of space (Grasso 2004). These objects may be replaced 
with objects that can be used for both navigation and providing context, for exam-
ple, focus-and-context visualization that divides the screen into a set of objects. A 
central object provides details, and other objects provide thumbnail overviews used 
for navigation.
Currently, the methods available for text input are still unsatisfactory. Given 
these restrictions, the following must be considered during the design and develop-
ment of mobile applications:
Input should be restricted to a minimum: Avoid alphanumeric input as far as 
■
■
possible. If it is unavoidable, defer it to the latest possible point in time. Drop 
any functionalities that require a lot of alphanumeric input.
Focus on very important information: Even though there is a significant 
■
■
increase in bandwidth with 3G technology, the amount of useful information 
that can be displayed on a mobile device is still limited. Information should 
be customized to the needs of the user.
Even though text input may be unavoidable in certain applications (e.g., pass-
word input for mobile banking), it may be inappropriate for other types of applica-
tions as illustrated in the case study discussed in Section 8.7.1.
Desktop computers allow a GUI that often relies on rich visual feedback and 
requires a user’s undivided attention—a luxury on mobile devices considering that 
a mobile user is often occupied with multiple tasks (e.g., driving while checking 
traffic or weather report). Consequently, an interface for mobile applications should 
be one that is not distracting and not demanding of users’ attention.
Users may use different platforms to perform a tasks. For example, a user may 
prepare and share a presentation using a desktop computer. On the way to meet a 
client, the user may review the presentation and make a few changes using a pocket 
PC based on comments received from a colleague. The updated presentation is then 
downloaded to a laptop just before the presentation to the clients. This scenario 
illustrates that UIs for mobile applications need to be sensitive to (Eisenstein et al. 
2002):
Platform: Adapts to the characteristics of the device, such as screen surface, 
■
■
color depth, and screen resolution. Interactive dialogs must consider available 
bandwidth and adapt accordingly.

168  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Interaction: Provides a mechanism that remembers previously used interac-
■
■
tion techniques, for example, window size and location.
User: Adapts to user skill level, system and task experience, and preferences.
■
■
In the following sections, two studies are used to illustrate various aspects of 
mobile interface design.
8.4.1	 Context-Aware UI Modeling
The Map ANNotation Assistant (MANNA) is a multimedia application that is 
used by geologists, engineers, and military personnel to create annotated maps of 
geographical areas (Eisenstein et al. 2002). Due to the nature of the application 
and its intended use, the application has to run on several platforms and can be 
utilized over the Internet. Hence, the UIs must be tailored for use on the different 
platforms.
Eisenstein et al (2002) describe the following possible usage scenario. A geolo-
gist has been dispatched to an area that had recently been affected by an earth-
quake. Before leaving, the geologist uses a desktop computer to download maps 
and reports of the area. The geologist also downloads the relevant information to 
a laptop before heading for the site. When the geologist uses the laptop on the 
airplane, commands that rely on a network connection are disabled because the 
laptop is not connected to the Internet. When the geologist examines a video of the 
site, the UI switches to a black-and-white display and reduces the rate of frames per 
second to conserve battery power. At the airport, the geologist receives a message 
from MANNA via mobile phone with alerts to examine a location. The map of the 
region is not displayed due to display limitation, but driving instructions to get to 
the location are sent along with the geologist’s current GPS location. At the site, the 
geologist prepares a report using a palmtop. Because the palmtop relies on a touch 
pen for interaction, the UI avoids double-click and right-click interactions.
There are three model components for designing a UI for mobile computing 
applications:
	
1.	Platform model: Describes the various computer systems that run a UI, 
including constraints placed by the platform on the UI. This model may be 
static or dynamic. A static model allows the UIs to be exploited at design 
time and a set of UIs can be generated for each platform. On the other hand, 
a dynamic model is exploited at run time and is sensitive to changing condi-
tions; for example, it responds to changes in available bandwidth by adapting 
the interface accordingly.
	
2.	Presentation model: Describes the visual appearance of the UIs, such as 
the hierarchy of windows, widgets, stylistic choices, and the placement of 
widgets.

Issues in Mobile Computing  169
	
3.	Task model: Presents a structured representation of tasks that the user may 
perform. It is hierarchically divided into subtasks and may include informa-
tion on goals, pre- and postconditions, and whether a task is optional, may be 
repeated, or enables another subtask.
The adaptation of UIs may occur at design time in the form of automated design 
support or at run time via a dynamic UI. Two techniques are used to design adap-
tive UIs such as the ones given in the scenario above: abstract interaction objects 
(AIOs) and concrete interaction objects (CIOs). In AIO, an interaction object is 
an element that allows users to visualize or manipulate information or perform 
an interactive task. The objects are the atomic building blocks of a UI. An AIO is 
executable on any platform and is implementation-independent and, thus, porta-
ble. AIOs allow the implementation of the same UI on multiple platforms. Unlike 
an AIO, a CIO is an interactor, such as a dialog box or a button, that is executable 
on a platform without additional processing. An AIO is a parent of several CIOs. 
A CIO inherits the property of its parent AIO and is mapped on to the platform it 
supports. A designer need only be concerned with the AIOs as the appropriate CIO 
is rendered automatically depending on the platform.
Mobile devices come in different screen sizes and resolutions. There are three 
parameters that need to be considered when determining the amount of display size 
required by a UI: size of individual interactors, layout of interactors within a win-
dow, and the allocation of interactors among several windows. There are two ways 
to accommodate screen resolution constraints by reducing the size of interactors:
	
1.	Shrink the interactors while observing usability constraint related to the AIO 
type; for example, reduce the length of an edit box to a minimum while the 
height is maintained at least at the smallest legible font size.
	
2.	If the size of an interactor cannot be reduced, the interactor is replaced with 
a smaller alternative; for example, a Boolean check box requires less screen 
space than a pair of radio buttons.
The layout of interactors within a window and the allocation of interactors 
between windows are grouped under a presentation structure. The appropriate pre-
sentation structure is selected based on the constraints of available screen space. 
There are two solutions. The first solution involves creating mappings between each 
platform and an appropriate presentation structure. This approach is simple but the 
drawback is that it is static; for example, if the available screen solution increases 
at run time, the application is unable to take advantage of this change. The second 
solution involves building a mediator agent that dynamically selects the appropriate 
presentation model for each device.
Although it is possible for a designer to specify a set of presentation structures, 
it is better if the correct structure is generated by the system within the constraints 
of AIOs. For this purpose, there are two abstractions:

170  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
	
1.	A logical window (LW) is a grouping of AIO, such as a window area or a 
dialog box. All LWs are constrained by the screen space.
	
2.	A presentation unit (PU) is a complete presentation environment required to 
execute an interactive task. A PU may be decomposed into one or more LWs 
that may be displayed on the screen simultaneously, alternately, or a combi-
nation of the two. Each PU consists of at least one window called the main 
window that enables navigation to other windows.
It is often assumed that the same functionalities should be provided on every 
type of device to support the same set of tasks. However, this is unnecessary as a 
user often performs only a subset of tasks on one type of device. For example, refer-
ring to the scenario given earlier, a desktop is used to obtain a comprehensive map 
of the area, a mobile phone is used to obtain positioning information and driving 
directions, and a palmtop is used to prepare a report on site. Each device is used 
to perform a subset of tasks. Using a task model (Figure 8.1), it is possible for the 
system designer to take advantage of the knowledge about what tasks are performed 
on which device to create mappings between platforms and tasks.

interface modeling. Proceeding of the 3rd IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing 
Systems and Applications. Used with permission.)

Issues in Mobile Computing  171
The presentation model can be optimized to perform a subset of tasks. Tasks 
that have been identified as important should be represented by AIOs that are easily 
accessible. For example, clicking on a map while using a palmtop allows the user 
to enter a note whereas doing the same while using a desktop displays a rich set of 
geographical and meteorological information of the selected region in addition to 
displaying a list of previously entered notes.
8.4.2	 Tactile Interface
An alternative to using keypad and stylus pen as a means of input is to use the sense 
of touch. This can be accomplished by embedding a PDA with a tactile actuator 
named TouchEngine (Poupyrev et al. 2002). Because mobile devices are often kept 
close to the user’s body, the sense of touch provides a means of interaction that is 
nonobtrusive. Tactile interface is a good channel of interaction for mobile devices 
for the following reasons:
It is fast: The sense of touch is five times faster than vision and humans can 
■
■
detect two consecutive tactile stimuli in about 5 ms.
It needs little conscious control: Because large areas of the sensory cortex 
■
■
are devoted to processing stimuli from the skin, complex motor operations 
produce little cognitive load (a large cognitive load demands more attention 
from the user, thus, distracting him from other tasks) and can be performed 
in parallel with other activities.
It allows for information encoding: Touch allows us to ascertain object prop-
■
■
erties more accurately, even where vision fails, for example, texture variation. 
With proper encoding, messages can be transmitted through the skin. Dif-
ferent vibration patterns can be used to convey different messages (e.g., task 
reminder, incoming email).
It produces strong emotional responses: We can often recall how a touch feels 
■
■
(e.g., stroking a child’s hair). Touch has a very strong impact and if aroused 
in unusual patterns can be attention-demanding.
Haptics is a term used to refer to tactile feedback. The development of a haptic 
display involves:
Choosing or developing a haptic actuator, which is a transducer that converts 
■
■
electrical signals into mechanical motion. Electrical motors are often used as 
actuators in haptic research.
Designing a tactile display that converts mechanical motion produced by the 
■
■
actuator into force communicated to the user. The same actuator can produce 
various haptic displays with very different interactive properties.

172  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Developing control hardware and software. Effective operation of a haptic 
■
■
display requires a good understanding of its properties.
There are two arguments for ambient or peripheral awareness displays. First, 
they allow users to perceive and process incoming information with little conscious 
effort and without interrupting current activities. Second, they provide unobtru-
sive notification techniques to grab the user’s attention when the interruption is 
needed.
Touch is the perfect ambient information channel because it is more powerful 
than vision or sound. We already rely heavily on our tactile sense to receive infor-
mation from the background; for instance, we feel the ground with our feet and 
unconsciously adjust how we walk when we step from the pavement to the grassy 
lawn. We may not hear our name called, but we react when tapped on the shoul-
der. Most of these are done with little focused attention. Ambient tactile interfaces 
may be particularly useful in mobile applications because tactile displays that are 
close to the body allow information to be received without interrupting the current 
activity.
Even though mobile devices utilize vibrotactility for notification, the current 
tactile displays convey only one bit of information. For example, when a silent mode 
is activated, a hand phone vibrates to indicate an incoming call, but it does not 
indicate the urgency of the call or who the caller is. Consequently, the user has to 
suspend his current task to interact with the device and determine who the caller is 
and the urgency of the call. An approach to overcome this problem is by utilizing 
intelligent context-aware and ambient notification mechanisms. It has been shown 
that humans can accurately distinguish different vibrotactile patterns. TouchEngine 
provides six tactile pulse sequences with different rhythms, intensities, and gradients 
of vibration.
Consider the task of downloading a file to a desktop computer. You can peri-
odically glance at the progress bar to monitor the download as it progresses and 
determine if the download has been completed. This visual monitoring process is 
easy to do on a desktop computer. However, if you are downloading a file to your 
pocket PC, you might not be able to visually monitor the download progress. It 
would be more convenient if you could initiate the file download and then put away 
the device in your pocket while you carry out other tasks, such as buying a train 
ticket and walking to the platform to wait for the train. An alternative to the visual 
progress bar is a tactile progress bar that vibrates when the download is completed. 
The tactile progress bar provides a short tactile impulse by clicking periodically 
and the intensity of click increases as the download nears completion. Once the 
download is completed, you can decide if you want to retrieve the device to peruse 
the downloaded file or wait until you get a seat in the train to do so. Either way, 
the task of downloading the file does not demand your full attention and does not 
distract you from other tasks you have to perform.

Issues in Mobile Computing  173
Tactile and tilting interfaces may be combined to provide a more effective 
means of interaction. The device with tilting interface is equipped with tilt or pres-
sure sensors, and users interact with them by physically manipulating the device; 
for example, a user tilts a mobile device back and forth to scroll through a page. 
An advantage of the tilting interface is it does not require a two-handed input, 
thus, freeing one hand for other physical tasks. A drawback of the tilting interface 
is users tend to overshoot the target destination; for example, upon reaching the 
intended paragraph in a text, users could not return the device to its neutral state 
in time to stop the scrolling. As a result, users tend to tilt in the opposite direction 
in an attempt to stop the scrolling. Another drawback is it requires constant visual 
attention.
An example of how tilting and tactile interfaces can be combined is in scrolling 
a two-dimensional (2D) map. The map scrolls in the direction of the tilt. Each time 
the image moves on the screen, a simple scratching tactile pattern is played so that 
the user can feel the map shifting within the device. The tactile pattern changes 
when the image reaches its boundary. Another example is the use of a tactile tap 
each time one line of text is scrolled up or down. The speed of the tapping becomes 
slower or faster accordingly as the user changes the scrolling speed. When the device 
is in a neutral position, the interface produces a short buzz so that the user is aware 
that the device is in its neutral position, thus, reducing overshooting when the user 
wants to stop scrolling.
The haptic interface is also useful in clinical applications on handheld comput-
ers (Grasso 2004). A patient’s medical chart can be picked up, carried, held in one 
hand, and annotated with a pen. The same can also be done with a PDA or palm-
top. However, there are certain things that cannot be done with a handheld com-
puter, such as creasing a page to mark it or flipping through pages. When designing 
a mobile application, it is imperative that the application does not impose too much 
change in the way the users have got used to performing their tasks. To achieve 
this, the handheld device is incorporated with a haptic display with the properties 
of a patient’s chart. Instead of turning the pages by scrolling, the physician does 
so by brushing a finger across the top corner of the display—similar to turning a 
page in a book. The handheld device is equipped with tilt and pressure sensors that 
measure the angle of the device and finger pressure along to edge that give a similar 
effect as fanning through a book.

Heterogeneity of Devices and Environments
User devices vary in terms of screen size, color display, effective bandwidth, pro-
cessing power, and the ability to handle specific data encodings. These variations 
make it difficult for mobile application developers to make any assumptions regard-
ing the capability of the devices that use their applications. One approach to handle 
the variations is by using on-demand distillation to increase the QoS to the client 

174  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
and reduces latency. Instead of performing the distillation at the client (device) or 
the server, it is performed in the network infrastructure. Distillation is defined as 
highly lossy, data-type specific compression that preserves most of the semantic 
content of data object while adhering to a particular set of constraints (Fox et al. 
1996). The on-demand distillation considers the following variations:
Network variation: In terms of bandwidth, latency, and error behavior. On-
■
■
demand distillation focuses on reducing bandwidth requirements at the 
application level.
Hardware variation: Such as screen size and resolution, color and grayscale bit 
■
■
depth, memory, and processing power.
Software variation: In terms of application-level data encoding that a device 
■
■
can handle (e.g., JPEG, nonstandard HTML extensions) and protocol exten-
sions such as IP multicast support.
The distillation is data-type specific. Fox et al. (1996) considered the distilla-
tion of video, image, or text. Lossy image compression involves discarding color 
information, high-frequency components, or pixel resolution. In addition, lossy 
video compression includes frame rate reduction. Lossy text compression involves 
discarding some formatting information but preserving the actual prose. The distil-
lation tries to preserve information that has the highest semantic value. Knowledge 
of the data type also allows the reordering of traffic to minimize perceived latency. 
For example, if a user is reading a news update, text is given higher priority than 
images so that information of the highest semantic value is delivered to the user 
first.
The purpose of a distilled object is to allow the user to evaluate the value of 
the downloaded object and then request a higher-quality presentation of a specific 
section of the object later, if the user wishes to have it. For example, the user may 
zoom in to a particular section of an image and request a high-quality presenta-
tion of that section instead of the entire image, thus, putting a lower demand on 
bandwidth requirement. The distillation is performed by a proxy and this approach 
offers a number of advantages:
Instead of storing a few versions of an object to accommodate device capabil-
■
■
ity variations, servers store only high-quality content.
Servers do not bear the cost of performing the distillation.
■
■
No changes are required on legacy servers.
■
■
Simple and inexpensive clients can rely on the proxy to optimize content 
■
■
from servers designed for higher-end clients.
Clients communicate only with the proxy instead of possibly multiple 
■
■
servers.

Issues in Mobile Computing  175
A service provider may offer distillation and refinement as a value-added ser-
■
■
vice, resulting in an economic model favorable to the service provider, clients, 
and servers.
The proxy uses the distillers to optimize the QoS for the clients in real time. The 
network connection monitor (NCM) monitors end-to-end bandwidth and connec-
tivity to the proxy’s clients and notifies the proxy of any changes that may affect the 
proxy’s transcoding decisions. Client applications are linked with an APS library 
that provides a standard API for communicating with the proxy. Proxy-unaware 
applications communicate with the proxy via a client-side agent. The NCM deter-
mines a client’s network connection characteristics by tracking the value of effective 
bandwidth, round trip latency, and the probability of packet error. Alternatively, 
the client may notify the proxy of its expected bandwidth.
A client does not communicate directly with the server; it only communicates 
with the proxy. The proxy retrieves content from Internet servers on the client’s 
behalf, determines the high-level types of the various components (e.g., images, text 
runs), and determines which distillation engines to employ. When the proxy calls 
a distiller, it passes information such as the hardware characteristics of the client, 
acceptable encodings, and available network bandwidth. This information is used by 
the distiller to optimize the object representation; for example, the distiller optimizes 
an image according to the display size. A user may specify a maximum acceptable 
end-to-end latency for the delivery of an image to reduce end-to-end latency.
8.6	
Seamless Mobility over 
Heterogeneous Wireless Networks
The explosive growth of wireless communications has resulted in several indepen-
dent and autonomous networks. As mobile users move, they encounter different 
types of networks offering different levels of services. For example, they may move 
from a WLAN environment that offers tens of megabits per second to a cellular 
network that offers tens to hundreds of kilobits per second. The type of services 
available and the QoS offered also vary. To provide seamless mobility, these varia-
tions should be masked from the users so that they receive integrated services.
One of the goals of a mobile computing environment is to mask the heteroge-
neity of the underlying technologies by presenting a uniform environment to the 
users. A mobile device with multiple network interfaces should be able to move 
between different proprietary networks seamlessly without disturbing the appli-
cations. The applications are equipped with system support that are capable of 
adapting to dynamic QoS variations gracefully. Ideally, the services that are avail-
able to the user in a WLAN should also be available via cellular service albeit at a 
reduced QoS level. To support seamless mobility, adaptive computing is required. 

176  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
A graceful reaction to sudden QoS changes is possible if the environment and 
applications collaboratively adapt to the dynamic operating conditions.
To provide support for seamless mobility, the following factors have to be 
considered:
A wireless network is often autonomously owned and operated. It is unlikely 
■
■
that its BSs will be accessible for software changes to support seamless 
mobility. Whatever solutions must operate using off-the-shelf commercial 
networks.
Wireless networks may vary in terms of bandwidth, latency, channel error, 
■
■
range, access protocol, failure probability, connection cost, pricing structure, 
and security.
Mobile devices have varying capabilities. Among factors to consider are com-
■
■
puting power, memory, network interfaces, disk space, compression tech-
niques, battery power, and operating system.
A mobile device will encounter a variable QoS depending on its current con-
■
■
nections due to the dynamic nature of the environment.
As a user moves, connections may be set up or torn down, and this may also 
involve QoS changes. When moving within the same network, a user may move 
from a noncongested cell to a congested cell. There are three application-level 
approaches that can be used to deal with QoS variation:
	
1.	Applications support a seamless mobile computing environment without 
notification of QoS change. This approach does not work well when QoS 
changes by orders of magnitude, for example, from a WLAN environment 
into a WMAN environment.
	
2.	Applications are allowed to (re)negotiate QoS with the network. If the net-
work could not honor the negotiated QoS, the application is alerted.
	
3.	Applications list acceptable QoS classes, which is the procedure to execute if a 
QoS class is granted and the exception handling policy if the network violates 
the QoS agreement. The mobile computing environment handles the QoS 
(re)negotiation and reaction to notification.
There are three approaches to support dynamic QoS (re)negotiation:
	
1.	The mobile computing environment provides the measured QoS in a format 
that can be retrieved by the applications. Applications poll the environment 
periodically to retrieve the current value and adapt accordingly.
	
2.	As an addition to the first approach, an application registers with the environ-
ment its acceptable QoS bounds. The application is notified if the bounds are 
violated and adapts accordingly.
	
3.	The application program is split into ranges separated by QoS system calls. 
In each call, the application specifies a sequence of acceptable QoS classes, 

Issues in Mobile Computing  177
the procedure to execute if each class is satisfied, and the exception handling 
if there is a change in the QoS level. In case there is a change in the QoS 
level, notification is handled by the exception handling procedure, which 
may either block, abort, rollback, or continue.
A mobile device may have access to multiple wireless networks at a time; for 
example, a PDA may be able to access the local WLAN service and at the same 
time is able to access services provided by the user’s 3G network operator. Which 
network to choose for data transport depends on the application traffic character-
istics, wireless network characteristics, transmission priority, and cost. Migration 
between networks occurs for a number of reasons, such as user mobility, network 
failure or partition, or application-dependent tradeoffs. Seamless mobility requires 
that the process of switching between networks is done transparently. There are 
four levels of mobility:
	
1.	Handoff within an organization and a network: A mobile user moves between 
two cells of the same service provider within a network.
	
2.	Handoff between organizations but within the same network: A user switches 
between service providers on the same network, for example, switches carriers 
while using the same cellular phone line.
	
3.	Migration within the organization but between networks: A mobile user 
switches between networks of the same service provider, for example, between 
a cellular phone and a cellular digital packet data service of the same carrier.
	
4.	Migration between organizations and networks: A mobile user switches both 
networks and service provider, for example, switches between locally owned 
WLAN to a GSM service.
To support seamless mobility, the following constraints must be observed. A 
mobile user may migrate between different networks that are owned and operated 
autonomously. The networks may use different protocol stacks, especially on the 
lower layers. Service stations on different networks may not be able to communicate 
with each other directly for mobility support. Finally, it is likely that each network 
has its own unique address for the mobile device.
8.7	
Other Issues in Mobile Application Design
When developing an application, whether for desktop computers or mobile devices, 
it is imperative for the system designer to understand not only the requirements of 
the application, but also how the target users will use the applications. What makes 
designing mobile applications more challenging is the fact that a number of assump-
tions about developing desktop applications are not valid in a mobile environment.
Designing and developing mobile applications are significantly different from 
designing applications for desktops due to various constraints of mobile devices and 

178  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
the mobile environment. Limitations on the device display, processing capability, 
and bandwidth have to be taken into consideration. Moreover, the designer has to 
keep in mind that mobile devices are not used in the same way as desktop comput-
ers are used. For example, while a salesperson might have no problem using a PDA 
with a stylus pen for input when updating a database, a service technician at a car 
manufacturing plant might find it inconvenient to use a mobile device that requires 
both hands for data input. The technician might prefer a means of input that is 
hands-free and does not demand much attention. When designing a mobile system, 
the physical configuration should be determined by its operation. This is just one 
example of how a thorough understanding of how users carry out their tasks and 
how they interact with one another in a social and organizational setting is critical 
in designing a good and effective mobile application.
In this section, you will learn about various constraints and considerations that 
must be kept in mind when designing mobile applications. You will see that the 
factors to consider may vary greatly depending on the applications and their operat-
ing environments.
8.7.1	 Mobile Service Design for Service 
Technicians in Industrial Settings
An ethnographic field study was carried out on Volvo cars and trucks to deter-
mine what service and maintenance personnel did, whom they talked to during 
their shift, and their work practices (Fallman 2002). The information obtained was 
later used to develop a mobile information system prototype that can be used by 
the personnel without turning it into a work procedure. Table 8.1 summarizes the 
observations and design incentives of this study.
The prototype developed is a PDA-based, arm-worn, gesture-driven, and con-
text-aware embodied system that supports useful and interconnected activities 
for service and maintenance work in industrial assembly settings. The device is 
attached to a user’s arm, allowing the user to interact directly with objects in the 
physical environment. Users use their hands to point directly to a physical object to 
initiate interaction. The prototype is developed using a customized Compaq iPaq 
H3660 with a 206-MHz Intel Strong ARM 32-bit processor, a color reflective thin 
film transistor liquid crystal display, 64-MB memory, and a RS323 serial commu-
nication port. The operating system is Microsoft Pocket PC 2002. The prototype 
is also equipped with a RF ID tag (RFID) reader and a 2G accelerometer sensor, 
which are put in a physical glovelike configuration worn on a user’s arm.
The context-aware functions provided are component history and virtual notice 
board functions. The history function allows the technician to access all previous 
maintenance and service carried out on a component. The virtual notice boards 
allow technicians to leave voice notes, for example, to explain a problem about 
a component and what action has been taken. This function reduces the level of 

Issues in Mobile Computing  179
Table 8.1  Summary of observation and design incentive of the case study.
Observation
Design Incentive
Service technicians did not repair components that broke down. Because 
the components were sent away for repair, there was no need for mobile 
access to manuals or extensive help on repair work. However, the 
technicians would benefit with help on how to remove, install, and 
replace components. Moreover, a new employee often had difficulty 
with procedures that suggested many different types of installations.
Equip service technicians with digital access to blueprints 
because manuals were rarely used. 
When a component broke down, the technician often used the DECT 
phone to call the manufacturer of the component to speak to a person 
with the appropriate expertise to deal with the problem. An alternative 
was to use a graphical blueprint instead of a manual for troubleshooting.
Provide quick and easy access to manufacturers of 
components. 
Service technicians had a problem determining the availability of spare 
parts. If a component had to be replaced, the technician had to either go 
to the office to use a desktop computer to determine whether the spare 
part was available or go to the stock room to find the spare part.
Provide quick access to spare part inventory to allow the 
technicians to decide whether to carry out an on-site 
repair, to immediately replace a component with a spare 
part, or to troubleshoot the problem offline. Another 
benefit of providing this information is that an order can 
be placed if a spare part is depleted. 
Service technicians commented that they would benefit from information 
about the history of each component; for instance, if a component had 
been replaced a few times within a week, it indicated that the problem 
was not with the component but something else. At the time, this 
information was conveyed using a notice board. This was not an efficient 
method as sometimes a repair or replacement of a component was not 
documented immediately and, thus, was unknown to other technicians. 
Notebooks were scattered throughout the factory but were largely 
unused because they were not physically close to the assembly cell.
A history of a component is provided in front of the 
component instead of having to look it up at the office. 
The system incorporates a virtual noticeboard or notebook 
so that it can be close to an object (component) that it 
describes. By making it virtual, a technician can access all 
notebooks via one mobile device. 
Service technicians did not have a complete list of telephone numbers of 
people they had to collaborate with. When they had to find a number 
quickly, they often asked the nearest manager (managers were equipped 
with PalmPilot PDAs) to look up the telephone number.
Service technicians are provided with a list of useful telephone 
numbers that are divided into a few categories, such as 
managers, forepersons, manufacturers, and service 
technicians currently on the shift. 

180  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
effort required to leave notes (no need to sit down, find the right folder, and write a 
report) and makes the notes available to other technicians more quickly, hassle-free. 
The system does not incorporate digital manuals as the service technicians rarely 
make use of them. They are, however, provided with quick access to manufacturers’ 
contact information so that a manufacturer can be contacted quickly whenever the 
need arises.
8.7.2	 Mobile Commerce
In the past few years, businesses have had to adapt to the use of new technologies to 
remain competitive. One of the strategies that have been adopted by many compa-
nies is e-commerce that has changed the face of the business from physical offices 
and business facilities to a virtual, click-on-a-Web-site-type of businesses that make 
it possible for us to spend and invest our hard-earned money from the comfort of 
our homes.
Recently, another similar transition has emerged and this evolution is marked 
by an effort to incorporate the Web sites of the businesses into the small screens of 
mobile phones. Businesses can now present their storefronts not only on Web sites, 
but also on mobile devices so customers can now spend their money or view similar 
information without being confined to their desktops. This opens the opportu-
nity for businesses to be conducted anytime, anywhere. This class of application 
is known as mobile commerce (m-commerce). One classification of m-commerce 
applications that is becoming more available is the mobile payment service. Exam-
ples of services in this category are e-wallet, mobile banking, bill payment, and 
fund transfer, which can be done via the mobile device. The advances in network 
and device capabilities have enabled new features of mobile applications that could 
further increase their usability.
As mentioned earlier, mobile users often perform a few tasks simultane-
ously. To consider this multitasking behavior, m-commerce interfaces should be 
designed to support users’ limited attention. The interface design has to compen-
sate for the limited visual display of mobile devices. The 7C (context, content, 
community, customization, communication, connection, commerce) design ele-
ments may be adapted when designing an interface for m-commerce (Lee and 
Benbasat 2003).
	
1.	Context: Links should connect pages seamlessly and efficiently to ease naviga-
tion without demanding too much of users’ attention. A shallow-structured 
menu (fewer levels but more choices per level) is preferable because a deep 
hierarchy imposes a higher cognitive burden by offering more choices over 
more levels.
	
2.	Content: Refers to what a site presents, such as the offering, appeal, multi-
media content and content type. A context-aware functionality may be used 

Issues in Mobile Computing  181
to adapt the product information (offering mix) and promotional messages 
(appeal mix) offered to users. A proximate selection method is used to empha-
size nearby objects and make choices easier. Using audio content instead of text 
would reduce the amount of display space required.
	
3.	Community: Refers to interactive and noninteractive communications between 
users. Most people enjoy shopping with friends and like to exchange opinions 
about products. Interactive communication enables the exchange of opinions 
and can be realized using, for example, SMS.
	
4.	Customization: Many Web sites allow users to personalize their experience 
when visiting the sites. Likewise, a user’s mobile setting can be used to auto-
matically adapt the mobile interface. This customization reduces the infor-
mation load by filtering information not of interest to the user, thus, reducing 
the burden on the limited visual display.
	
5.	Communication: Refers to the dialogue between sites and users. This may 
be in the form of broadcast, interactive, or a hybrid of the two. Advertis-
ing, for instance via SMS, ought to be tailored according to users’ context. 
The advertisement could also take into consideration factors such as time 
and weather, for example, a special offer on ice cream on a hot afternoon 
at a nearby cafe. Feedbacks from users may be obtained using multiple-
choice answers (often used in SMS quizzes) to reduce the hassle of using 
the limited keypad. Alternatively, voice and multimedia mail transfer may 
be used.
	
6.	Connection: Refers to formal linkages between sites that consists of out-
sourced content, percentage of home site content, and pathways of con-
nections. Pathways to other sites provide users with information needed in 
dynamic settings. Using location information, an adaptive pathway links 
only to Web sites of nearby stores to reduce the number of pathways.
	
7.	Commerce: Refers to interfaces related to sales of products and services. A 
secure payment method that demands minimal attention is required. A one-
click checkout can be made available by taking advantage of a user profile 
that can be configured and later used in subsequent transactions. The user 
profile consists of information such as user’s name, address, and preferred 
delivery option.
There are a few other factors to consider when developing an m-commerce 
application. Advertisements should be limited to avoid overwhelming users with 
information and to avoid the possibility of congestion of the wireless links. If UIs 
are hard to deal with, users may not see significant value in m-commerce appli-
cations. Out-of-context information makes the experience unpleasant to users. 
Finally, the financial value of m-commerce applications makes security an impor-
tant aspect to consider and security measures must be thought of carefully when 
the application is designed. Security should not be something that is added as an 
afterthought.

8.7.3	 Aura: A Platform for Context-Aware Applications
Human attention is a user’s ability to attend to primary tasks while ignoring ­system-
generated distractions such as error messages. Project Aura (Garlan et al. 2002) pro-
posed two concepts to minimize distractions to users:
	
1.	Proactivity: A system layer is able to anticipate requests from a higher layer. 
This is unlike the established approach in current use where each layer only 
reacts to the layer above it.
	
2.	Self-tuning: Layers adapt by observing the demands made on them and 
adjusting their performance and resource usage characteristics accordingly.
Garlan et al. (2002) give the following scenarios to demonstrate how proactivity 
and self-tuning reduces demand on user attention by minimizing distraction.
Scenario 1
Jane is at Gate 23 of an airport, waiting for her flight. She has edited 
many large documents and would like to use her wireless connection 
to e-mail them. Unfortunately, connection is very slow because many 
passengers in the area are surfing the Web. Aura observes that at the 
current available bandwidth, Jane would not be able to finish send-
ing her documents before her flight departs. Consulting the airport’s 
wireless network bandwidth service and flight schedule service, Aura 
discovers that wireless bandwidth is excellent at Gate 15, and that there 
are no departing or arriving flights at nearby gates for half an hour. A 
dialog box pops up on Jane’s screen suggesting that she go to Gate 15 
and displays how long it would take her to walk there. It also asks her 
to prioritize her e-mails so that the critical ones are transmitted first. 
Jane accepts the suggestion and walks to Gate 15. She watches the news 
on a nearby TV until Aura informs her that it has almost completed 
sending her messages so she can start walking back. The last message is 
transmitted during her walk and she is back at Gate 23 in time for her 
boarding call.
Scenario 2
Fred is in his office, preparing for a meeting at which he will give a 
presentation and a software demonstration. The meeting room is a one-
minute walk across campus. It is time to leave, but Fred is not quite 
ready. He grabs his Palm XXII wireless handheld computer and walks 
out the door. Aura transfers his work from his desktop to his hand-
held and lets him make his final edits using voice commands during 
his walk. Aura infers where Fred is going from his calendar and the 
campus location-tracking service. It downloads the presentation and 

Issues in Mobile Computing  183
the demonstration software to the projection computer and warms up 
the projector. Fred finishes his edits just before he enters the meeting 
room. As he walks in, Aura transfers his final changes to the projection 
computer. As the presentation proceeds, Fred is about to display a slide 
with highly sensitive budget information. Aura senses that this might 
be a mistake as the room’s face detection and recognition capability 
indicates that there are unfamiliar faces present and warns Fred. Real-
izing that Aura is right, Fred skips that slide.
In Scenario 1, Aura is proactive in estimating how long it would take for Jane to 
send her documents. When suggesting that Jane go to Gate 15, it combines knowl-
edge from different system layers. Determining available bandwidth and conges-
tion is a lower layer functionality and determining flight arrival or departure time 
is an application layer functionality. Aura takes advantage of smart spaces when it 
determines bandwidth availability at other gates and estimates the time it takes to 
walk there.
In Scenario 2, the execution state is transferred across diverse platforms: Fred 
is able to transfer his presentation from his desktop to his Palm to the projection 
computer. Self-tuning is illustrated through Fred’s ability to edit his presentation 
using speech input instead of a keyboard. Aura is proactive when it infers where 
Fred is heading based on his calendar and the location-tracking service, warms 
up the projector, transfers the presentation to the projection computer, and senses 
that the budget information should not be presented at that meeting—these also 
involve the use of smart spaces.
Aura uses cyber foraging to extend the capabilities of resource-constrained 
mobile devices by making use of compute servers or data staging servers that 
are connected to the Internet via a wired infrastructure. These servers are surro-
gates. Staging data on surrogates reduces the impact of end-to-end Internet delay. 
Although the use of caching can mask delay, cache misses may still happen, for 
example, because a mobile device does not have a cache large enough to store all rel-
evant data. A cache miss may also occur when a file unexpectedly becomes relevant 
to the user; for example, the user receives a phone call from a client that requires the 
user to access a file that was previously considered unimportant.
Aura has a task layer, named Prism (Figure 8.2), that is a new abstraction to 
capture user intent. Prism is placed above individual applications and services. By 
introducing a new layer to explicitly represent user intent, the rest of the system 
has a basis on which to adapt or anticipate a user’s needs (the example in scenario 
1). In addition to supporting context observation that is appropriate for the envi-
ronment, it also provides an environment management infrastructure that assists 
with resource monitoring and adaptation. These capabilities are encapsulated in the 
following components: task manager, context observer, and environment manager 
(Figure 8.3). The service supplier provides the support to carry out a user’s task.

184  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Figure 8.4 shows an application of Prism’s architecture. Fred’s home environ-
ment cooperates with his office environment. When Fred leaves home to go to work 
his home context observer alerts the home task manager. The task manager check-
points the state of the running services platform-independently and causes the local 
environment manager to pause the services. This information and Fred’s task state 
are stored in a distributed file space. When Fred enters his office environment, the 
office context observer detects his presence and informs the office task manager to 
reinstantiate the tasks by finding and configuring service suppliers in the new envi-
ronment. The reconfiguration tries to maximize the use of local resources based on 
various resource utility functions specified by the task.
Prism’s architectural framework provides a means to capture user intent to 
guide the search for suitable configurations in each environment. Tasks are rep-

resented as service coalitions. This helps Aura to determine when to support the 
essential services in a task and whether the services should be instantiated jointly. 
If a service cannot be provided, a user is given an early warning. The infrastructure 
then searches the heterogeneous environment for appropriate matches to provide 
the services. By providing the environment with self-monitoring capabilities, the 
infrastructure can detect when task requirements (such as minimum response time) 
are not met and can deploy alternative configurations to support the task. Aura is 
used to build the PHD discussed in chapter 1.
In context-aware applications such as HyperAudio and HIPS (Petrelli et al. 
2001), described in Chapter 1, the challenge is deducing the next course of action 
for the system as the visitor moves to view the displays. If the visitor is detected 
standing in front of a certain display, the system presents information relevant to 
the display of interest. The components in the application that are responsible for 
deciding the visitor’s context and what information to present are the input ana-
lyzer and the composer engine, which are rule-based modules. Rules are composed 
of a condition and an action. When the condition is satisfied, the rule is triggered 
and an action is performed. A condition is a set of tests on context variables that 
is continually updated. The context may be the visitor’s position, the display he is 
looking at, or history information (e.g., information retrieved). Rules are applied to 
accomplish a certain task.
When a user approaches a new exhibit, the system reacts by sending a presenta-
tion, but this is not always the correct action. Consider the situation in which the 
visitor is listening to a presentation and moves toward a new exhibit. Should the 
system stop the current presentation or start a new one? The most appropriate action 
to take may depend on factors other than the visitor’s movements, for example, the 
type of presentation currently running. If it concerns the object previously in focus

it has to be interrupted or shortened because reference to the space is no longer valid. 
If the content of the presentation is general, then a full delivery is an acceptable 
behavior.
The use of context-awareness is helpful in minimizing error, for example, in a 
clinical application (Grasso 2004). To update a patient’s data, the physician has to 
select the application, search for the correct patient and access relevant data about 
the patient. This would not only incur a small delay in accessing the patient’s data 
but there is also a margin of error where a wrong patient’s record might be selected. 
This process does not occur in a manual system where a physician simply picks 
up the patient’s chart. Context-awareness may help eliminate this delay and the 
possibility of error by detecting the physician’s location. When it detects that the 
physician has entered a particular room and is standing next to a patient’s bed, 
the system automatically downloads the patient’s relevant data to the physician’s 
handheld. Location information can also be used as a passive security measure to 
deny access to data stored on the device when the device is not located within the 
vicinity of the hospital.
8.7.4	 Mobile Work
When you work in an office, you work in a familiar environment. Your desktop is 
configured to suit your needs. You know where the photocopier and fax machine 
are located. If something breaks down, you know who to contact for support ser-
vices. On the contrary, when you work away from your office, you are in an unfa-
miliar environment that may be very different from what you are used to. When 
you are at the airport, you cannot be certain how much bandwidth is available to 
you. If there are several users downloading large files, that might slow down your 
access to retrieve an important document that you need. You may have to make use 
of service discovery to find a printer near you.
When designing a mobile application or mobile device for use in any envi-
ronment, it is imperative that it does not get in the way of work that is currently 
being carried out. The mobile application or device should be able to integrate into 
the existing environment without requiring its users to change the way they work 
significantly. Otherwise, the application or device would fail to meet its objec-
tive. The study discussed in section 8.7.1 illustrates the importance of understand-
ing the users’ working habits so that the application developed enhances the way 
they perform their tasks without requiring them to change the way they work 
significantly.
One of the objectives of mobility support is anywhere access. However, even 
though anywhere access is possible, it might not always be acceptable. For example, 
your colleague may be able to call you on your mobile phone, but you might not 
want to have the conversation in the presence of strangers who can overhear your 

Issues in Mobile Computing  187
discussion. Likewise, even though anytime access is possible, most people might 
not like to be contacted after what is an acceptable work hour.
In certain cases, knowing the user context is imperative before deciding to 
deliver particular information to the user. For example, while you are driving, you 
receive a call from a colleague who needs to clarify a few points regarding a docu-
ment with you. For the communication to be effective, you need to see the docu-
ment. Even though it is possible to deliver it to your device, it is not advisable as it 
may distract you from your driving.
Lack of awareness of a recipient’s activity, time, and place may impact the 
rhythm of collaboration interaction between mobile workers and colleagues. For 
example, your colleague asked you to look at the attachment she e-mailed to you. 
You receive the e-mail but are unable to view the entire content due to the restric-
tions of your device. In this case, there is a mismatch in rhythm that results in 
problems in the ongoing collaboration activity.
One of the characteristic difficulties of mobile work is that there is less predict-
ability and more restricted access to information and artifacts. Mobile workers do 
not know when they will have access to the Internet or what the quality of the con-
nection will be when it is available. When traveling on business trips, mobile work-
ers usually plan for all possibilities. In addition to bringing electronic documents, 
they also bring the hardcopy of the documents. Paper is flexible and is easier to 
access, whereas a laptop is unsuitable in certain circumstances. For example, when 
in a plane, reading paper documents is preferable and more convenient than access-
ing it from a laptop due to space constraints. A laptop and mobile phone can pro-
vide access to unanticipated documents. Mobile workers do not need to carry their 
offices with them: They just need to carry the means to access its functionality.

Summary
Developing mobile applications, especially in a smart environment, is more complex 
than developing traditional applications. Several additional issues need to be con-
sidered, and it requires a different way of thinking. Unlike the traditional environ-
ment where we can assume that users or applications will have a certain amount of 
resources available to them, similar guarantees may be invalid in a wireless environ-
ment as resources become available and disappear with time. The level or amount of 
resources available may also vary with time. Applications have to react correctly to 
these variations so that users can complete their tasks successfully. To accomplish 
this, support for adaptive behavior must be embedded in mobile application.
Heterogeneity is one of the important aspects that have to be kept in mind. The 
heterogeneity of devices makes it hard to design an application that is useful across 
different types of devices with various capabilities and functionalities. The type of 
data that can be delivered to the users must be tailored according to the formats 
that are supported by their devices. Data distillation is a technique used to deliver 

188  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
data in a format that is supported by a device while preserving most of the semantic 
content of data object by taking into consideration network, hardware and software 
constraints, and variations.
Alternatives to the conventional interface are needed because mobile users often per-
form multiple tasks. Interfaces that demand users’ attention or that require a two-hand 
input are unsuitable as it may distract users from their tasks. Tactile interface is a means 
of providing an interface that is discreet and nonobtrusive. An alternative is a tilting 
interface where a device is equipped with a tilt or pressure sensor to provide a means of 
interaction that does not require two-handed input; for example, a user can scroll down a 
document by tilting a device. The scrolling stops when the device is returned to a neutral 
position.
Power conservation is important to prolong the duration between recharge. The 
strategies often involve powering down power hungry components such as the trans-
ceiver, display, hard disk, and CPU during idle periods. Applications should be designed 
to use power economically. In addition to power conservation, energy scavenging or 
harvesting offer attractive alternatives to powering up mobile devices. Currently, even 
though the amount of power that can be scavenged is on the order of milli- or micro-
watts, ongoing research in this area may offer better results in the future.
In the past decade, we have seen a transition in the way businesses are conducted 
from the physical stores to virtual stores on the Internet. The next transition is pro-
viding access to products and services via mobile devices. At the moment, mobile 
banking services are already available. One of the main concerns stated by users 
in a survey is security (Llazani and Othman 2004). Most respondents are skepti-
cal about the security of conducting business transactions on their mobile devices. 
Constraints of processing power on mobile devices makes using strong encryption 
unviable.
Most mobile applications available today are targeted at teenagers and young pro-
fessionals and are mostly infotainment applications, such as music download, friend 
locator, and news update. Mobile applications targeted for the enterprise environment 
that utilize smart space are not currently available in the market. Several issues need to 
be addressed satisfactorily to provide this type of application. We probably will have to 
wait a few more years to see the ubiquitous computing environment as envisioned by 
Mark Wiser becomes a reality.

Chapter 9
Location-Sensing and 
Location Systems
An important aspect of mobile computing is not only to allow users access to infor-
mation anywhere, anytime but also to give information that is relevant to the user’s 
context. In most cases, the user’s location is an important factor in determining the 
user’s context. For example, if I am in Seoul and I request for a list of restaurants, 
I would like to be presented with a list of restaurants near my vicinity, not a list of 
restaurants in Kuala Lumpur. For the system to deliver location-sensitive informa-
tion, the system has to be able to detect my location and tailor the information 
delivered to me to meet my needs. This chapter discusses techniques to determine a 
user’s location and how it is used in location-aware applications.
9.1	
Location-Sensing Techniques
Let us start with definitions of the following terms:
Positioning systems: Provide the means to determine location and leave it up 
N
N
to users to compute their actual position. GPS is an example of a positioning 
system. There are two approaches to implement a positioning system: ­self-
positioning and remote positioning. In a self-positioning system, a mobile 
device uses signals transmitted by gateways or antennas to calculate its own 
position. In a remote positioning system, the position of a mobile device or a 
tagged object is determined by measuring signals detected by a set of receiv-
ers. Signal measurements are used to determine the location of the object of 
interest.

192  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Tracking systems: Monitor objects in their purview without involving the 
N
N
tracked objects in the computation.
Location sensing: A hybrid of the previous two systems, whether by design or 
N
N
configuration. The policy of manipulating location data is separate from the 
mechanism of pinpointing the object. Many systems are in this category.
There are three classifications of location-sensing techniques: triangulation, 
proximity, and scene analysis (Hightower and Borriello 2001).
9.1.1	 Triangulation
Triangulation is divided into lateration and angulation. Lateration involves using 
distance measurements. The 2D position of an object is calculated by measuring its 
distance from three noncollinear points. Let us say you are lost somewhere and you 
have absolutely no idea where you are. You ask a passerby, “I’m lost. Where am I?” 
He replies, “You’re 30 km from Bangi.” You draw a circle on your map to mark your 
possible location. It is helpful but does not tell you exactly where you are because 
you could be anywhere within a 30-km radius from Bangi (Figure 9.1a). You ask 
another person the same question, and he says, “You’re about 40 km from Kajang.” 
That is slightly better. You can narrow down your location to the intersection area 
of the two circles (Figure 9.1b). A third person tells you that you are about 10 km 
from Serdang. You draw another circle on your map and the intersection point 
gives you your location—you are in Seri Kembangan (Figure 9.1c). This is how 2D 
lateration works.
Four non-coplanar points are required to calculate a 3D position (latitude, lon-
gitude, and altitude) of an object. A 2D position would be sufficient, for example, 
in an implementation involving an active badge that tracks the location of users or 
objects in an office environment. On the other hand, a 3D position would be more 
helpful when sending a team to rescue climbers trapped in an avalanche.
There are four approaches to measuring distance:
	
1.	Direct: Involves using a physical action or movement to take a measurement; 
for example, a robot can take measurements using a tape measure. Obviously, 
this is not practical when dealing with roaming users and objects.
	
2.	Time-of-flight: Involves measuring the distance between an object (station-
ary or moving) to a point P by measuring the time it takes to travel between 
the object and P at a known velocity. For example, because sound travels at a 
speed of 344 m/s, an ultrasound pulse transmitted by an object that arrives 
at P 14.5 ms later means that the object is 5 m away from P. If this technique 
is used, clock synchronization becomes an issue. If only one measurement 
is required, such as round trip time, the transmitter of the signal is also the 
receiver, and therefore, it needs to maintain its own clock with sufficient pre-
cision to calculate the distance. On the other hand, because a GPS receiver 

Location-Sensing and Location Systems  193
is not synchronized with the satellites, it is unable to measure accurately the 
time a signal takes to reach it. Therefore, GPS satellites are precisely syn-
chronized with each other and transmit their local time in the signal so that 
receivers can compute the difference in time-of-flight. A GPS receiver calcu-
lates a 3D position using four satellites. All of the 24 GPS satellites contain 
4 cesium or rubidium atomic clocks that are locally averaged to maintain a 
time accuracy of 1 part in 1023 s.
	
3.	Attenuation: The decrease in signal intensity as the distance from the signal 
source increases. It is possible to measure the distance between an object and 
P using a function that correlates attenuation, the distance for a type of emis-
sion, and the original strength of the emission. For example, a radio signal is 
attenuated by a factor proportional to 1/r2, where r is the distance from the 
source emitting the signal. Using attenuation is not as accurate as using time-
of-flight due to obstructions in an indoor environment, reflection, refraction, 
and multipath propagation.
	
4.	Angulation: Involves using angle or bearing measurements instead of distance. 
A 2D angulation involves two angle measurements and one length measure-
ment as illustrated in Figure 9.2. On the other hand, a 3D angulation requires

one length measurement, one azimuth measurement, and two angle measure-
ments. An example of the use of angulation is where phased antenna arrays 
comprising multiple antennas with known separation measure the arrival of a 
signal. The angle from the source of signal emission is calculated based on the 
differences in arrival times and the geometry of the receiving array.
9.1.2	 Proximity
Proximity is a location-sensing technique that involves determining when an object 
is near a known location. There are three approaches:
	
1.	Detection of physical contact using pressure sensors, touch sensors, and 
capacitive field detectors.
	
2.	Monitoring wireless cellular APs involves detecting when a mobile device is 
within the range of one or more APs in a wireless cellular network.
	
3.	Observing automatic ID systems involves using automatic ID systems such as 
credit card point-of-sale, telephone records, computer login history, and use 
of ATM card. For example, the location of a person driving on a highway can 
be inferred from the last time that person used a Touch-n-Go card because 
the scanner that reads the card has a static, known location. 
9.1.3	 Scene Analysis
Scene analysis uses features of a scene observed from a vantage point to deduce the 
location of the observer to objects in the scene. The observed scenes are simplified 
to obtain features that are easy to represent and compare. There are two types of 
scene analysis:
0°
Known Length
Angle 2
Angle 1

degree reference vector and the distance between two reference points. 

Location-Sensing and Location Systems  195
	
1.	In static scene analysis, observed features are cross-referenced to a predefined 
dataset to map them to object locations.
	
2.	In differential scene analysis, the differences between successive scenes are 
tracked to estimate location. The differences correspond to movements of 
the observer. If the features are identified as being at a specific location, the 
observer can determine its own position relative to them.
The scene may be visual images captured by a camera or other measurable phys-
ical phenomena, such as the electromagnetic characteristics that occur when an 
object is at a particular position and orientation.
9.2	
A Taxonomy of Location Systems
Location systems are characterized by the following properties (Hightower and 
Borriello 2001b):
Physical and symbolic locations: A location system can provide two types 
N
N
of information: physical position and symbolic position. Physical position 
gives the absolute location of an object; for example, a GPS system gives 
the latitude, longitude, and altitude information to locate an object at its 
exact location. A symbolic position is relative, for example, in the lab on 
the second floor. A symbolic position is often based on proximity, such as a 
bar code scanner or an access card to a building. Depending on the require-
ments of an application, the location information may be physical or sym-
bolic. For example, symbolic position is sufficient for an active badge. An 
application may also use both types of information. Symbolic position can 
be used to augment physical position; for example, a GPS coordinate (physi-
cal position) that determines a tourist’s location is used to locate the nearest 
breakdown service center (symbolic position) for the tourist who is stranded 
on a highway.
Absolute or relative: An absolute location system uses a shared reference grid 
N
N
for all located objects; for example, a GPS system uses latitude, longitude, 
and altitude. On the other hand, a relative location system allows an object to 
have its own frame of reference, for example, a user’s position to the nearest 
Thai restaurant.
Localized location computation: An object may compute its location locally. 
N
N
Local computation protects privacy, as no other object in the system may 
know the location of another object unless informed by the object itself. For 
example, GPS satellites have no knowledge of who makes use of the signal 
they transmit. On the contrary, an object may emit a signal that can be used 
by other objects to deduce its location. The signal may be broadcast peri-
odically or in response to a request by another object. The infrastructure can 

196  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
then calculate the position of an object without involving the object in the 
computation. The advantage of this approach is the burden of performing the 
computation is placed on the infrastructure, hence, decreasing the computa-
tional and power demands on the object.
Accuracy and precision: Let us say a system is able to locate an object within 
N
N
a 10-m accuracy 95% of the time. The distance denotes accuracy (also 
termed grain size), and the percentage denotes precision (i.e., how often we 
can obtain that accuracy). Accuracy may be traded off for precision. Accu-
racy and precision may be improved using sensor fusion, where a number of 
location systems are integrated to form hierarchical and overlapping levels 
of resolution.
Scale: The scale of a location system refers to the coverage area per unit of 
N
N
infrastructure and the number of objects the system can locate per unit of 
infrastructure per time interval. For example, a location-sensing system may 
be able to locate objects within a room, a building, a campus, a city, or world-
wide. A GPS satellite can serve an unlimited number of receivers, whereas 
an electronic tag reader is unable to read any tag if the distance is beyond 
its range. Time is an important factor in determining the scale of a location 
system as available bandwidth imposes a limit on the frequency and the num-
ber of location updates within a time interval. For example, if the number of 
communications in a RF-based system exceeds a certain threshold, the chan-
nel would become congested.
Recognition: Certain applications need to recognize objects to determine the 
N
N
next course of action. For example, a scanner reads the tag on luggage at 
an airport and sends it to the correct claim carousel; a system allows a user 
access to certain parts of the building after the fingerprint scanner identi-
fies an authorized user. Among devices used by a system that incorporates 
recognition are cameras, scanners, and card readers. Generally, recognition 
techniques entail assigning a globally unique ID (GUID) to objects. The sys-
tem looks up the GUID in a database to determine, for example, the object 
access rights to resources.
Cost: The cost of a location-sensing system includes time cost (time needed 
N
N
to install the system), space cost (the amount of installed infrastructure and 
hardware’s size and form factor), and capital cost (price per unit or infrastruc-
ture element and salaries of support personnel).
Limitations: A system that functions well in one environment might not func-
N
N
tion as well in another environment. For example, IR systems are suitable for 
indoor use; a GPS system does not work indoors unless a GPS repeater is 
mounted on the building to rebroadcast the signals; certain tag readers can 
only read a tag correctly if there are no other tags nearby.

GPS: An Example of a Positioning System
The GPS is a constellation of 24 satellites orbiting the earth. It was developed by 
the U.S. military as a military navigation system but has been made available to 
the public. The satellites are at a distance of 20,000 km above earth’s surface. At 
any one time, four satellites cover a certain portion of the earth’s surface. A GPS 
receiver determines its location based on signals it receives from the four satellites.
We gave an example of how 2D lateration works in section 9.1.1. A GPS receiver 
uses a 3D lateration to calculate its position in 3D—latitude, longitude, and alti-
tude. Instead of three circles, imagine three spheres and their intersection point 
pinpoints your location. If you know that you are 1,000 km from Satellite 1, you 
could be anywhere on the surface of this imaginary sphere within a 10,000-km 
radius from the satellite. If you also know that you are 30,000 km from Satellite 
2, you can narrow down your location to the intersection area of two spheres. If 
you know your location from a third satellite, the intersection point of the spheres 
on the earth’s surface gives you your location. A GPS receiver usually uses signals 
from four satellites to improve accuracy and provide altitude information and can 
calculate its position with an accuracy of 10 m. How does a GPS receiver determine 
its distance from a satellite?
A GPS receiver picks up radio wave signals that travel at the speed of light 
from the satellites. The receiver determines its distance from the satellite based on 
how long a signal transmitted by the satellite takes to reach it. A satellite transmits 
a signal, termed a pseudorandom code, at predetermined intervals known by the 
receivers. When the satellite starts transmitting the code, the receiver starts to run 
the same code at exactly the same time. When the satellite’s signal reaches the 
receiver, its signal pattern will lag slightly behind the code the receiver is running. 
The amount of time the signal lags behind (the delay) is equal to the signal’s travel 
time. The receiver calculates its distance from the satellite by multiplying the delay 
by the speed of light (300,000 km/s). This calculation requires a receiver’s clock to 
be synchronized with the satellite’s clock.
DGPS is a technique to correct errors that may occur when a receiver calculates 
its location. A number of factors may cause the errors. First, an error occurs if the 
clocks are not perfectly synchronized. A receiver has to continuously reset its clock 
to be in sync with the satellite’s clock. Second, for the distance information to be 
useful, a receiver has to know the position of the satellites. This information can 
be easily obtained because satellites travel in orbits. The receiver stores an almanac 
that tells it where a satellite should be at a given time. The orbits may vary slightly 
due to the pull of the sun and the moon, but the Department of Defense monitors 
the satellite’s exact positions and transmits the adjustments to all receivers as part of 
the satellite’s signal. Another source of error is the assumption that the signal travels 
at the speed of light. In reality, the signal is slowed down slightly as it enters the 
earth’s atmosphere. This delay varies depending on where you are and cannot be 
factored in accurately when calculating the distance. Furthermore, radio signals are 

200  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
reflected off large objects, such as buildings, misleading the receiver into conclud-
ing that the satellite is farther away than its actual location. DGPS corrects these 
errors by estimating GPS inaccuracy at a stationary receiver station at a known 
location. Because this station knows its own location, it can easily calculate its 
receiver’s inaccuracy. It then broadcasts a signal containing correction information 
to all DGPS-equipped receivers in its areas.

Active Badge: An Example of a Tracking System
In certain work places, such as a hospital, the ability to keep track of employees 
and equipment is critical for efficient operation. Conventional methods to locate 
an employee are using the phone to call at all locations, a pager, or a public-address 
system. These methods are time-consuming and inefficient. An alternative is to tag 
the employees or objects and track their movements automatically, which is what 
has been done at the Olivetti Research Lab (Want et al. 1992), where an active 
badge, with a size of 55 × 55 × 7 mm, is used as a tag. The badge emits a unique 
code (beacon) for 1/10 of a second every 15 s. Sensors placed throughout the build-
ings pick up the beacons.
What is the rationale behind the chosen signaling rate? Emitting and detect-
ing signals consume power. Because power consumption is an important consid-
eration, the signaling rate must be chosen carefully. The 15-s interval minimizes 
power consumption so that the battery can last for up to one year. Furthermore, 
the system must be able to detect several people in the same locality. Because the 
signal duration is 1/10 s, the probability that two signals will collide is about 1 in 
150. Provided the number of people in the same locality is small, the probability 
that they will be detected is good.
Another power conservation strategy incorporated into the active badge is to 
turn off the badge when it is dark. As the level of lighting reduces, the period of the 
beacon signal is increased to an interval longer than 15 s. An ambient lighting envi-
ronment alters the interval only slightly. If the badge is placed in the drawer during 
weekend or periods away from the office, the badge stops emitting the beacon and 
battery lifetime increases by a factor of four.
IR was used for signaling for a number of reasons. Because IR technology has 
been used commercially, it is inexpensive and readily available for new applications. 
IR transmitters and detectors are small, cheap, and can operate within a 6-m range. 
Sensors that are placed throughout the building detect the beacon and the informa-
tion is used to identify the wearer’s location. A master station polls the sensors for 
sightings of the badges, processes the data, and makes it available to clients.
A sensor network must be in place to provide thorough coverage. Sensors are 
placed high up on walls, ceiling tiles, entrances, and exits of corridors and other 
public areas. An active badge system can be implemented on a network of its own 
or integrated to an existing computer network. The latter approach decreases the 

Location-Sensing and Location Systems  201
cost of implementing the system significantly. The implementation at Olivetti 
Research Ltd. (ORL), England, consists of an independent network that supports 
128 sensors. It allows workstations on an Ethernet network to support multiple 
badge networks. The data is relayed to the master station by conventional network 
protocols.
A badge network should be able to link all areas in a building with an arbitrary 
topology. Because there are many that are distributed in the building, possibly at 
remote places, power has to be fed through the network. Taking these factors into 
consideration, the badge-sensor network was designed as a four-wire network using 
conventional telephone twisted pairs. Two wires carry the network power supply, 
one carries the serial addressing information to allow the network controller to 
nominate a station, and the fourth carries data back to the network controller. To 
avoid requiring the network master to poll the sensors at high speed to avoid down-
link, the first in, first out queue is capable of buffering 20 badge sightings. This 
allows the network master to multiplex between polling the network, manipulating 
data, and making the data available to clients.
The system maintains a table that consists of the name of the badge’s owner, the 
nearest telephone extension, a description of the location, and the likelihood of find-
ing that person at the location (given as a percentage). A likelihood of less than 100% 
indicates that the person is moving around. If he has not been sighted in the last five 
minutes, the field contains the last time and location he was sighted. This system is 
used by receptionists to locate employees.
The location server system consists of four layers:
	
1.	Network controller: It is responsible for polling all sensors. Its polling strat-
egy can be adapted to test sensors that have recently detected badges more 
frequently than those that have not. It detects errors in badge ID format and 
removes erroneous data.
	
2.	Representation: Valid data extracted from the network is time-stamped and 
stored in a data structure that relates the badge ID to its location and the time 
it was sighted.
	
3.	Data processing: An active badge network can collect potentially a large 
amount of data. The data should reflect only the changes in badge locations 
or provide compressed summaries a badge’s recent history. The server was 
designed to compress the location information into a form that does not 
cause excessive traffic.
	
4.	Display interface: The location information extracted from the other three 
layers is used as the input to a display function that shows textual information 
about a badge’s changing location. Alternatively, a graphical interface may 
also be provided to the user.
Security and privacy are obvious concerns in using the system. Access to loca-
tion data is restricted to ORL staff members only. If a person does not wish to be 
tracked, he can simply take off the badge and put it in his drawer or leave it on his 

202  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
desk. A user is allowed to specify who can locate them and has access to informa-
tion about who has tried to locate them and how often.
9.5	
Modeling Location-Tracking Application
Location-tracking applications provide a means to track elderly people, vehicles, 
merchandise, and other objects. For example, a company offering courier service 
may need to keep track of which vehicle is the nearest to a particular building to 
pick up a package. A taxicab company needs to know which of its drivers are within 
a five-minute distance to a certain address to pick up a customer. A car-for-hire com-
pany wants to keep track of the locations of its cars. An emergency service needs to 
know which of its ambulances is the closest to an accident scene. These examples 
involve human-controlled moving objects, also termed roving users (RUs).
Tracking the location of RUs can be achieved easily by using GPS. However, 
many applications require more than just simple tracking of users. Current tech-
nology offers a set of location-time pairs that shows the RU’s location at a specific 
point in time. Due to technological constraints, the points in time may be minutes 
or hours apart, thus, it does not give accurate information of the location of a RU. 
This gives rise to the need to predict the location of users based on the last known 
location.
The techniques to predict location rely on estimates based on the object’s direc-
tion, last reported location, and speed. This simple prediction technique is not 
always reliable, especially for real-life applications, because it assumes that speed and 
direction stay constant. This assumption may be valid only in certain situations.
A better approach is to manipulate the fact that humans are creatures of habit 
(Abdelsalam and Ebrahim 2004). Users have unique goals, personalities, and tasks. 
The same user might behave differently in different situations; hence, there is an 
element of uncertainty in predicting a user’s location. One approach to predicting 
a user’s location more accurately is by incorporating individual characteristics, hab-
its, and preferences of a user. This involves building a user model that facilitates a 
more precise estimate of a user’s location.
A user model aims to describe the cognitive processes that underlie the user’s 
actions, the differences between the user’s skill, the user’s behavioral pattern or 
preferences, or the user’s personal characteristics. For example, to reach a destina-
tion, different lorry drivers may prefer different routes (e.g., choice of route may 
be influenced by the time of the day), stop at different rest areas, or refuel at dif-
ferent petrol stations. Gathering this information about each lorry driver enables 
the ­location-tracking application to make more accurate predictions. The estimate 
made is no longer solely dependent on the driver’s last known location and speed, 
but other unique characteristics that may influence the driver’s decision.
Before building the user model, a set of variables has to be collected, depending 
on the type of application to be developed. The main types of variables are:

Location-Sensing and Location Systems  203
Temporal variables: Represent when an event occurs, for example, time of the 
N
N
day, day of the week.
Spatial variables: Represent possible RU locations, for example, building, sec-
N
N
tion of a town, highway.
Environmental variables: Represent weather conditions, road conditions, and 
N
N
special events.
Behavioral variables: Represent typical speed, resting patterns, and preferred 
N
N
rest area.
These variables are used to build a set of causality relationships between them. 
For example, there may be two routes to go from A to B. Joe prefers to take route 
1, which is the shortest route but because route 1 is often very congested dur-
ing rush hour, Joe takes route 2 if he has to make a delivery during this period. 
Therefore, there is a causality relationship between the route chosen and the time 
of the day.
To build and maintain a user model, data about the user’s action must be col-
lected continuously. Data may be collected periodically (e.g., every hour) or when 
a certain event happens (e.g., arrival at a rest area). The frequency of data collection 
depends on the application requirements. The more data is collected about the dif-
ferent variables, the more comprehensive and representative the model will become. 
The data collected is classified into two categories:
	
1.	Environment-specific data describes different aspects of the environment, such 
as weather, traffic conditions, and special events taking place (e.g., certain roads 
are closed tomorrow due to the national day parade rehearsal).
	
2.	User-specific data consists of personal or trip-related information.
The source of data depends on the data being collected; for example, user 
location is collected from a transmitter attached to the vehicle but weather con-
dition is collected from a Web service. The collected data is used to update the 
user model automatically. An approach that can be used to build user models 
is a Bayesian network. In a Bayesian network, nodes are used to represent the 
variables—route, speed, time of the day, and weather conditions. Each node is 
associated with a probability that is calculated based on the user’s history. Refer-
ring to Figure 9.3:
Event: A list of common events that take place in the city.

Time of day: May include rush hour, lunch hour, late night.

N

N

raining.
Route: A list of possible routes between a source and destination.

204  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Speed: All possible speeds.

Knowing the source, destination, and weather conditions enables us to predict 
the most probable speed. This information, together with the last known location, 
allows a prediction of a user’s current or future location.
There are two operations that can be performed on a Bayesian network:
	
1.	Maintain the network, which involves updating the probabilities associated 
with each node based on new observations
	
2.	Perform inferences based on a given observation
The cost of the two operations must be examined to obtain an optimal perfor-
mance. Updating the probabilities frequently will result in better prediction accu-
racy but may incur a high cost in terms of system performance. To lower the cost 
of maintaining the Bayesian network, we can lower the frequency of updates; for 
example, instead of making an update after each trip, the information is stored 
and updated once a week. To control the cost of maintenance and inference, the 
number of possible values at each node must be controlled. For example, instead 
of maintaining probabilities for each weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rain), 
we consider only good and bad weather. Keeping the user model small and simple 
results in easier updates and quicker response.

Location-Aware Application for Medical Workers
Hospital workers are constantly moving to perform their work. The information 
needs of medical workers depend on their locations and contextual conditions. 
Rodríguez et al. (2004) carried out a site study and identified the following infor-
mation and services that are required by medical workers.
Patients’ records, laboratory results, and forms need to be completed. A non-
N
N
electronic method of handling these documents results in inconvenience 
when the documents are misplaced. Moreover, laboratory results may take 
up to eight hours to be delivered to the physician who requested them even 
though the processing of samples is mostly automated and takes only a few 
minutes to perform.
Patients and colleagues need to located. For example, a physician might need 
N
N
to locate a specialist to request an opinion.
Medical equipment, beds, and other devices are moved within the hospital as 
■
■
needed. There has to be a means of tracking and determining the availability 
of a required artifact quickly.
As the information and services required are often location-dependent, a context-
aware hospital information system (HIS) that delivers information according to 
the user’s location was developed after identifying the problems and requirements 
above. Rodríguez et al. (2004) presented the following scenario to illustrate the 
functionality required by the context-aware HIS:
When Dr. Diaz is visiting a patient in bed 248, he realizes that he 
should request a lab test. He uses his PDA to request the test via the 
patient’s electronic clinical record. When the chemist who is respon-
sible for taking samples for the test visits the internal medicine area, his 
PDA informs him that a patient in bed 248 requires a lab test. When 
the chemist is standing at the patient’s bed, his PDA lists the samples he 
must take in order to perform the analysis. After the analysis is done, he 
adds the results to the patient’s record. When Dr. Diaz visits the patient 
in his next round, the result of the analysis is displayed on his PDA. 
Based on the result, he reevaluates the patient and decides to fill in a 
medical note to request the nurse in charge to increase the dose of the 
patient’s medication.
The scenario shows how the system continuously estimates the location of the 
medical workers (in this case, Dr. Diaz and the chemist) to HIS. When they are 
near the patient’s bed, relevant information to their role (a physician or a chemist) 
is displayed. The system is able to determine the identity of Dr Diaz and decides 
which forms to make available to him so that he can request a lab test. The system 

206  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
adapts to the context (in this case, location) of the user. The location-sensing tech-
nique used in this study is a back-propagation neural network that is trained to map 
RF signals from a WLAN to a 2D coordinate.
The location-aware HIS was developed as an agent-based system using a mid-
dleware named SALSA. A SALSA agent consists of three components:
	
1.	A protocol to register the agent with an agent directory.
	
2.	An instant messaging (IM) client. Users, user agents, and device agents inter-
act via the IM client using eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
	
3.	A subsystem that implements the agent’s intelligence consists of a perception 
module, a reasoning module, and an action module. The perception module 
gathers knowledge through the IM client from sensors in the environment, 
other agents, or directly from users or services. The reasoning module deter-
mines an agent’s actions, such as what to perceive next. The action mod-
ule interacts with the environment by sending messages using a predefined 
protocol.
The interface of the application is based on the IM paradigm. Information rel-
evant to the user’s location and role is offered by default, but users can request other 
information by navigation or submitting a query. The handheld computers also 
provide forms that they can complete to communicate with their colleagues. The 
interface also notifies users of the presence and availability of other users and their 
locations. The information received in the handheld is retrieved from HIS. A HIS 
agent acts as a proxy of HIS and provides access to and monitors the state of the 
information in HIS. The architecture of HIS is shown in Figure 9.4.
Referring to the scenario given above, as Dr. Diaz visits his patients, the con-
text-aware client in his PDA communicates with the location-estimation agent 
to update his position. When his location changes, the location-estimation agent 
sends an update of his location via the IM server to all users and agents who have

him registered in their roster. The HIS agent verifies if the contextual conditions 
match the new context (i.e., his role and location) to send him a message that he can 
use to retrieve the patient’s record.
An important issue that is often debated when deploying location-aware appli-
cations is protecting the users’ privacy. In the case of HIS, location estimation is 
performed at the handheld and location information is only shared with other users 
specified by the owner. This approach provides a measure of privacy protection. 
Because locating medical workers over the loudspeaker, by paging, and by sending 
messages to their mobile phone are common practices, the approach adopted by HIS 
does not pose a threat to their privacy. Furthermore, system configuration at the 
server can be done to prevent the sharing of location information when a user is in 
specified areas, such as the bathroom.
9.7	
Summary
There are three methods that can be used to identify the 2D position (latitude and 
longitude) of an object: triangulation, proximity, and scene analysis. A 2D position 
is often sufficient for indoor applications, such as tracking of inventory in a ware-
house or tracking of ME in a plant. On the other hand, a 3D position (latitude, 
longitude, and altitude) would be more helpful when dispatching a search and res-
cue team after receiving a distress call from a mountain climber. A popular means 
of identifying a 3D position is using a satellite service such as GPS.
A positioning system provides the means to determine location and leaves it to 
the user device to calculate its position, whereas a tracking system monitors objects 
without involving them in the computation. A location-sensing system is a hybrid 
of a positioning system and a tracking system.
A location-sensing system offers many advantages. One example is where a 
location system may prove critical in saving a person’s life is the E911 Act, which 
specifies that a when person dials an emergency number, the network should make 
available the caller’s number and location within a 125-m radius. This information 
is valuable for emergency services to locate a caller and dispatch help quickly.
Location systems often raise privacy concerns. For example, when the active 
badge was first introduced at ORL, it was met with great concern. To address 
security concerns, access to location data is restricted to ORL staff members only. 
Users are allowed to specify who can locate them. The management requested that 
all staff members wear the badge for a trial period of two weeks. During the trial 
period, incidence of missed telephone calls dropped substantially. Members of staff 
need not worry that they might miss an important call as calls are forwarded to 
where they are. Clients calling ORL got the impression of an efficient organization 
because the receptionist was able to locate a member of staff with certainty. Their 
receptionist can find a member of staff more quickly and informed visitors where 
they could find a person with greater confidence. Visitors were located easily when 

208  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
they were at ORL, which enhanced security and convenience. After seeing the ben-
efits offered by the system, ORL staff continued wearing the badges after the trial 
period. Experience at ORL indicates that if users’ privacy concerns are addressed 
appropriately and they are allowed to determine who can access their data, users are 
more willing to accept the implementation of a location system such as the active 
badge.

Wireless technologies have become increasingly prevalent in our lives. A PDA allows 
you to access calendar, e-mails, addresses, phone numbers, and the Internet. Some 
services offer GPS capabilities that can pinpoint the location of a device anywhere 
in the world. Wireless technologies promise to offer features and functions that 
are even more advanced in the next few years. The flexibility and cost savings have 
influenced organizations to deploy this technology without realizing that security 
risks in wireless networks are equal to the sum of operating a wired network plus 
the new risks introduced as a result of the portability of wireless devices. Issues such 
as transmission security and authentication are the most likely topics of discus-
sion by security experts. At this point, encryption and authentication protocols are 
available to bring wireless network security to the same high level as that enjoyed 
by wired networks. Methods are available to prevent every known type of attack 
on wireless networks including WLAN detection, eavesdropping, MAC spoofing, 
rogue APs, theft of service, and potential legal issues. The only type of attack that 
can still threaten protected WLANs is one that also remains unresolved for wired 
networks: DoS, which is an attack that prevents legitimate users from accessing 
a network by flooding it with traffic. This chapter discusses security issues and 
threats that have not been covered in previous chapters.
10.1	 Overview of Wireless Security Issues
Even though there are similarities between security issues in wired and wireless 
networks, the problems are aggravated by the fact that transmissions in wireless 

212  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
networks are broadcasted over the air, making them more vulnerable to intercep-
tion and eavesdropping. Due to constraints in bandwidth, memory, and processing 
power of mobile devices, more lightweight solutions are required when addressing 
security concerns in wireless networks. The CPU and the transmitter are two com-
ponents that consume significant amounts of power. Reducing energy consump-
tion requires slower processing speed and processor cycle, thus, imposing a limit on 
the complexity of encryption algorithms that can be executed on a mobile device. 
Security protocols involve the sending and receiving of messages between parties 
that are authenticating each other. Because transmission of data also consumes 
much energy, the number of packets exchanged between the two parties must be 
minimized or optimized.
There are four main security issues in wireless networks (Rahman and Imai 
2002). The first issue is authentication. Mutual authentication is important and 
beneficial for both service providers and users. It protects a service provider from 
unauthorized intrusion and prevents a malicious entity from pretending to be a 
BS. Mutual authentication allows a MS to authenticate a BS and then choose the 
services of a particular BS in the presence of collocated networks.
There are a few issues related to authentication that have not been resolved 
satisfactorily. Because most authentication protocols require that the authentica-
tion server at the user’s home network be contacted for authentication purposes, 
the server has to be available at all times. A part of the transparency requirement 
of an authentication procedure is that the user should not notice a significantly 
longer delay when the authentication takes place in a foreign network. This may 
be difficult to meet as the completion time of the authentication also depends on 
the quality of the link between the visited domain and the mobile user’s home 
authentication server (which might be unpredictable). The reliance on the home 
authentication server may be eliminated by using certificates, but this approach is 
not without its own set of problems.
First, no certification authority is globally accepted and trusted by all entities. 
It is also impractical to assume that mobile users know in advance which certifica-
tion authority is used by the domain they will be visiting. Second, a certificate says 
nothing about the track record of the service provider in the foreign network nor 
of the users. It does not offer complete protection to mobile users from malicious 
entities in a foreign network. Conversely, the certificate says nothing about users’ 
behavior, such as their record in making payments for services rendered, which is 
an important factor if the foreign network is going to charge roaming users for its 
services. Even though it is possible to embed such information in a certificate, it is 
hard to ensure that users cannot modify the information or present only certificates 
that provide favorable credentials. Finally, regardless of whether the authentication 
process is carried out with the users’ home authentication servers or certification 
authorities, the authentication process can be denied to users by cutting off the 
communication channel between clients and the server or by flooding the network 
so that no more bandwidth is available.

Wireless Network Security  213
Even though mutual authentication protects the visited network and the user, it 
is still open to abuse. Users might not misuse services granted to them upon authen-
tication to attack the visited network, but malicious users may connect to other 
organizations for the purposes of launching attacks and concealing their activities. 
To prevent this, a service provider must have a means to detect suspicious activities 
and halt them. Failure to do so might be costly to the service provider’s reputation 
if it is identified to be the source of an attack.
The second issue involves privacy and anonymity. Anonymity involves keeping 
private a user’s real identity, activities, current location, and movement patterns. 
Guaranteeing anonymity is harder in a wireless network because it is more sus-
ceptible to eavesdropping and tapping. Protecting a user’s location and movement 
pattern is important because it may provide an insight to a user’s activity and who 
the user interacts with at a given time. The following precautions were proposed to 
ensure anonymity:
Prevent any association of users with messages sent or received.
N
N
Prevent any association of users with communication sessions that they par-
N
N
ticipate in.
Preserve the privacy of location and movement information of users.
N
N
Prevent the disclosure of the relationships between users and their home 
N
N
domains.
 Prevent any association of users with foreign domains they visited.
N
N
Avoid exposing users’ activities by hiding the relationships between them and 
N
N
visited domains.
Use aliases or nicknames (short- or long-lived) to refer to users without 
N
N
revealing their real identities. A short-lived alias changes each time an inter-
cell or interdomain handoff occurs, whereas a long-lived alias is valid for a 
predefined period.
A DoS involves overwhelming a server with requests to deny legitimate users 
access to data and services offered by the server. It is harder to control visiting hosts 
from overloading the network with excessive transmission, resulting in a sudden 
decrease in network performance, which may lead to a DoS to other mobile hosts. 
A DoS attack is classified as an unselective DoS or a selective DoS. Unselective DoS 
disables the entire or a large part of a network. On the other hand, a selective DoS 
is less evident and its victims are usually well-defined. Ensuring anonymity would 
make selective DoS ineffective.
The third issue is device vulnerability. The portability of mobile devices makes it 
easier for them to be misplaced, lost, or stolen. Even if no confidential data is stored 
on the device, the loss of contact information, for example, can be costly in terms of 
inconvenience and the time a user takes to recover the data. On the other hand, data 
that the user considers unimportant might be valuable to the thief. A mobile device 

214  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
such as an active badge can be used as a control device that gives users access to 
services and information. A thief who can disable the device’s security features will 
have access to information and services that are granted via the device. Passwords 
offer poor protection. One way to overcome this problem is to encrypt data stored 
on devices, such as smart cards, at the expense of battery power and processing 
capability.
The fourth issue is domain crossing. A security domain consists of a set of net-
work entities under one administrative authority employing one security policy. 
When mobile users enter a new domain, they need to authenticate each other to 
ascertain the trustworthiness of one another. The level of trust then determines 
what services and information the new domain wants to offer to the mobile users 
and what activities the mobile users consider safe to carry out while in the domain. 
Another reason why the authentication process is important to a domain is so that 
it can uphold its image as a safe domain. If a domain that sells its services gains a 
reputation of being unsafe, mobile users may choose to steer away from it, possibly 
resulting in lost revenue for the domain.
10.2	 Security of Data Transmission
The objectives of security mechanisms and protocols are to ensure the privacy and 
integrity of data, the authenticity of communicating parties, provide nonrepudia-
tion, prevent DoS attacks, filter viruses and malicious code, and support commu-
nication anonymity. Data transmission security is divided into four domains (Ravi 
et al. 2002):
	
1.	Appliance domain security ensures that only authorized entities can access an 
appliance and modify the data stored on it.
	
2.	Network access domain security ensures that only authorized devices can 
connect to a wireless network and service and guarantee data privacy and 
integrity over the wireless link
	
3.	Network domain security deals with the security of the infrastructure that 
supports a wireless network and may span wired or public networks and may 
be owned by multiple carriers.
	
4.	Application domain security ensures that only safe and trusted applications 
can execute on the appliance, and that transactions between client and server 
applications across the Internet are secure.
Many existing security protocols, such as security protocols defined for WLAN, 
Bluetooth, and GSM, address only the network access domain security (i.e., secur-
ing the link between a wireless client and the AP, BS, or gateway). The protocols 
used in bearer technologies are insufficient for data requiring high level security 
and do not address the problem of maintaining end-to-end security across the 
wired infrastructure network.

Wireless Network Security  215
Addressing security concerns for wireless clients is more challenging due to their 
relatively low processing capability and dependence on battery power. Additionally, 
mobile devices are susceptible to theft, and this is another factor to consider to 
secure data stored on mobile devices. The following challenges must be met when 
securing wireless devices and communications (Ravi et al. 2002):
Security processing gap: Security processing requirements put a very high 
N
N
demand on the limited resources of wireless clients, significantly impairing 
user experience due to poor connection latencies, lower data rates, and shorter 
battery life. As an example, PalmIIIx requires 3.4 min to perform a 512-bit 
RSA key generation and takes 7 s to perform digital signature generation.
Battery gap: The growth of battery capacity at 5–8% a year is much slower 
N
N
than the security processing power requirement. The increase in energy 
requirements of wireless devices is outpacing the growth in battery capacities. 
The addition of security will further widen the battery gap, for example, a 
Sensoria WINS WSN node requires 21.5 mJ to transmit a 1024-bit message, 
but encrypting the same message using RSA requires 42 mJ.
Flexibility: A security protocol standard specifies a wide range of crypto-
N
N
graphic algorithms for a client and server to execute to facilitate interoperabil-
ity. A wireless device often has to execute multiple distinct security protocol 
standards to support security processing at different layers of the network 
protocol stack and for interworking among different networks. Efficiency of 
security processing has to be considered with, and traded off against, the need 
for flexibility. Furthermore, ease of upgrade is desirable to ensure smooth 
upgrades in the future as the security standards evolve.
Tamper-proof implementation: This is important to minimize the security 
N
N
risk if a mobile device physically falls into the hands of a malicious entity. A 
simple password or PIN protection is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized 
access. On the other hand, incorporating biometric techniques introduces a 
set of new challenges, such as how do we integrate a fingerprint scanner to an 
already constrained mobile device.
Ravi et al. (2002) show that there is a wireless security processing gap due to 
a mismatch between wireless security processing requirements and the capabilities 
of processors in mobile devices. They propose the following approaches to bridge 
the gap:
Low complexity security protocols and cryptographic algorithm: To main-
N
N
tain interoperability between wireless devices and their wired peers, many 
existing wired protocols need to be supported on the wireless device. The 
security processing workload on a mobile client can be reduced by carefully 
selecting and implementing only a subset of a protocol’s features. A security 

216  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
protocol can be made to adapt its encryption policy based on the type of data 
being encrypted. For example, a video encryption algorithm protects only the 
more important parts of a video stream instead of the entire stream to reduce 
the amount of data encrypted. The use of lightweight algorithms would also 
contribute to reducing the demand on processor capability. The ECC is an 
example of a public-key cryptosystem that provides a high level of security 
and is less demanding on computing and memory resources.
Embedded processors with enhanced security processing capabilities: These 
N
N
involve adding cryptographic accelerators to the basic processing core by accel-
erating bit-level arithmetic operations for permutations performed using Data 
Encryption Standard (DES) or 3DES. Another approach is using instruction 
set extensions for substitutions, rotations, and modular arithmetic operations 
that are used in private-key algorithms.
MObile SEcurity processing System (MOSES): A programmable security 
N
N
processor platform developed at NEC to secure data and multimedia com-
munications in next-generation wireless devices. Its objective is to address the 
wireless security processing gap and to support a wide range of current and 
future security protocol standards. The MOSES system architecture consists 
of layered, optimized software libraries that implement the cryptographic 
algorithm and a state-of-the-art configurable and extensible processor that is 
customized for efficient security processing.
10.3	 Next-Generation Hackers
Virus, worm, and Trojan attacks are classified under malware threats. Mobile 
phones have evolved to become sophisticated full-scale Internet-enabled comput-
ers. In the next few years, attacks on mobile phones and devices will become similar 
to the ones on PCs. Dagon et al. (2004) introduce a taxonomy of mobile malware 
based on the type of security that attackers aim to compromise (Table 10.1). There 
are three types of attacks: confidentiality, integrity, and availability attacks.
Information theft can be classified into two categories (Dagon et al. 2004): tran-
sient information and static information. Examples of transient information are the 
phone’s location, its power usage, and other data the device does not record. A user’s 
movement can be tracked using the E911 service. Static information is information 
that mobile devices store and transmit over the network, such as phone numbers 
and programs stored on the device. Bluesnarfing is an attack that targets static infor-
mation. It gives hackers access to data stored on a Bluetooth-enabled phone using 
Bluetooth wireless technology without alerting the phone’s owner of the connection 
made to the device. The hacker would be able to access the owner’s phonebook, 
images, calendar, and IMEI. This attack can be prevented by setting the device to 
nondiscoverable mode.

Wireless Network Security  217
Bluebugging is an attack that gives the hacker access to mobile phone com-
mands using Bluetooth wireless technology without notifying or alerting the 
phone’s owner. This vulnerability allows the hacker to initiate phone calls, send 
and read SMS, read and write phonebook contacts, eavesdrop on phone conversa-
tions, and connect to the Internet. Most people believe that because Bluetooth is a 
short-range communication standard, threats to mobile phones are minimal as the 
attackers have to be physically near their victims, but it has been shown that it is 
possible to establish a Bluetooth connection with a standard mobile phone almost 
2 km away using a 19-dbi (decibels relative to isotropic radiator) panel antenna (G4 
Media Inc. Web site). Bluebugging gives the attacker access to the victim’s phone 
and turns it into a listening device. The attacker can call the victim’s device without 
ringing it and the phone automatically answers. The attacker turns the victim’s 
phone into a bugging device and eavesdrops on the owner’s conversation. Phone 
jacking is a malware that allows an attacker to use the victim’s phone resources to 
place long distance call and send expensive MMS messages.
There are two types of DoS attacks. The first type tries to flood the device, and 
the other one tries to drain the battery. Open-source Bluetooth stacks are vulner-
able to simple protocol attacks such as repeated sending of packets and sending 
incorrect packet formats. The battery is drained by preventing it from going into 
PSM. This means that a mobile phone’s battery would only last as long as the 
talk time even if the user is not using the phone. If the battery-draining malware 
could spread quickly from one mobile phone to another, the attacker could disrupt 
mobile phone service on a large scale.
Security researchers have identified a number of ways hackers can infect mobile 
phones with malware (Leavitt 2005). Smart phones are most susceptible to mal-
ware threats because they provide users with Internet connectivity that allows users 
to download applications and files that may contain malicious code. Consider-
ing that an estimated 130 million smart phones will be sold by 2008, the scale 
of damage that can be done by the next-generation hackers may potentially be 
devastating. Amateur virus writers may cause minor nuisances such as deleting 
a victim’s personal data, but professional hackers might do more serious damage,

218  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
for example, create an attack that degrades or overloads mobile networks. Further-
more, as m-commerce gains acceptance and malware becomes more sophisticated, 
an attacker would be able to steal financial data, such as a credit card number stored 
on the phone. Viruses can allow an attacker access to passwords and corporate data 
stored on the phone. The victim’s phone can also be manipulated to make calls and 
send messages, running up the victim’s phone bill. This attack is termed theft of 
service. The first mobile virus was found in 2000 and about 31 viruses have been 
detected by 2005. Table 10.2 lists a few of the identified mobile malicious codes.
SMS with its limit on 168 characters is not useful as a means to spread viruses 
but can be used to generate a huge amount of SMS traffic that could overwhelm the 
network or incur high bills for the victims. Future viruses are likely to be spread by 
MMS. A MMS that can carry up to 150 kbps of data is large enough to be a means 
to spread viruses. Even though many mobile phones now support e-mail applica-
tions, it is unlikely to become a means to transmit mobile viruses as users rarely use 
their phones exclusively to read e-mails. Virus writers prefer to send malicious code 
using approaches primarily used by mobile phones. Therefore, as the popularity of 
mobile IM grows, attacks similar to the one seen on desktops, such as hijacking an 
IM name list, are likely to increase. Another means of transmitting mobile code is 
placing infected mobile games on the Internet for downloading.
10.4	 Summary
The security risks in wireless networks are equal to the sum of risks when operat-
ing a wired network plus the risks imposed by the vulnerability of wireless net-
works and the portability of mobile devices. The security threats are exacerbated 
due to the vulnerability of transmitting data over the air. As technology progresses, 
we will see more desktop-like applications and services offered to mobile users. 
Some of these services and applications may require the transmission of confiden-
tial or sensitive data, such as a credit card number or a patient’s medical data. 
Encryption of such data proves to be a delicate balancing act between meeting the 
demand of a processor-intensive encryption algorithm and conserving power on a 
­resource-­constrained mobile device.
The provision of a seamless service to users as they roam between domains is a 
desirable aspect of mobile service but brings its own set of security challenges. Mutual 
authentication is a must to protect both users and service providers from malicious enti-
ties. Upon authentication, a user is assigned a trust level that determines the types of 
services and resources that the user can access.
Location tracking is necessary to provide services and context-relevant infor-
mation to mobile users. Because the location-tracking information can easily be 
misused to track a user’s habits and activities, it is imperative that procedures and 
policies are in place to protect users’ privacy and anonymity.

Attack
Cabir
Worm
A shared infected application, 
Bluetooth link. 
The worm arrives as a .SIS (Symbian installation system) application 
installation file. The victim’s device asks if the user wants to receive a 
message via Bluetooth. If the user chooses to receive the file, it installs 
and sends itself to another Bluetooth-enabled device. It forces the device 
to constantly scan for other Bluetooth-enabled devices, reduces battery 
lifetime, and degrades Bluetooth performance. This attack can be 
prevented by turning off the Bluetooth setting on the phone.
Skulls
Trojan 
horse
Hackers upload Skull to shareware 
sites where it is downloaded by 
users. It appears as a useful 
application that lets users preview, 
select, and remove design themes on 
their hand phones. 
It disables Symbian applications by replacing the original binaries, such as 
functions for file management, messaging, and Web browsing, with 
nonfunctional binaries. As a result, the phone can only be used to make 
and receive calls. It replaces application icons with a skull and 
crossbones.
Mquito
Worm
Downloaded file.
It is a version of the Mosquito game whose copy protection has been 
cracked. When the game is installed, it sends unauthorized SMS text 
messages to high-cost toll phone numbers in Germany, Holland, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Windows 
CE Virus
Virus
It spreads by file exchange or 
transfer. The virus sends a message 
asking for permission to download. 
If the victim allows the download, the virus infects all executable files 
bigger than 4 KB by appending itself to the file. When the victim tries to 
execute the file, the virus runs, but not the application. This virus was 
written as a proof-of-concept for Microsoft mobile operating system.
Metal 
Gear
Trojan 
horse
The Trojan horse is camouflaged as a 
Metal Gear Solid video game. It 
spreads when a victim opens and 
installs a fake Metal Gear game.
It disables antivirus programs and installs the Cabir.G worm that tries to 
spread another Trojan, SEXXXY, to nearby phones via Bluetooth links. It 
disables all tools on the phone that are needed to undo the damage 
done.
Gavno
Trojan 
horse
It contains an application file that 
has been rendered invalid by 
hackers.
When the Symbian operating system tries to use the file, it causes a series 
of cascading errors, making the operating system unstable. The infected 
phone can only receive calls. Gavno makes the phone reboot, producing 
similar errors.

220  Principles of Mobile Computing and Communications
Users can protect themselves from malware threats by following the simple 
guidelines that protect them when on the wired networks, such as not download-
ing files distributed at Web sites and not opening file attachments. Attacks that 
manipulate Bluetooth security vulnerabilities can easily be avoided by setting the 
device to nondiscoverable mode.
