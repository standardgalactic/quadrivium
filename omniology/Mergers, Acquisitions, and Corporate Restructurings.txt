Preface
T
he field of mergers and acquisitions has undergone tumultuous changes over the
past four decades. The fourth merger wave of the 1980s featured a fascinating
period of many hostile deals and leveraged buyouts along with many more “plain
vanilla” deals. The 1990s witnessed the fifth merger wave—a merger wave that was
truly international in scope. After a brief recessionary lull, the merger frenzy began once
againandglobalmegamergersbegantofillthecorporatelandscape.Thiswasderailedby
the subprime crisis and the Great Recession. When the economic recovery was initially
slow, so too wastherebound inM&A activity. However, by 2013and 2014, M&A volume
rebounded strongly and has continued in the years that followed.
Over the past quarter of a century, we have noticed that merger waves have become
more frequent. The time periods between waves also has shrunken. When these trends
are combined with the fact that M&A has rapidly spread across the modern world, we
see that the field is increasingly becoming an ever more important part of the worlds of
corporate finance and corporate strategy.
As the field has evolved we see that many of the methods that applied to deals of
prior years are still relevant, but new techniques and rules are also in effect. These new
methods and techniques consider the mistakes of prior periods along with the current
economic and financial conditions. Participants in M&As tend to be an optimistic lot and
often focus on the upside of deals while avoiding important issues that can derail a trans-
action. There are many great lessons that can be learned from the large history of M&As
thatisavailable.Whatisinterestingisthat,aswithmanyotherareasoffinance,learning
from past mistakes proves challenging. Lessons that are learned tend to be short-lived.
For example, the failures of the fourth merger wave of the 1980s were so pronounced
that corporate decision makers loudly proclaimed that they would never enter into such
foolish transactions. However, there is nothing like a stock market boom to render past
lessons difficult to recall while bathing in the euphoria of rising equity values.
The focus of this book is decidedly pragmatic. We have attempted to write it in a
manner that will be useful to both the business student and the practitioner. Since the
world of M&A is clearly interdisciplinary, material from the fields of law and economics
is presented along with corporate finance, which is the primary emphasis of the book.
The practical skills of finance practitioners have beenintegrated with the research of the
academic world of finance. In addition, we have an expanded chapter devoted to the val-
uation of businesses, including the valuation of privately held firms. This is an important
topic that tends not to receive the attention it needs, as a proper valuation can be the

Preface
key between a successful and a failed transaction. Much of the finance literature tends
to be divided into two camps: practitioners and academicians. Clearly, both groups have
madevaluablecontributionstothefieldofM&As.Thisbookattemptstointerweavethese
contributions into one comprehensible format.
The increase in M&A activity has given rise to the growth of academic research in
this area. In fact, M&A seems to generate more research than other areas of finance.
This book attempts to synthesize some of the more important and relevant research
studies and to present their results in a straightforward and pragmatic manner. Because
of the voluminous research in the field, only the findings of the more important studies
are highlighted. Issues such as shareholder wealth effects of antitakeover measures
have important meanings to investors, who are concerned about how the defensive
actions of corporations will affect the value of their investments. This is a good example
of how the academic research literature has made important pragmatic contributions
that have served to shed light on important policy issues. It is unfortunate that
corporate decision makers are not sufficiently aware of the large body of pragmatic,
high-quality research that exists in the field of M&A. It is amazing that senior managers
and the boards regularly approve deals or take other actions in supporting or opposing
a transaction without any knowledge on the voluminous body of high-quality research
on the effects of such actions. One of the contributions we seek to make with this book
is to render this body of pragmatic research readily available, understandable, and
concisely presented. It is hoped, then, that practitioners can use it to learn the impacts
of the deals of prior decision makers.
We have avoided incorporating theoretical research that has less relevance to those
seeking a pragmatic treatment of M&As. However, in general, much of M&A research
has a pragmatic focus. For decision makers, this research contains a goldmine of knowl-
edge. The peer-reviewed research process has worked to produce a large volume of qual-
ity studies that can be invaluable to practitioners who will access it. We have endeavored
to integrate the large volume of ongoing research into an expansive treatment of the
field. The rapidly evolving nature of M&As requires constant updating. Every effort has
been made to include recent developments occurring just before the publication date.
We wish the reader an enjoyable and profitable trip through the world of M&As.

CHAPTER ONE
Introduction
RECENT M&A TRENDS
The pace of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) picked up in the early 2000s after
collapsing in the wake of the subprime crisis. M&A volume was quite strong over the
period 2003–2007. This strength was apparent globally, not just in the United States.
However, the United States entered the Great Recession in 2008 and the recovery from
this strong economic downturn would prove difficult. A number of deals that were
planned in 2007 were canceled.
Figure 1.1 shows that the aforementioned strong M&A volume over the years 2003
to 2007 occurred in both Europe and the United States. M&A volume began to rise in
2003 and by 2006–2007 had reached levels comparable to their peaks of the fifth wave.
With such high deal volume, huge megamergers were not unusual (see Tables 1.1 and
1.2). In the United States, M&A dollar volume peaked in 2007, whereas in Europe, this
market peaked in 2006. Fueled by some inertia, the value of total M&A was surprisingly
strong in 2008 when one considers that we were in the midst of the Great Recession.
The lagged effect of the downturn, however, was markedly apparent in 2009 when M&A
volume collapsed.
The rebound in U.S. M&A started in 2010 and became quite strong in 2011, only to
weaken temporarily in 2012 before resuming in 2013. The U.S. M&A market was very
strong in 2014, and in 2015 it hit an all-time record, although, on an inflation-adjusted
basis, 2000 was the strongest M&A year. In 2016, the M&A market was still strong in
the United States, although somewhat weaker than 2015.
The story was quite different in Europe. After hitting an all-time peak in 2006 (it
should be noted, though, that on an inflation-adjusted basis, 1999 was the all-time

peak in M&A for Europe), the market weakened a little in 2007 and 2008, although
it was still relatively strong. However, Europe’s M&A business shrank dramatically in
2009 and 2010 as Europe was affected by the U.S. Great Recession and also its financial
system also suffered from some of the same subprime-related issues that affected the U.S.
financial system.
The M&A business rebounded well in 2011, only to be somewhat blunted by a
double-dip recession in Europe, which was partly caused by the European sovereign
debt problems. The Eurozone had a 15-month recession from the second quarter of
2008 into the second quarter of 2009, but then had two more downturns from the
fourth quarter of 2011 into the second quarter of 2012 (9 months) and again from
the fourth quarter of 2012 into the first quarter of 2013 (18 months). M&A volume
was more robust in 2015 and 2016 but unlike in the United States, Europe remained
well below the level that was set in 2006.

Deal volume in most regions of the world generally tends to follow the patterns in
the United States and Europe (see Figure 1.2). Australia, for example, exhibits such a
pattern, with deal volume growth starting in 2003 but falling off in 2008 and 2009 for
the same reason it fell off in the United States and Europe. Australian deals rebounded
in 2013 and have grown since except for a modest decline in 2016.

these economies has traditionally been well below the United States and Europe but had
been steadily growing even in 2008, only to fall off sharply in 2009. China’s economy
has realized double-digit growth for a number of years and is now more than one-half of
the size of the U.S. economy (although on a purchasing power parity basis it is approxi-
mately the same size). Economic growth slowed in recent years from double-digit levels
to just under 7% per year even with significant government efforts to try to return to
prior growth levels.

There are many regulatory restrictions imposed on M&As in China that inhibit deal
volumefromrisingtolevelsthatwouldnaturallyoccurinaless-controlledenvironment.
The Chinese regulatory authorities have taken measures to ensure that Chinese con-
trol of certain industries and companies is maintained even as the economy moves to a
more free market status. This is why many of the larger Asian deals find their origins in
Hong Kong (see Table 1.3). Nonetheless, the M&A business in China over the past few
years has been at its highest levels. While Chinese demand for foreign targets rose to
impressive heights in 2016, in the second half of 2016 and 2017 the Chinese govern-
ment took measures to limit capital from leaving China—something that is necessary
to complete most foreign deals. Financing for such deals became more difficult, and the
Chinese Commerce Ministry began taking a hard line on some large deals.
In Hong Kong, the number of deals has been rising over the past three years and the
outlook remains positive. The same is true of Taiwan and South Korea.
TheM&A businesshasbeenincreasing inIndia, asthat nation’seconomy continues
to grow under the leadership of its very probusiness Prime Minister Modi. The demo-
graphics of the Indian economy imply future economic growth, and are the opposite of
Japan. This helps explain why the Japanese economy has been in the doldrums for the
past couple of decades. Since 2011, M&A volume in Japan has been steady, but without
major growth or a return to the pre-subprime crisis days.
VODAFONE TAKEOVER OF MANNESMANN:
LARGEST TAKEOVER IN HISTORY
V
odafone Air Touch’s takeover of Mannesmann, both telecom companies (and
actually alliance partners), is noteworthy for several reasons in addition to the
fact that it is the largest deal of all time (see Table 1.1). Vodafone was one of the
world’s largest mobile phone companies and grew signiﬁcantly when it acquired Air
Touch in 1999. This largest deal was an unsolicited hostile bid by a British company
of a German ﬁrm. The takeover shocked the German corporate world because
it was the ﬁrst time a large German company had been taken over by a foreign
company—and especially in this case, as the foreign company was housed in Britain
and the two countries had fought two world wars against each other earlier in
the century. Mannesmann was a large company with over 100,000 employees and
had been in existence for over 100 years. It was originally a company that made
seamless tubes, but over the years had diversiﬁed into industries such as coal and
steel. In its most recent history, it had invested heavily in the telecommunications
industry. Thus, it was deeply engrained in the fabric of the German corporate world
and economy.
It is ironic that Vodafone became more interested in Mannesmann after the
latter took over British mobile phone operator Orange PLC. This came as a surprise
to Vodafone, as Orange was Vodafone’s rival, being the third-largest mobile operator
in Great Britain. It was also a surprise as Vodafone assumed that Mannesmann would
pursue alliances with Vodafone, not move into direct competition with it by acquiring
one of its leading rivals.a
Mannesmann tried to resist the Vodafone takeover, but the board ultimately
agreed to the generous price paid. The Mannesmann board tried to get Vodafone

◾
Introduction
(continued )
to agree to maintain the Mannesmann name after the completion of the deal. It
appeared that Vodafone would do so, but eventually they chose to go with the
Vodafone name—something that made good sense in this age of globalization, as
maintaining multiple names would inhibit common marketing efforts.
Up until the mid-1990s, Germany, like many European nations, had a limited
market for corporate control. The country was characterized as having corporate
governance institutions, which made hostile takeovers difﬁcult to complete. How-
ever, a number of factors began to change, starting in the second half of the 1990s
and continuing through the 2000s. First, the concentration of shares in the hands of
parties such as banks, insurance companies, and governmental entities, which were
reluctant to sell to hostile bidders, began to decline. In turn, the percentage of
shares in the hands of more ﬁnancially oriented parties, such as money managers,
began to rise. Another factor that played a role in facilitating hostile deals is that
banks had often played a defensive role for target management. They often held
shares in the target and even maintained seats on the target’s board and opposed
hostile bidders while supporting management. One of the ﬁrst signs of this change
was apparent when WestLB bank supported Krupp in its takeover of Hoesch in 1991.
In the case of Mannesmann, Deutsche Bank, which had been the company’s bank
since the late 1800s,b had a representative on Mannesmann’s board but he played
no meaningful role in resisting Vodafone’s bid. Other parties who often played a
defensive role, such as representatives of labor, who often sit on boards based on
what is known as codetermination policy, also played little role in this takeover.
The position of target shareholders is key in Germany, as antitakeover measures
such as poison pills (to be discussed at length in Chapter 5) are not as effective
due to Germany’s corporate law and the European Union (EU) Takeover Directive,
which requires equal treatment of all shareholders. However, German takeover law
includes exceptions to the strict neutrality provisions of the Takeover Directive,
which gives the target’s board more ﬂexibility in taking defensive measures.
It is ironic that Vodafone was able to take over Mannesmann, as the latter
was much larger than Vodafone in terms of total employment and revenues. How-
ever, the market, which was at that time assigning unrealistic values to telecom
companies, valued Mannesmann in 1999 at a price/book ratio of 10.2 (from 1.4
in 1992) while Vodafone had a price/book ratio of 125.5 in 1999 (up from 7.7 in
1992).c This high valuation gave Vodafone “strong currency” with which to make a
stock-for-stock bid that was difﬁcult for Mannesmann to resist.
The takeover of Mannesmann was a shock to the German corporate world.
Parties that were passive began to become more active in response to a popular
outcry against any further takeover of German corporations. It was a key factor in
steeling the German opposition to the EU Takeover Directive, which would have
made such takeovers easier.

Securities Data, January 12, 2017.
The total volume of deals in South and Central America (see Figure 1.3 and
Table 1.4) is small compared to the United States and Europe. South America has been
relatively weak in recent years. Argentina has experienced years of economic problems
and only now has a pro-business president, Mauricio Macri, who faces major challenges
trying to undo the effects of years of poorly thought out economic policies. Brazil, once
the powerhouse of South American M&A, has been rocked by a recessionary economy
that has been badly hurt by falling commodity prices and political scandals.
In considering the combined Central America and Mexico market, the larger deals
are attributable to Mexico. Mexico had been undergoing something of an economic
resurgence with annual growth as high as 5.1% in 2010. This growth had been
boosted by recent attempts to deregulate major industries, such as petroleum and
telecommunications, while fostering greater competition. Factors such as falling
commodity prices have slowed Mexican economic growth to a little over 2%. This has
contributed to weak M&A volume in the combined Mexico/Central America region.
TERMINOLOGY
A merger differs from a consolidation, which is a business combination whereby two or
more companies join to form an entirely new company. All of the combining companies
are dissolved and only the new entity continues to operate. One classic example of a con-
solidation occurred in 1986 when the computer manufacturers Burroughs and Sperry
combined to form Unisys. A more recent example of a consolidation occurred in 2014
when Kinder Morgan consolidated its large oil and gas empire. It had Kinder Morgan,

Types of Mergers

Inc., acquire Kinder Morgan Energy Part LP, Kinder Morgan Management LLC, and El
Paso Pipeline Partners LP. The acquired entities were master limited partnerships that
provided certain tax benefits but that limited the ability of the overall business to grow
and do larger M&As.
In a consolidation, the original companies cease to exist and their stockholders
become stockholders in the new company. One way to look at the differences between
a merger and a consolidation is that with a merger, A + B = A, where company B is
merged into company A. In a consolidation, A + B = C, where C is an entirely new
company. Despite the differences between them, the terms merger and consolidation,
as is true of many of the terms in the M&A field, are sometimes used interchangeably.
In general, when the combining firms are approximately the same size, the term
consolidation applies; when the two firms differ significantly in size, merger is the more
appropriate term. In practice, however, this distinction is often blurred, with the term
merger being broadly applied to combinations that involve firms of both different and
similar sizes.
VALUING A TRANSACTION
Throughout this book, we cite various merger statistics on deal values. The method used
by Mergerstat is the most common method relied on to value deals. Enterprise value is
defined as the base equity price plus the value of the target’s debt (including both short-
and long-term) and preferred stock less its cash. The base equity price is the total price
less the value of the debt. The buyer is defined as the company with the larger market
capitalization or the company that is issuing shares to exchange for the other company’s
shares in a stock-for-stock transaction.
TYPES OF MERGERS
Mergers are often categorized as horizontal, vertical, or conglomerate. A horizontal
merger occurs when two competitors combine. For example, in 1998, two petroleum
companies, Exxon and Mobil, combined in a $78.9 billion megamerger. Another
example was the 2009 megamerger that occurred when Pfizer acquired Wyeth for
$68 billion. If a horizontal merger causes the combined firm to experience an increase
in market power that will have anticompetitive effects, the merger may be opposed
on antitrust grounds. In recent years, however, the U.S. government has been some-
what liberal in allowing many horizontal mergers to go unopposed. In Europe, the
European Commission has traditionally been somewhat cautious when encountering
mergers that may have anticompetitive effects or that may create strong competitors of
European companies.
Vertical mergers are combinations of companies that have a buyer-seller rela-
tionship. A good example is the U.S. eyeglasses industry. One company, an Italian
manufacturer, Luxottica, expanded into the U.S. market through a series of acquisitions.
It was able to acquire retailers such as LensCrafters and Sunglasses Hut, as well as
major brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley. It is surprising to some that the company

14
◾
Introduction
was allowed by regulators to assume the large vertical position it enjoys in the U.S.
eyeglasses market.1 In 2017, Luxottica announced it planned to merge (pending
global antitrust approval) with the French lens company Essilor, creating a $49 billion
company in terms of market value.
A conglomerate merger occurs when the companies are not competitors and
do not have a buyer–seller relationship. One example was Philip Morris, a tobacco
company, which acquired General Foods in 1985 for $5.6 billion, Kraft in 1988 for
$13.44 billion, and Nabisco in 2000 for $18.9 billion. Interestingly, Philip Morris,
which later changed its name to Altria, had used the cash flows from its food and
tobacco businesses to become less of a domestic tobacco company and more of a food
business. This is because the U.S. tobacco industry has been declining, although the
international tobacco business has not been experiencing such a decline. The company
eventually concluded that the litigation problems of its U.S. tobacco unit, Philip Morris
USA, were a drag on the stock price of the overall corporation and disassembled the
conglomerate. The aforementioned megamergers by Philip Morris/Altria were later
undone in a serious of selloffs.
Another major example of a conglomerate is General Electric (GE). This company
has done what many others have not been able to do successfully—manage a diverse
portfolio of companies in a way that creates shareholder wealth (most of the time). GE is
a serial acquirer, and a highly successful one at that. As we will discuss in Chapter 4, the
track record of diversifying and conglomerate acquisitions is not good. We will explore
why a few companies have been able to do this while many others have not.
In recent years the appearances of conglomerates have changed. We now have
“new-economy” conglomerates, such as Alphabet, the parent company of Google,
Amazon, and perhaps even Facebook. These companies grew from one main line of
business that generated significant cash flows that enabled them to branch out into
other fields through M&As. For example, Alphabet/Google controls Android, YouTube,
and Waze. Facebook acquired Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus. Amazon acquired
Zappos.com, Kiva Systems, Twitch, and in 2017, Whole Foods. These companies
look different from the conglomerates of old but they also have many characteristics
in common.
MERGER CONSIDERATION
Mergers may be paid for in several ways. Transactions may use all cash, all securities,
or a combination of cash and securities. Securities transactions may use the stock of
the acquirer as well as other securities, such as debentures. The stock may be either
common stock or preferred stock. They may be registered, meaning they are able to be
freely traded on organized exchanges, or they may be restricted, meaning they cannot
be offered for public sale, although private transactions among a limited number of buy-
ers, such as institutional investors, are permissible.

Merger Professionals

If a bidder offers its stock in exchange for the target’s shares, this offer may provide
for either a fixed or floating exchange ratio. When the exchange ratio is floating, the bid-
der offers a dollar value of shares as opposed to a specific number of shares. The number
of shares that is eventually purchased by the bidder is determined by dividing the value
offeredbythebidder’saveragestockpriceduringaprespecifiedperiod.Thisperiod,called
the pricing period, is usually some months after the deal is announced and before the clos-
ing of the transaction. The offer could also be defined in terms of a collar, which provides
for a maximum and minimum number of shares within the floating value agreement.
Stock transactions may offer the seller certain tax benefits that cash transactions
do not provide. However, securities transactions require the parties to agree on not only
the value of the securities purchased but also the value of those that are used for pay-
ment. This may create some uncertainty and may give cash an advantage over securities
transactions from the seller’s point of view. For large deals, all-cash compensation may
mean that the bidder has to incur debt, which may carry with it unwanted, adverse risk
consequences.
Merger agreements can have fixed compensation or they can allow for variable
payments to the target. It is common in deals between smaller companies, or when
a larger company acquires a smaller target, that the payment includes a contingent
component. Such payments may include an “earn out” where part of the payments is
based on the performance of the target. A related concept is contingent value rights
(CVRs). CVRs guarantee some future value based on the occurrence of some events
such as a sales target. An example of their use was pharmaceutical firm Allergan’s
2016 acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics, where Allergan paid $28.35 for each share of
Tobira but also gave CVRs that could equal up to $49.84 based on certain regulatory
and business achievements.
Sometimes merger agreements include a holdback provision. While alternatives
vary, such provisions in the merger agreement provide for some of the compensation to
be withheld based upon the occurrence of certain events. For example, the buyer may
deposit some of the compensation in an escrow account. If litigation or other specific
adverse events occur, the payments may be returned to the buyer. If the events do not
occur, the payments are released to the selling shareholders after a specific time period.
MERGER PROFESSIONALS
When a company decides it wants to acquire or merge with another firm, it typically
does so using the services of attorneys, accountants, and valuation experts. For smaller
deals involving closely held companies, the selling firm may employ a business broker
who may represent the seller in marketing the company. In larger deals involving
publicly held companies, the sellers and the buyers may employ investment bankers.
Investment bankers may provide a variety of services, including helping to select the
appropriate target, valuing the target, advising on strategy, and raising the requisite
financing to complete the transaction. Table 1.5 is a list of leading investment bankers
and advisors.

Investment Bankers
The work that investment bankers do for clients is somewhat different, based on whether
they are on the sell side or the buy side of a transaction. On the buy side, they can assist
theirclientsindevelopingaproposalthat,inturn,contemplatesaspecificdealstructure.
They may handle initial communications with the seller and/or its representatives. In
addition, they do due diligence and valuation so that they have a good sense of what the
market value of the business is. Investment bankers may have done some of this work in
advance if they happened to bring the deal to the buyer.
On the sell side, investment bankers consult with the client and may develop
an acquisition memorandum that may be distributed to qualified potential buyers.
The banker screens potential buyers so as to deal only with those who both are truly
interested and have the capability of completing a deal. Typically, those who qualify
then have to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to gaining access to key financial
information about the seller. We will discuss such agreements a little later in this
chapter. Once the field has been narrowed, the administrative details have to be worked
out for who has access to the “data room” so the potential buyers can conduct their due
diligence.
The investment banker often will handle communications with buyers and their
investment bankers as buyers formulate offers. The bankers work with the seller to eval-
uate these proposals and select the most advantageous one.
Legal M&A Advisors
Given the complex legal environment that surrounds M&As, attorneys also play a key
role in a successful acquisition process. Law firms may be even more important in hos-
tile takeovers than in friendly acquisitions because part of the resistance of the target
may come through legal maneuvering. Detailed filings with the Securities and Exchange

Commission (SEC) may need to be completed under the guidance of legal experts. In both
private and public M&As, there is a legal due diligence process that attorneys should be
retained to perform. Table 1.6 shows the leading legal M&A advisors. Accountants also
play an important role in M&As by conducting the accounting due diligence process.
In addition, accountants perform various other functions, such as preparing pro forma
financial statements based on scenarios put forward by management or other profes-
sionals. Still another group of professionals who provide important services in M&As
are valuation experts. These individuals may be retained by either a bidder or a target
to determine the value of a company. We will see in Chapter 14 that these values may
vary, depending on the assumptions employed. Therefore, valuation experts may build
a model that incorporates various assumptions, such as different revenue growth rates
or costs, which may be eliminated after the deal. As these and other assumptions vary,
the resulting value derived from the deal also may change.
AVIS: A VERY ACQUIRED COMPANY
S
ometimes companies become targets of an M&A bid because the target seeks
a company that is a good strategic ﬁt. Other times the seller or its investment
banker very effectively shops the company to buyers who did not necessarily have
the target, or even a company like the target, in their plans. This is the history of
the often-acquired rent-a-car company, Avis.
Avis was founded by Warren Avis in 1946. In 1962, the company was acquired
by the M&A boutique investment bank Lazard Freres. Lazard then began a process
where it sold and resold the company to multiple buyers. In 1965, it sold Avis to its
(continued )

(continued )
conglomerate client ITT. When the conglomerate era came to an end, ITT sold Avis
off to another conglomerate, Norton Simon. That company was then acquired by
still another conglomerate, Esmark, which included different units, such as Swift &
Co. Esmark was then taken over by Beatrice, which, in 1986, became a target of a
leveraged buyout (LBO) by Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts (KKR).
KKR, burdened with LBO debt, then sold off Avis to Wesray, which was an
investment ﬁrm that did some very successful private equity deals. Like the private
equity ﬁrms of today, Wesray would acquire attractively priced targets and then sell
them off for a proﬁt—often shortly thereafter.
This deal was no exception. Wesray sold Avis to an employee stock ownership
plan (ESOP) owned by the rent-a-car company’s employees at a high proﬁt just a
little over a year after it took control of the company.
At one point, General Motors (GM) took a stake in the company: For a period
of time, the major auto companies thought it was a good idea to vertically integrate
by buying a car rental company. The combined employee-GM ownership lasted for
about nine years until 1996, when the employees sold the company to HFS. Senior
managers of Avis received in excess of $1 million each while the average employee
received just under $30,000. One year later, HFS took Avis public. However, Cendant,
a company that was formed with the merger of HFS and CUC, initially owned
one-third of Avis. It later acquired the remaining two-thirds of the company. Avis
was then a subsidiary within Cendant—part of the Avis Budget group, as Cendant
also had acquired Budget Rent A Car. Cendant was a diversiﬁed company that
owned many other subsidiaries, such as Century 21 Real Estate, Howard Johnson,
Super 8 Motels, and Coldwell Banker. The market began to question the wisdom
of having all of these separate entities within one corporate umbrella without any
good synergistic reasons for their being together. In 2006, Cendant did what many
diversiﬁed companies do when the market lowers its stock valuation and, in effect,
it does not like the conglomerate structure—it broke the company up, in this case,
into four units.
The Avis Budget Group began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in
2006 as CAR. Avis’s curious life as a company that has been regularly bought and
sold underscores the great ability of investment bankers to sell the company and
thereby generate fees for their services. However, despite its continuous changing
of owners, the company still thrives in the marketplace.
MERGER ARBITRAGE
Another group of professionals who can play an important role in takeovers is
arbitragers. Generally, arbitrage refers to the buying of an asset in one market and sell-
ing it in another. Risk arbitragers look for price discrepancies between different markets
for the same assets and seek to sell in the higher-priced market and buy in the lower
one. Practitioners of these kinds of transactions try to do them simultaneously, thus
locking in their gains without risk. With respect to M&A, arbitragers purchase stock of
companies that may be taken over in the hope of getting a takeover premium when the

deal closes. This is referred to as risk arbitrage, as purchasers of shares of targets cannot
be certain the deal will be completed. They have evaluated the probability of completion
and pursue deals with a sufficiently high probability.
The merger arbitrage business is fraught with risks. When markets turn down and
the economy slows, deals are often canceled. This occurred in the late 1980s, when the
stock market crashed in 1987 and the junk bond market declined dramatically. The junk
bond market was the fuel for many of the debt-laden deals of that period. In addition,
when merger waves end, deal volume dries up, lowering the total business available.
It occurred again in 2007–2009, when the subprime crisis reduced credit avail-
ability to finance deals and also made bidders reconsider the prices they offered for
target shares.
In general, the arbitrage business has expanded over the past decade. Several active
funds specialize in merger arbitrage. These funds may bet on many deals at the same
time. They usually purchase the shares after a public announcement of the offer has
been made. Under certain market conditions, shares in these funds can be an attractive
investment because their returns may not be as closely correlated with the market as
other investments. In market downturns, however, the risk profile of these investments
can rise.
We will return to the discussion of merger arbitrage in Chapter 6.
LEVERAGED BUYOUTS AND THE PRIVATE EQUITY MARKET
In a leveraged buyout (LBO), a buyer uses debt to finance the acquisition of a company.
The term is usually reserved, however, for acquisition of public companies where the
acquired company becomes private. This is referred to as going private because all of the
public equity is purchased, usually by a small group or a single buyer, and the company’s
shares are no longer traded in securities markets. One version of an LBO is a management
buyout. In a management buyout, the buyer of a company, or a division of a company, is
the manager of the entity.
Most LBOs are buyouts of small and medium-sized companies or divisions of large
companies. However, what was then the largest transaction of all time, the 1989 $25.1
billion LBO of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts, shook the financial world.
The leveraged buyout business declined after the fourth merger wave but rebounded in
the fifth wave and then reached new highs in the 2000s (Figure 1.4). While LBOs were
mainly a U.S. phenomenon in the 1980s, they became international in the 1990s and
have remained that way since.
LBOs utilize a significant amount of debt along with an equity investment. Often
this equity investment comes from investment pools created by private equity firms.
These firms solicit investments from institutional investors. The monies are used to
acquire equity positions in various companies. Sometimes these private equity buyers
acquire entire companies while in other instances they take equity positions in compa-
nies. The private equity business grew significantly between 2003 and 2007; however,
when the global economy entered a recession in 2008 the business slowed markedly

further in Chapter 9.
CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING
Thetermcorporaterestructuringusuallyreferstoassetsell-offs,suchasdivestitures.Com-
panies that have acquired other firms or have developed other divisions through activ-
ities such as product extensions may decide that these divisions no longer fit into the
company’s plans. The desire to sell parts of a company may come from poor performance
of a division, financial exigency, or a change in the strategic orientation of the company.
Forexample,thecompanymaydecidetorefocusonitscorebusinessandselloffnon-core

many companies that engaged in diverse acquisition campaigns to build conglomer-
ates began to question the advisability of these combinations. There are several forms

of corporate sell-offs, with divestitures being only one kind. Spin and equity carve-outs
are other ways that sell-offs can be accomplished. The relative benefits of each of these
alternative means of selling off part of a company are discussed in Chapter 11.
MERGER NEGOTIATIONS
Most M&As are negotiated in a friendly environment. For buyer-initiated takeovers,
the process usually begins when the management of one firm contacts the target
company’s management, often through the investment bankers of each company.
For seller-initiated deals, the seller may hire an investment banker, who will contact
prospective bidders. If the potential bidders sign a confidentiality agreement and agree
to not make an unsolicited bid, they may receive nonpublic information. The seller and
its investment banker may conduct an auction or may choose to negotiate with just one
bidder to reach an agreeable price. Auctions can be constructed more formally, with
specific bidding rules established by the seller, or they can be less formal.
The management of both the buyer and seller keep their respective boards of direc-
tors up to date on the progress of the negotiations because mergers usually require the
boards’ approval. Sometimes this process works smoothly and leads to a quick merger
agreement. A good example of this was the 2009 $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth Corp.
by Pfizer. In spite of the size of this deal, there was a quick meeting of the minds by man-
agement of these two firms, and a friendly deal was agreed to relatively quickly. However,
in some circumstances, a quick deal may not be the best. AT&T’s $48 billion acquisition
of TCI is an example of a friendly deal, where the buyer did not do its homework and the
seller did a good job of accommodating the buyer’s (AT&T’s) desire to do a quick deal at
a higher price. Speed may help ward off unwanted bidders, but it may work against a
close scrutiny of the transaction.
Sometimes friendly negotiations may break down, leading to the termination of the
bid or a hostile takeover. An example of a negotiated deal that failed and led to a hos-
tile bid was the tender offer by Moore Corporation for Wallace Computer Services, Inc.
Here, negotiations between two archrivals in the business forms and printing business
proceeded for five months before they were called off, leading to a $1.3 billion hostile bid.
In 2003, Moore reached agreement to acquire Wallace and form Moore Wallace. One
year later, Moore Wallace merged with RR Donnelley.
In other instances, the target opposes the bid right away and the transaction quickly
becomes a hostile one. One classic example of a very hostile bid was the 2004 takeover
battle between Oracle and PeopleSoft. This takeover contest was unusual due to its pro-
tracted length. The battle went on for approximately a year before PeopleSoft finally
capitulated and accepted a higher Oracle bid.
Most merger agreements include a material adverse change clause. This clause may
allow either party to withdraw from the deal if a major change in circumstances arises
that would alter the value of the deal. This occurred in 2017 when Verizon and Yahoo!
both agreed to reduce the price paid for Yahoo!’s Internet business by $350 million,
down to $4.48 billion, as a result of the data breaches at Yahoo!

Introduction
Auctions versus Private Negotiations
Many believe that auctions may result in higher takeover premiums. Boone and Mul-
herin analyzed the takeover process related to 377 completed and 23 withdrawn acqui-
sitions that occurred in the 1990s.2 Regarding the auctions in their sample, they found
that, on average, 21 bidders were contacted and 7 eventually signed confidentiality and
standstillagreements.Incontrast,theprivatenegotiateddealsfeaturedthesellerdealing
with a single bidder.
Boone and Mulherin found that more than half of deals involved auctions; the belief
in the beneficial effects of auctions raised the question of why all deals are not made
through auctions. One explanation may be agency costs. Boone and Mulherin analyzed
this issue using an event study methodology, which compared the wealth effects to tar-
gets of auctions and negotiated transactions. Somewhat surprisingly, they failed to find
support for the agency theory. Their results failed to show much difference in the share-
holder wealth effects of auctions compared to privately negotiated transactions. This
result hasimportant policy implicationsastherehasbeensomevocal pressureto require
mandated auctions. The Boone and Mulherin results imply that this pressure may be
misplaced.
Conﬁdentiality Agreements
When two companies engage in negotiations, the buyer often wants access to nonpub-
lic information from the target, which may serve as the basis for an offer acceptable to
the target. A typical agreement requires that the buyer, the recipient of the confidential
information, not use the information for any purposes other than the friendly deal at
issue. This excludes any other uses, including making a hostile bid. While these agree-
ments are negotiable, their terms often are fairly standard.
Confidentiality agreements, sometimes also referred to as nondisclosure agree-
ments (NDAs), define the responsibilities of recipients and providers of confidential
information. They usually cover not just information about the operations of the target,
including intellectual property like trade secrets, but also information about the deal
itself. The latter is important in instances where the target does not want the world to
know it is secretly shopping itself.
NDAs often include a standstill agreement, which limits actions the bidder can take,
such as purchases of the target’s shares. Standstill agreements often cover a period such
as a year or more. We discuss them further in Chapter 5. However, it is useful to merely
point out now that these agreements usually set a stock purchase ceiling below 5%,
as purchases beyond that level may require a Schedule 13D disclosure (discussed in
Chapter 3), which may serve to put the company in play.
In cases where there is a potential merger between horizontal competitors, the par-
ties may also sign a joint defense agreement (JDA) that governs how confidential infor-
mation will be handled after a possible merger agreement but where there is opposition
by antitrust or other regulatory authorities.

Merger Negotiations
◾
23
Initial Agreement
When the parties have reached the stage where there are clear terms upon which the
buyer is prepared to make an offer that it thinks the seller may accept, the buyer prepares
a term sheet. This is a document that the buyer usually controls but that the seller may
have input into. It may not be binding, but it is prepared so that the major terms of the
deal are set forth in writing, thus reducing uncertainty as to the main aspects of the deal.
Thesaleprocessinvolvesinvestingsignificanttimeandmonetaryexpenses,andtheterm
sheet helps reduce the likelihood that parties will incur such expenses and be surprised
that there was not prior agreement on what each thought were the major terms of the
deal. At this point in the process, a great deal of due diligence work has to be done before
a final agreement is reached. When the seller is conducting an auction for the firm, it
may prepare a term sheet that can be circulated to potential buyers so they know what
is needed to close the deal.
While the contents will vary, the typical term sheet identifies the buyer and
seller, the purchase price, and the factors that may cause that price to vary prior to
closing (such as changes in the target’s financial performance). It will also indicate the
consideration the buyer will use (i.e., cash or stock), as well as who pays what expenses.
While many other elements could be added based on the unique circumstances of the
deal, the term sheet should also include the major representations and warranties the
parties are making.
Letter of Intent
The term sheet may be followed by a more detailed letter of intent (LOI). This letter delin-
eates more of the detailed terms of the agreement. It may or may not be binding on the
parties. LOIs vary in their detail. Some specify the purchase price while others may only
define a range or formula. It may also define various closing conditions, such as pro-
viding for the acquirer to have access to various records of the target. Other conditions,
such as employment agreements for key employees, may also be noted. However, many
merger partners enter into a merger agreement right away. An LOI is something less
than that, and it may reflect one of the parties not necessarily being prepared to enter
into a formal merger agreement, For example, a private equity firm might sign an LOI
when it does not yet have firm deal financing. This could alert investors, such as arbi-
tragers, that the deal may possibly never be completed.
Given the nonbinding nature of many LOIs, one may wonder what their real pur-
poseis.However,theycanhelpsetforthsomeinitialmajordealparameterssuchasprice.
They also can be used to establish the seriousness of the merger partners before lenders.
The LOI may also contain an exclusivity provision which may limit the seller’s ability to
shop the target. This latter benefit will be subject to Revlon Duties—an issue that will be
explored in Chapters 3 and 5.
The due diligence process varies greatly from deal-to-deal. It is a process that
involves the extensive use of accounting, legal, and valuation consultants. It is so
extensive that it is worthy of a book of its own; thus we will not go further into the
process here.

Introduction
Disclosure of Merger Negotiations
Before 1988, it was not clear what obligations U.S. companies involved in merger
negotiations had to disclose their activities. However, in 1988, in the landmark Basic
v. Levinson decision, the U.S. Supreme Court made it clear that a denial that negoti-
ations are taking place, when the opposite is the case, is improper.3 Companies may
not deceive the market by disseminating inaccurate or deceptive information, even
when the discussions are preliminary and do not show much promise of coming to
fruition. The Court’s decision reversed earlier positions that had treated proposals or
negotiations as being immaterial. The Basic v. Levinson decision does not go so far as
to require companies to disclose all plans or internal proposals involving acquisitions.
Negotiations between two potential merger partners, however, may not be denied.
The exact timing of the disclosure is still not clear. Given the requirement to disclose,
a company’s hand may be forced by the pressure of market speculation. It is often
difficult to confidentially continue such negotiations and planning for any length of
time. Rather than let the information slowly leak, the company has an obligation to
conduct an orderly disclosure once it is clear that confidentiality may be at risk or that
prior statements the company has made are no longer accurate. In cases in which there
is speculation that a takeover is being planned, significant market movements in stock
prices of the companies involved—particularly the target—may occur. Such market
movements may give rise to an inquiry from the exchange on which the company
trades. Although exchanges have come under criticism for being somewhat lax about
enforcing these types of rules, an insufficient response from the companies involved
may give rise to disciplinary actions against the companies.
DEAL STRUCTURE: ASSET VERSUS ENTITY DEALS
The choice of doing an asset deal as opposed to a whole entity deal usually has to do with
how much of the target is being sold. If the deal is for only part of the target’s business,
then usually an asset deal works best.
Asset Deals
One of the advantages for the acquirer of an asset deal is that the buyer does not have
to accept all of the target’s liabilities. This is the subject of negotiation between the par-
ties. The seller will want the buyer to accept more liabilities while the buyer wants fewer
liabilities. The benefit of limiting liability exposure is one reason a buyer may prefer an
asset deal. Another benefit of an asset acquisition is that the buyer can pick and choose
which assets it wants and not have to pay for assets that it is not interested in. All the
assets acquired and liabilities incurred are listed in the asset purchase agreement.
3 Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988). The U.S. Supreme Court revisited this case in 2014 and addressed
the case’s reliance on the efficiency of markets in processing information. The Court declined to reverse Basic
on this issue.

Deal Structure: Asset versus Entity Deals

realize asset basis step-up. This can come from the buyer raising the value of the acquired
assets to fair market value as opposed to the values they may have been carried at on
the seller’s balance sheet. Through such an increase in value the buyer can enjoy more
depreciation in the future, which, in turn, may lower its taxable income and taxes paid.
Sellers may prefer a whole entity deal. In an asset deal, the seller may be left with
assetsitdoesnotwant.Thisisparticularlytruewhenthesellerissellingmostofitsassets.
Here, they are left with liabilities that they would prefer getting rid of. In addition, the
seller may possibly get hit with negative tax consequences due to potential taxes on the
sale of the assets and then taxes on a distribution to the owners of the entity. Exceptions
could be entities that are 80% owned subsidiaries, pass-through entities, or businesses
that are LLPs or LLCs. Tax issues are very important in M&As. This is why much legal
work is done in M&As not only by transactional lawyers but also by tax lawyers. Attor-
neys who are M&A tax specialists can be very important in doing deals, and this is a
subspecialty of the law separate from transactional M&A law.
There are still more drawbacks to asset deals, in that the seller may have to secure
third-party consents to the sale of the assets. This may be necessary if there are clauses
in the financing agreements the target used to acquire the assets. It also could be the
case if the seller has many contracts with nonassignment or nontransfer clauses associated
with them. In order to do an asset deal, the target needs to get approval from the relevant
parties. The more of them there are, the more complicated the deal becomes. When these
complications are significant, an asset deal becomes less practical, and if a deal is to be
done, it may have to be an entity transaction.
Entity Deals
There are two ways to do an entity deal—a stock transaction or a merger. When the
target has a limited number of shareholders, it may be practical to do a stock deal, as
securing approval of the sale by the target’s shareholders may not be that difficult. The
fewer the number of shareholders, the more practical this may be. However, when deal-
ing with a large public company with a large and widely distributed shareholder base, a
merger is often the way to go.
Stock Entity Deals
In a stock entity deal, deals that are more common involving closely held companies, the
buyer does not have to buy the assets and send the consideration to the target corpora-
tion as it would have done in an asset deal. Instead, the consideration is sent directly to
the target’s shareholders, who sell all their shares to the buyer. One of the advantages of
a stock deal is that there are no conveyance issues, such as what there might have been
with an asset deal, where there may have been the aforementioned contractual restric-
tions on transfer of assets. With a stock deal, the assets stay with the entity and remain
at the target, as opposed to the acquirer’s level.
One other benefit that a stock deal has over a merger is that there are no appraisal
rights with a stock deal. In a merger, shareholders who do not approve of the deal may

26

Introduction
want to go to court to pursue their appraisal rights and seek the difference between the
value they received for their shares in the merger and what they believe is the true value
of the shares. In recent years, the volume of appraisal litigation in Delaware has risen.
This is, in part, due to the position the Delaware court has taken regarding the wide
latitude it has in determining what a “fair value” is.4 We will discuss appraisal litigation
later in this chapter.
One of the disadvantages of an entity deal is that the buyer may have to assume
certain liabilities it may not want to have. One way a buyer can do a stock deal and
not have to incur the potential adverse exposure to certain target liabilities it does not
want is to have the seller indemnify it against this exposure. Here, the buyer accepts
the unwanted liabilities but gets the benefit of the seller’s indemnification against this
exposure. However, if the buyer has concerns about the long-term financial ability of
the target to truly back up this indemnification, then it may pass on the stock deal.
Another disadvantage of a stock-entity deal is that the target shareholders have to
approve the deal. If some of them oppose the deal, it cannot be completed. When this is
the case, then the companies have to pursue a merger. When the target is a large public
corporation with many shareholders, this is the way to go.
Merger Entity Deals
Mergers, which are more common for publicly held companies, are partly a function
of the relevant state laws, which can vary from state-to-state. Fortunately, as we will
discuss in Chapter 3, more U.S. public corporations are incorporated in Delaware than
any other state, so we can discuss legal issues with Delaware law in mind. However, there
are many similarities between Delaware corporation laws and those of other states.
In merger laws, certain terminology is commonly encountered. Constituent corpora-
tions are the two companies doing the deal. In a merger, one company survives, called
the survivor, and the other ceases to exist.
In a merger, the surviving corporation succeeds to all of the liabilities of the nonsur-
viving company. If this is a concern to the buyer, then a simple merger structure is not
the way to go. If there are assets that are unwanted by the buyer, then these can be spun
out or sold off before the merger is completed.
In a merger, the voting approval of the shareholders is needed. In Delaware the
approval of a majority of the shareholders is required. This percentage can vary across
states, and there can be cases where a corporation has enacted supermajority provisions
in its bylaws. Shareholders who do not approve the deal can go to court to pursue their
appraisal rights.
Forward Merger
The basic form of a merger is a forward merger, which is sometimes also called a statutory
merger. Here the target merges directly into the purchaser corporation, and then the
target disappears while the purchaser survives. The target shares are exchanged for cash

Deal Structure: Asset versus Entity Deals

or a combination of cash and securities. The purchaser assumes the target’s liabilities,
which is a drawback of this structure. However, given the assumption of these liabilities,
there are usually no conveyance issues. Another drawback is that Delaware law treats
forward mergers as though they were asset sales, so if the target has many contracts
with third-party consents or nonassignment clauses, this may not be an advantageous
route for the parties. Given the position of Delaware law on forward mergers, these deals
look a lot like assets deals that are followed by a liquidation of the target, because the
assets of the target move from the target to the buyer and the target disappears while
the deal consideration ends up with the target’s shareholders.
A big negative of a basic forward merger is that the voting approval of the share-
holders of both companies is needed. This can add an element of uncertainty to the
deal. Another drawback is that the buyer directly assumes all of the target’s liabilities,
thereby exposing the buyer’s assets to the target’s liabilities. It is for these reasons that
this deal structure is not that common. The solution is for the buyer to “drop down” a
subsidiary and do a subsidiary deal. There are two types of subsidiary mergers—forward
and reverse.
Forward Subsidiary Merger
This type of deal is sometimes called a forward triangular merger, given the structure
shape shown in Figure 1.5. Instead of the target merging directly into the purchaser, the
purchaser creates a merger subsidiary and the target merges directly into the subsidiary.
There are a number of advantages of this structure. First, there is no automatic vote
required to approve the deal. In addition, the purchaser is not exposing its assets to the
liabilities of the target. In this way, the main purchaser corporation is insulated from this
potential exposure.
As with much of finance, there are exceptions to the approval benefit. If the buyer
issues 20% or more of its stock to finance the deal, the New York Stock Exchange and
NASDAQ require approval of the purchaser’s shareholders. There could also be concerns
about litigants piercing the corporate veil and going directly after the purchaser corpo-
ration’s assets.

Reverse Subsidiary Merger
Reverse subsidiary mergers, also called reverse triangular mergers (see Figure 1.6),
improve upon the forward subsidiary merger by reversing the direction of the merger.
The acquirer subsidiary pays the target’s shareholders and receives the shares in the
target in exchange. Here, the subsidiary formed for the purposes of the deal merges
directly into the target. The target corporation survives, and the subsidiary goes out of
existence.
There are key advantages of this structure. One is that the assets of the target do
not move anywhere. Therefore, there should be no problems with nonassignment or
nonassignability clauses.
MERGER AGREEMENT
Once the due diligence process has been completed, the law firms representing the par-
ties prepare a detailed merger agreement. It is usually initiated by the buyer’s law firm
and is the subject of much back-and-forth negotiation. This document is usually long
and complex—especially in billion-dollar deals involving public companies. However,
some of the key components are sections that define the purchase price and considera-
tion to be used. The agreement also includes all representations and warranties, what is
expected of the seller and buyer prior to closing, the details of the closing (i.e., location
and date), and what could cause a termination of the agreement. If the buyer incurs a
penaltyifitterminates,thoseterminationfeesaredefined.Attachedtothemergeragree-
ment is a whole host of supporting documents. These may include copies of resolutions
by the seller’s board of directors approving the deal as well as many other documents
that are far too numerous to be listed here.
As noted earlier, the merger agreement may contain a material adverse event (MAE)
or change clause that may allow the buyer to back out upon the occurrence of certain
adverse events. Usually, if the buyer opts out based on this clause, protracted litigation
may ensue.

Merger Approval Procedures
◾
29
MERGER APPROVAL PROCEDURES
In the United States, each state has a statute that authorizes M&As of corporations. The
rules may be different for domestic and foreign corporations. Once the board of directors
of each company reaches an agreement, it adopts a resolution approving the deal. This
resolution should include the names of the companies involved in the deal and the name
of the new company. The resolution should include the financial terms of the deal and
other relevant information, such as the method that is to be used to convert securities of
each company into securities of the surviving corporation. If there are any changes in
the articles of incorporation, these should be referenced in the resolution.
For the target company, this is the point in the deal process at which it is taken to the
shareholders for approval. In deals where the bidder is financing the offer using 20% or
more of its own stock, NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ rules require shareholder approval.
Recent research shows that when bidders issue as much as 20% or more of their shares
to acquire the target, they experience a 4.3% increase in their announcement returns.5
Presumably, this may be related to greater expected synergies and a lower likelihood
of overpayment. The researchers found this effect was concentrated among acquirers
with greater institutional ownership —investors who are in a better position to evaluate
the deal.
Friendly deals that are a product of a free negotiation process between the manage-
ment of the two companiesare typically approved by shareholders. Following sharehold-
ers’approval,themergerplanmustbesubmittedtotherelevantstateofficial,usuallythe
secretary of state. The document that contains this plan is called the articles for merger
or consolidation. Once the state official determines that the proper documentation has
been received, it issues a certificate of merger or consolidation. SEC rules require a proxy
solicitation to be accompanied by a Schedule 14A. Item 14 of this schedule sets forth
the specific information that must be included in a proxy statement when there will be a
vote for an approval of a merger, sale of substantial assets, or liquidation or dissolution
of the corporation. For a merger, this information must include the terms and reasons
for the transaction as well as a description of the accounting treatment and tax conse-
quences of the deal. Financial statements and a statement regarding relevant state and
federal regulatory compliance are required. Fairness opinions and other related docu-
ments must also be included. Following completion of a deal, the target/registrant must
file a Form 15 with the SEC terminating the public registration of its securities.
Special Committees of the Board of Directors
The board of directors may choose to form a special committee of the board to evaluate
the merger proposal. Directors who might personally benefit from the merger, such as
when the buyout proposal contains provisions that management directors may poten-
tially profit from the deal, should not be members of this committee. The more complex

Introduction
the transaction, the more likely it is that a committee will be appointed. This committee
should seek legal counsel to guide it on legal issues, such as the fairness of the transac-
tion, the business judgment rule, and numerous other legal issues. The committee, and
the board in general, needs to make sure that it carefully considers all relevant aspects of
the transaction. A court may later scrutinize the decision-making process, such as what
occurred in the Smith v. Van Gorkom case (see Chapter 15).6 In that case the court found
the directors personally liable because it thought that the decision-making process was
inadequate, even though the decision itself was apparently a good one for shareholders.
Fairness Opinions
It is common for the board to retain an outside valuation firm, such as an investment
bank or a firm that specializes in valuations, to evaluate the transaction’s terms and
price. This firm may then render a fairness opinion, in which it may state that the offer
is in a range that it determines to be accurate. This became even more important after
the Smith v. Van Gorkom decision, which places directors under greater scrutiny. Direc-
tors who rely on fairness opinions from an expert are protected under Delaware law from
personal liability.7 In an acquisition, the fairness opinion focuses on the financial fair-
ness of the consideration paid by the buyer to the seller. In connection with a divesti-
ture, the fairness opinion focuses on the fairness to the corporation as opposed to the
stockholders of the company. Only if the shareholders directly receive the buyer’s con-
sideration will the fairness opinion focus on fairness to the holders of the seller’s shares.
A fairness opinion could focus on fairness to the buyer in light of the amount it is
paying. Like all valuations, fairness opinions are specific to a valuation date, and the
issuers of such opinions generally disclaim any responsibility to update them with the
passage of time and the occurrence of other relevant events.8
It is important to note that fairness opinions tend to have a narrow financial focus
and usually do not try to address the strategic merits of a given transaction. Writers of
such opinions also try to avoid making recommendations to shareholders on how they
should vote on the transactions. They also avoid consideration of many relevant aspects
of a deal, such as lockup provisions, no-shop provisions, termination fees, and financing
arrangements.
The cost of fairness opinions can vary, but it tends to be lower for smaller deals com-
pared to larger ones. For deals valued under $5 billion, for example, the cost of a fairness
opinion might be in the $500,000 range. For larger deals, however, costs can easily be
several million dollars. The actual opinion itself may be somewhat terse and usually fea-
tures a limited discussion of the underlying financial analysis. As part of the opinion that
is rendered, the evaluator should state what was investigated and verified and what was
not. The fees received and any potential conflicts of interest should also be revealed.

Short-Form Merger

Voting Approval
Uponreachingagreeabletermsandreceivingboardapproval,thedealistakenbeforethe
shareholders for their approval, which is granted through a vote. For example, in 2016,
99%ofMonsanto’sshareholderswhovoted,representing75%ofallsharesoutstanding,
approved the $66 billion merger of the company with Bayer.9
The exact percentage necessary for stockholder approval depends on the articles of
incorporation, which, in turn, are regulated by the prevailing state corporation laws.
Following approval, each firm files the necessary documents with the state authorities
in which each firm is incorporated. Once this step is completed and the compensation
has changed hands, the deal is completed.
DEAL CLOSING
The closing of a merger or acquisition often takes place well after the agreement has
been reached. This is because many conditions have to be fulfilled prior to the eventual
closing. Among them may be the formal approval by shareholders. In addition, the par-
ties may also need to secure regulatory approvals from governmental authorities, such
as the Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission as well as regulators in other
nationsinthecaseofglobalfirms.Inmanycases,thefinalpurchasepricewillbeadjusted
according to the formula specified in the agreement.
SHORT-FORM MERGER
A short-form merger may take place in situations in which the stockholder approval
process is not necessary. Stockholder approval may be bypassed when the corporation’s
stock is concentrated in the hands of a small group, such as management, which is advo-
cating the merger. Some state laws may allow this group to approve the transaction on
its own without soliciting the approval of the other stockholders. The board of directors
simply approves the merger by a resolution.
A short-form merger may occur only when the stockholdings of insiders are beyond
a certain threshold stipulated in the prevailing state corporation laws. This percentage
varies, depending on the state in which the company is incorporated. Under Delaware
law, the short-form merger percentage is 90%. This is the relevant percentage for most
states although a few, such as Alabama, Florida, and Montana, have an 80% threshold.
A short-term merger may follow a tender offer as a second-step transaction, where
shareholders who did not tender their shares to a bidder who acquired substantially all
of the target’s shares may be frozen out of their positions.

Introduction
FREEZEOUTS AND THE TREATMENT OF MINORITY
SHAREHOLDERS
Typically, a majority of shareholders must provide their approval before a merger can
be completed. A 51% margin is a common majority threshold. When this majority
approves the deal, minority shareholders are required to tender their shares to the
controlling shareholder, even though they may not have voted in favor of the deal.
Minority shareholders are said to be frozen out of their positions. This majority
approval requirement is designed to prevent a holdout problem, which may occur
when a minority attempts to hold up the completion of a transaction unless they
receive compensation over and above the acquisition stock price. This is not to say that
dissenting shareholders are without rights. Those shareholders who believe that their
shares are worth significantly more than what the terms of the merger are offering may
go to court to pursue their shareholder appraisal rights. To successfully pursue these
rights, dissenting shareholders must follow the proper procedures. Paramount among
these procedures is the requirement that the dissenting shareholders object to the deal
within the designated period of time. Then they may demand a cash settlement for the
difference between the “fair value” of their shares and the compensation they actually
received. Of course, corporations resist these maneuvers because the payment of cash
for the value of shares will raise problems relating to the positions of other stockholders.
Such suits are difficult for dissenting shareholders to win. Dissenting shareholders may
file a suit only if the corporation does not file suit to have the fair value of the shares
determined, after having been notified of the dissenting shareholders’ objections. If
there is a suit, the court may appoint an appraiser to assist in the determination of the
fair value.
Freezeouts can occur following tender offers as well as controlling shareholder
closeouts in going private transactions. Prior to the 2001 Siliconix decision, all freezeout
bids in Delaware were subject to the demanding “entire fairness” standard governing
such transactions.10 In Siliconix, the Delaware Chancery Court decided that freezeouts
in tender offers would not be subject to this standard. Subramanian analyzed a database
of freezeouts in the years immediately following the Siliconix decision and found out
that controlling shareholders paid less to minority shareholders in tender offers than
they did in mergers.11
Following an M&A, it is not unusual that months after the deal, as many as 10% to
20% of shareholders still have not exchanged their frozen-out shares for compensation.
For a fee, companies, such as Georgeson Securities Corporation, offer services paid by
the shareholders where they locate the shareholders and seek to have them exchange
their shares.

Appraisal Arbitrage
◾
33
APPRAISAL ARBITRAGE
We have noted that shareholders who do not want to exchange their shares for the
offeredconsiderationcangotocourt(andthisusuallymeansDelawareChanceryCourt)
to pursue their appraisal rights. Here, the dissenting shareholders ask a court to judi-
cially determine the value of their shares and to order that they be paid this value in
cash. These dissenting shareholders have 120 days to file suit. Essentially, the potential
appraisal payments are a post-closing obligation of the buyer. Certain hedge funds have
pursued this appraisal process as an investment strategy—appraisal arbitrage.
The legal appraisal system allows hedge funds that own shares to pursue their
alleged higher value in court and ultimately get their higher appraised value or accrued
interest on the original deal price less appraisal costs. The plaintiffs in these matters
forgo the payment by the bidder while they seek a higher appraised value. The law then
allows them to receive interest on the amount they are ultimately awarded.
The interest rate is set at 5% above the Federal Reserve’s discount rate, which can
be attractive in a low interest rate environment such as what prevailed in the post–
subprime crisis years. Hedge funds are also allowed to purchase shares in the market
after the deal announcement date, and also after the record date for voting on the offer,
and up to the effective date of the deal. This is a very controversial issue, but it has not yet
been corrected in Delaware law. In addition, it is rare for courts to determine a value less
than the offer price, so it is likely that those seeking appraisal rights will get the offer price
or more and then also interest on what they receive—hence the term appraisal arbitrage.
The fact that the appraised values determined by the court are usually at least equal
to the deal price is somewhat surprising, in light of the fact that the Appraisal Statute
(Section 262) states that the value should be one that is derived from stock prices prior
to the deal announcement and, therefore, theoretically might not include any additional
premium reflecting synergies.
In recent years, the Delaware legislature has tried to rein in the abuses on appraisal
arbitrage by the de minimus exception, which barred small claims by requiring those who
want to seek appraisal rights to own more than 1% of the target or at least $1 million
worth of stock.12 This did not really slow down hedge funds—especially when we note
that it is highly likely the appraised value would be at least the offer price and they could
get attractive interest. The rules were also changed to allow for cutting off the running
in the interest payments by allowing defendants to prepay the interest up to the date of
their payment. So, for example, in a deal where the per share offer price was $20 and
the plaintiffs are seeking $25, the defendant could pay $18 and have the interest on the
$18 stopped while the ultimate value gets decided by the court at some later date. The
interest on the difference between $18 and the value set by the court would have interest
run for the full length of time until the decision came down from the court.13
12 The de minimis exception does not apply to short form mergers.
13 The law does not provide for any clawback of any of the payments and related interest. Sticking with the
example discussed in the text above, if the company paid $18 but the court decided on a lower appraised value
such as $16 (unlikely), there would be no refund required.

REVERSE MERGERS
A reverse merger is a merger in which a private company may go public by merging
with an already-public company that often is inactive or a corporate shell. A shell com-
pany is a company that went public in the past but no longer conducts business opera-
tions and has few, if any, physical assets and its assets consist mainly of cash and cash
equivalents. The combined company may then choose to issue securities and may not

Reverse Mergers

have to incur all of the costs and scrutiny that normally would be associated with an
initial public offering. The private-turned-public company then has greatly enhanced
liquidity for its equity. Another advantage is that the process can take place quickly
and at lower costs than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). Instead of working
with an underwriter to help with an IPO, the private operating company works with
a “shell promoter” who will help it find a suitable nonoperating shell. Shell promot-
ers often get control of defunct public companies by buying enough of their shares to
get control. The private operating company merges with the shell, or a subsidiary of
the shell, and its shareholders exchange their shares for shares of the shell. After the
deal, the shell contains the assets and liabilities of the private operating company and
its shareholders are the former private operating company shareholders. The shell pro-
moters charge a fee for their services and often retain an ownership interest in the new
operating company.
A reverse merger may take between two and three months to complete, whereas an
IPO is a more involved process that may take many months longer.14 Reverse mergers
usually do not involve as much dilution as IPOs, which may involve investment bankers
requiring the company to issue more shares than what it would prefer. In addition,
reverse mergers are less dependent on the state of the IPO market. When the IPO
market is weak, reverse mergers can still be viable. For these reasons, there is usually a
steady flow of reverse mergers, which explains why it is common to see in the financial
media corporate “shells” advertised for sale to private companies seeking this avenue to
go public.
While reverse mergers and IPOs have certain aspects in common there are also
important differences. One key difference is that a reverse merger is not a capital rais-
ing event, whereas the traditional IPO is. In a reverse merger shares are exchanged but
usually not cash. Typically, the only cash that is exchanged are monies the private oper-
ating company pays to the shell promoter (several hundred thousand dollars). Another
significant difference is that in an IPO, an underwriter may be active in trying to make
a market for the IPO shares. However, with reverse mergers, the shares are usually very
thinly traded after the deal. Because of this, insiders usually cannot use a reverse merger
to cash out their ownership in the firm, whereas in an IPO this may be possible. Due to
thelowliquidityofreversemergershares,theyoftentradewithamarketabilitydiscount.
In light of these differences, reverse mergers bring few benefits from being public but,
nonetheless, carry with them the same costs and requirements that public companies
face. One way, though, that a reverse merger may enable a company to raise capital is
through later transactions involving private investments in public equity (PIPE). Here
the company may be able to work with specialized investment bankers to raise capital
through the sale of debt and also the now public shares.
The number of reverse mergers generally increased from 2003 to 2010 but fell
over the period 2011–2016. In terms of value, the business greatly declined after a
banner year in 2006 until 2014, when it began to rebound (see Figure 1.7). In terms

of deal value, however, 2006 was the banner year and the value of these deals gen-
erally declined over the years 2008–2013 but rebounded significantly over the years
2014–2016.
For many companies, going public through a reverse merger may seem attractive,
but it actually lacks some of the important benefits of a traditional IPO—benefits that
make the financial and time costs of an IPO worthwhile. The traditional IPO allows the
company going public to raise capital and usually provides an opportunity for the own-
ers of the closely held company to liquidate their previously illiquid privately held shares.
This does not automatically happen in a reverse merger. If the company wants to sell
shares after the reverse merger, it still has to make a public offering, although it may
be less complicated than an IPO. Being public after a reverse merger does not mean the
shares of the combined company are really liquid. It all depends on how attractive the
company is to the market and the condition of the market itself.
One advantage of doing a reverse merger is that it gives the company more liquid
shares to use to purchase other target companies. Prospective targets might be reluctant
to accept illiquid shares from a privately held bidder. Shares from a public company for
which there is an active market are often more appealing. Thus if the goal is to finance
stock-for-stock acquisitions, a reverse merger may have some appeal.
Reverse mergers have often been associated with stock scams, as market manipula-
tors have often merged private companies with little business activity into public shells
and tried to “hype” up the stock to make short-term fraudulent gains. The SEC has tried
to keep an eye out for these manipulators and limit such opportunities.
Special Purchase Acquisition Vehicles
Special purchase acquisition vehicles (SPACs) are companies that raise capital in an IPO
where the funds are earmarked for acquisitions. This is a very different type of IPO as
most IPOs raise capital to grow a business as well as to create liquidity for the closely held
shares. SPACs are sometimes also referred to as blank-check companies, or cash-shells.
There were SPACs in the 1990s, but they were not successful. The person who is
considered the creator of the SPAC is David Nussbaum, who founded an investment bank
called EarlyBirdCapital. He filed an S-1 in 2003 to take Millstream Acquisition Corpora-
tion. This company raised over $20 million to acquire NationsHealth in 2004.
In 2008, NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange began to list SPACs, and this
gave a great boost to their popularity. SPACs were particularly popular between 2006
and 2007 but have generally declined since then. In terms of capital raised, the business
improved in the years 2015–2017 but remains well below the 2007 peak levels. This
decline was caused by the fallout from the subprime crisis and the Great Recession that
followed (see Figure 1.8). However, in recent years, especially in 2017, the business has
rebounded.
SPACsstart off life asa corporate shell. Thefoundersof theSPACpurchasetheshares
of the shell at a nominal price, such as a few cents, and then these shares are used for
the IPO. Like other IPOs this requires a filing of a Form S-1. In that filing, the founders
may provide information or the nature of the acquisition targets they will seek. This
information may specify a target industry or country.

Usually, particularly forSPACsregulated by thelisting requirementsof theNewYork
Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ, 90% of the funds raised in the IPO are placed in an
independently overseen trust account which earns a rate of return, such as the T-bill
rate, while the company seeks to invest the monies in acquisitions. The percentage that
ends up being placed in the account is affected by factors such as underwriting fees. The
remainder of the monies can go toward expenses.

Introduction
In March 2017, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) updated its rules governing
SPACs so as to be more competitive with NASDAQ, which had been the leader in such list-
ings.15 Up until the changes in the NYSE SPAC rules, the NYSE had not listed an SPAC
in a decade. The new NYSE rules included the aforementioned requirement governing
the placement of 90% of the funds raised in a trust account as well relaxing corporate
governance rules on approval of an acquisition and also lowering the minimum listing
size of an SPAC from $200 million to $80 million. Later in 2017, NASDAQ also relaxed
its rules in an effort to maintain the competitive advantage in SPAC listings over NYSE.
For example, while the NYSE’s requirement for the minimum number of round lot share-
holders is 300 (down from 400), NASDAQ lowered its minimum from 300 to 150. These
lowered listing requirements help boost SPAC volume in 2017 (see Figure 1.8).
SPACs usually provide for a no-vote threshold. This is the maximum percentage of
voting shareholders who can vote against a deal and have it still go forward. Typical
percentages are 20% to 30%.
SPACs are risky investments as it is possible that the company may not complete an
acquisition. If that is the case, investors could get back less money than they originally
invested. Even when the company does complete deals, they do not know in advance
what targets will be acquired.
The IPO offerings of SPACs are unique and differ in many ways from traditional
IPOs. In addition to the differences in the nature of the company that we have discussed,
they usually sell in units that include a share and one or two warrants, which usually
detach from the shares and trade separately a couple of weeks after the IPO. Because the
market for these shares can be illiquid, they often trade at a discount—similar to many
closed-end funds. The post-IPO securities can be interesting investments as they repre-
sent shares in an entity that holds a known amount of cash but that trades at a value
that may be less than this amount.
SPACs are somewhat similar to private equity investments. Lewellen referred to
them as “single-shot” private equity funds.16 Private equity is mainly available only to
institutional investors. For smaller investors, they can enjoy some of the same char-
acteristics as private equity when they invest in SPACs.17 Also, SPAC investments are
more transparent than private equity investments, which have more hidden fees—an
issue that has become more controversial in recent years.
Founders of SPACs benefit by receiving a share, usually 20%, of the value of the
acquisition. Normally, other than this ownership position, the founders of the SPAC do
not receive any remuneration. Their shares usually are locked up for a period, such as
three years, after the IPO date.

In Chapter 4 we discuss the various factors that lead to a value-destroying M&A
strategy. With SPACs, however, there is little strategy, as investors are seeking to convert
their liquid cash into an equity investment in an unknown company. Not surprisingly,
in a study of 169 SPACs over the period 2003–2010, Jenkinson and Sousa found that
over half of the deals immediately destroyed value.18 They compared the per share value
of the SPAC at the time of the deal with the per share trust value. They reasoned that if
the market value is equal to or less than the trust value, the SPAC should be liquidated
and the acquisition should not go forward.
In spite of the disappointing results of Jenkinson and Sousa, there is an explana-
tion for SPACs’ continued popularity. The investments are liquid and the shares have
been sold to the market in the initial IPO. This compares favorably to private equity
investments, which are not very liquid. In addition, as we have noted, SPACs are more
accessible for non-institutional investors.
Research by Vulanovic explored which types of SPACs fared better.19 He found that
SPACs that were more focused and had a management team from a given industry with
a track record of some success tended to not fail. On the other hand, foreign SPACs did
not do as well.
In spite of the fact that the market prices as of the acquisition approval date indi-
cated ex ante that the deals would be value-destroying, more than half of the deals were
nonetheless approved by investors. Jenkinson and Sousa found that investors who went
along with the recommendations of the SPAC founders in spite of a negative signal from
the market suffered –39% cumulative returns within six months and –79% after one
year. The fact that the founders recommended the deal is not surprising, given that they
derived their compensation by receiving 20% of the capital value of any acquisition.
Therefore, they want the investors to approve an acquisition, as that is how they get their
money. The deal may cause investors to lose money, but it can still make the founders a
significant return. In light of the poor performance of SPACs, it is surprising that SPAC
investors approve roughly three-quarters of deals.

CHAPTER TWO
History of Mergers
I
N MUCH OF FINANCE there is very little attention paid to the history of the field.
Rather, the focus is usually on the latest developments and innovations. This seems
to be particularly the case in the United States, where there is less respect for that
which is not new. It is not surprising, then, when we see that many of the mistakes and
types of failed deals that occurred in earlier years tend to be repeated. The market seems
to have a short memory, and we see that a pattern of flawed mergers and acquisitions
(M&As) tends to reoccur. It is for this reason that we need to be aware of the history
of the field. Such an awareness will help us identify the types of deals that have been
problematic in the past.
MERGER WAVES
Six periods of high merger activity, often called merger waves, have taken place in U.S.
history. These periods are characterized by cyclic activity—that is, high levels of merg-
ers followed by periods of relatively fewer deals. The first four waves occurred between
1897 and 1904, 1916 and 1929, 1965 and 1969, and 1984 and 1989. Merger activity
declined at the end of the 1980s but resumed again in the early 1990s to begin the fifth
merger wave. We also had a relatively short but intense merger period between 2003
and 2007.

History of Mergers
What Causes Merger Waves?
Research has shown that merger waves tend to be caused by a combination of economic,
regulatory, and technological shocks.1 The economic shock comes in the form of an
economic expansion that motivates companies to expand to meet the rapidly growing
aggregate demand in the economy. M&A is a faster form of expansion than internal,
organic growth. Regulatory shocks can occur through the elimination of regulatory
barriers that might have prevented corporate combinations. Examples include the
changes in U.S. banking laws that prevented banks from crossing state lines or entering
other industries. Ovtchinnikov found that industry deregulation tends to occur when
industries experience poor performance.2 He found that industry merger partners
tend to be poor performers prior to the merger and they also tend to have significant
excess capacity.
Technological shocks can come in many forms as technological change can bring
about dramatic changes in existing industries and can even create new ones. Harford
shows that these various shocks by themselves are generally not enough to bring about
a merger wave.3 He looked at industry waves, rather than the overall level of M&A activ-
ity, over the period 1981–2000. His research on 35 industry waves that occurred in this
period shows that capital liquidity is also a necessary condition for a wave to take hold.
His findings also indicate that misevaluation or market timing efforts by managers are
not a cause of a wave, although they could be a cause in specific deals. The misevalua-
tion findings, however, are contradicted by Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan,
who found that misevaluation and valuation errors do motivate merger activity.4 They
measure these by comparing market to book ratios to true valuations. These authors do
not say that valuation errors are the sole factor in explaining merger waves, but they say
that they can play an important role that gains in prominence the greater the degree of
misevaluation.
Rau and Stouraitis have analyzed a sample of 151,000 corporate transactions over
the period 1980–2004, including a broader variety of different corporate events than
just M&As. They have found that “corporate waves” seem to begin with new issue waves,
first starting with seasoned equity offerings and then initial public offerings, followed by
stock-financed M&A and later repurchase waves.5 This finding supports the neoclassi-
cal efficiency hypothesis, which suggests that managers will pursue transactions when
they perceive growth opportunities and will engage in repurchases when these oppor-
tunities fade.

Merger Waves and Defensive Mergers
As we have already discussed, some of the prevailing theories of merger waves assert that
they tend to be caused by factors such as technological or regulatory shocks. Another
view that may explain some of the mergers that can occur during a merger wave focuses
on defensive mergers.6 It considers situations where the management of a potential tar-
get wants to maintain their positions and the control they may have over their company.
Rather than lose control to a hostile bidder, often one of their competitors, they may
choose to pursue their own bid for a rival. The combined entity will then be significantly
larger and more of a challenge to acquire and to raise the requisite financing to complete
the deal.
FIRST WAVE, 1897–1904
The first merger wave occurred after the depression of 1883, peaked between 1898
and 1902, and ended in 1904. Although these mergers affected all major mining and
manufacturing industries, certain industries clearly demonstrated a higher incidence
of merger activity.7 According to a National Bureau of Economic Research study by
Professor Ralph Nelson, eight industries—metals, food products, petroleum products,
chemicals, transportation equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, and
bituminous coal—experienced the greatest merger activity. These industries accounted
for approximately two-thirds of all mergers during this period. The mergers of the first
wave were predominantly horizontal combinations. The many horizontal mergers
and industry consolidations of this era often resulted in a near monopolistic market
structure. For this reason, this merger period is known for its role in creating large
monopolies. This period is also associated with the first billion-dollar megamerger
when U.S. Steel was founded by J. P. Morgan, who combined Carnegie Steel, founded
by Andrew Carnegie and run by Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, with Federal Steel,
which Morgan controlled. However, Morgan also added other steel companies, such
as American Tin Plate, American Steel Hoop, American Steel Sheet, American Bridge,
American Steel and Wire, International Mercantile Marine, National Steel, National
Tube, and Shelby Steel Tube, combined under the corporate umbrella of U.S. Steel,
giving the company control of half of the U.S. steel industry.8 The resulting steel giant
merged 785 separate steel-making operations. At one time, U.S. Steel accounted for as
much as 75% of U.S. steel-making capacity.
Besides U.S. Steel, some of today’s great industrial giants originated in the first
merger wave. These include DuPont, Standard Oil, General Electric, Eastman Kodak,
American Tobacco (merged with Brown and Williamson in 1994, which in turn

merged with RJ Reynolds in 2004), and Navistar International (formerly International
Harvester but became Navistar in 1986 when it sold its agricultural business). While
these companies are major corporations today with large market shares, some were
truly dominant firms by the end of the first merger wave. For example, U.S. Steel was not
the only corporation to dominate its market. American Tobacco enjoyed a 90% market
share, and Standard Oil, owned by J. D. Rockefeller, commanded 85% of its market.
In the first merger movement, there were 300 major combinations covering many
industrial areas and controlling 40% of the nation’s manufacturing capital. Nelson
estimates that in excess of 3,000 companies disappeared during this period as a result
of mergers.
By 1909, the 100 largest industrial corporations controlled nearly 18% of the
assets of all industrial corporations. Even the enactment of the Sherman Antitrust
Act (1890) did not impede this period of intense activity. The Justice Department was
largely responsible for the limited impact of the Sherman Act. During the period of
major consolidation of the early 1900s, the Justice Department, charged with enforcing
the Act, was understaffed and unable to aggressively pursue antitrust enforcement.
The agency’s activities were directed more toward labor unions. Therefore, the pace
of horizontal mergers and industry consolidations continued unabated without any
meaningful antitrust restrictions.
By the end of the first great merger wave, a marked increase in the degree of
concentration was evident in U.S. industry. The number of firms in some industries,
such as the steel industry, declined dramatically, and in some sectors only one firm
survived. It is ironic that monopolistic industries formed in light of the passage of the
Sherman Act. However, in addition to the Justice Department’s lack of resources, the
courts initially were unwilling to literally interpret the antimonopoly provisions of the
Act. For example, in 1895, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the American Sugar
Refining Company was not a monopoly and did not restrain trade.9 At this time, the
Supreme Court was not concerned by the fact that the Sugar Trust controlled 98% of
the sugar refining capacity in the United States. This favorable ruling gave the green
light to companies such as DuPont, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, International
Harvester, Standard Oil, and U.S. Steel to engage in M&As without being concerned
about legal interference.10 The courts initially saw the Sherman Act’s focus to be
on regulating stockholder trusts, in which investors would invest funds in a firm
and entrust their stock certificates to directors, who would ensure that they received
dividends for their “trust certificates.”
With a misguided focus on trusts, the law was not applied to hinder the formation
of monopolies in several industries in the first merger wave. The trusts were formed by
dominant business leaders, such as J. P. Morgan of the House of Morgan and John D.
Rockefeller of Standard Oil and National City Bank, as a response to the poor perfor-
mance of many of the nation’s businesses as they struggled with the weak economic

climate. They saw the structure of many industries, which included many small and
inefficient companies, as part of the reason for this poor performance. They reorganized
failing companies in various industries by forcing shareholders to exchange their equity
in troubled companies for trust certificates in a holding company that would control the
business in question but also many other competitors. With such control, J. P. Morgan
was able to rein in intense competition that he saw was rendering companies in many
industries weak. In doing so, he was able to give investors confidence in the soundness
of companies for which he and others were seeking to market securities. His main initial
focus was the railroad industry, which at that time accounted for the majority of stocks
traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Being an industry with large demands for cap-
ital, railroad companies aggressively marketed stocks and bonds through investment
bankersacrosstheUnitedStatesandEurope.However,railroadcompanieswereproneto
compete aggressively on rates and sought to drive each other to the brink of bankruptcy.
Morgan hated such unrestrained competition and sought to reorganize this industry,
and eventually others, using holding company trusts that would push aside aggres-
sive competitor managers and replace them with those who would preside over a more
orderly market. Morgan did not consider that consumers would suffer from these con-
solidations, as his focus was on investors who would seek to benefit.
Trusts grew and came to dominate many industries. Among them were the
American Cottonseed Oil Trust and the National Lead Trust, which dominated their
respective industries. Morgan Bank, in turn, controlled First National Bank, the
National Bank of Commerce, the First National Bank of Chicago, Liberty National Bank,
Chase National Bank, Hanover National Bank, and the Astor National Bank.11
In addition to lax enforcement of federal antitrust laws, other legal reasons explain
why the first merger wave thrived. For example, in some states, corporation laws were
gradually relaxed. In particular, corporations became better able to secure capital, hold
stock in other corporations, and expand their lines of business operations, thereby cre-
ating a fertile environment for firms to contemplate mergers. Greater access to capital
made it easier for firms to raise the necessary financing to carry out an acquisition,
and relaxed rules controlling the stockholdings of corporations allowed firms to acquire
stock in other companies with the purpose of acquiring the companies.
Not all states liberalized corporate laws. As a result, the pace of M&As was greater in
some states than in others. New Jersey, in which the passage of the New Jersey Holding
Company Act of 1888 helped liberalize state corporation laws, was the leading state in
M&As, followed by New York and Delaware. The law enabled holding company trusts
to be formed, and the State of New Jersey became a mecca for this corporate form. This
Act pressured other states to enact similar copycat legislation rather than see firms move
to reincorporate in New Jersey. Many firms, however, did choose to incorporate in New
Jersey, which explains the wide variety of New Jersey firms that participated in the first
merger wave. This trend declined dramatically by 1915, when the differences in state
corporation laws became less significant.

History of Mergers
The development of the U.S. transportation system was another of the major factors
that initiated the first merger wave. Following the Civil War, the establishment of a major
railway system helped create national rather than regional markets that firms could
potentially serve. Transcontinental railroads, such as the Union Pacific–Central Pacific,
which was completed in 1869, linked the western United States with the rest of the
country. Many firms, no longer viewing market potential as being limited by narrowly
defined market boundaries, expanded to take advantage of a now broader-based market.
Companies now facing competition from distant rivals chose to merge with local com-
petitors to maintain their market share. Changes in the national transportation system
made supplying distant markets both easier and less expensive. The cost of rail freight
transportation fell at an average rate of 3.7% per year from 1882 to 1900.12 In the
early 1900s, transportation costs increased very little despite a rising demand for trans-
portation services. It is interesting to note that the ability of U.S. railroads to continue to

ern railroad that he did not already own. Burlington Northern is actually a product of
390 different railroad M&As over the period 1850–2000. The development of the rail-
road system had widespread effects on the U.S. economy. For example, Donaldson and
Hornbeck showed how agricultural land values rose as the railroad system grew.13
Several other structural changes helped firms service national markets. For
example, the invention of the Bonsack continuous process cigarette machine enabled
the American Tobacco Company to supply the nation’s cigarette market with a relatively
small number of machines.14 As firms expanded, they exploited economies of scale in
production and distribution. For example, the Standard Oil Trust controlled 40% of the
world’s oil production by using only three refineries. It eliminated unnecessary plants
and thereby achieved greater efficiency.15 A similar process of expansion in the pursuit
of scale economies took place in many manufacturing industries in the U.S. economy
during this time. Companies and their managers began to study the production process
in an effort to enhance their ability to engage in ever-expanding mass production.16
The expansion of the scale of business also required greater managerial skills and led to
further specialization of management.
As mentioned, the first merger wave did not start until 1897, but the first great
takeover battle began much earlier—in 1868. Although the term takeover battle is
commonly used today to describe the sometimes acerbic conflicts among firms in
takeovers, it can be more literally applied to the conflicts that occurred in early
corporate mergers. One such takeover contest involved an attempt to take control of

the Erie Railroad in 1868. The takeover attempt pitted Cornelius Vanderbilt against
Daniel Drew, Jim Fisk, and Jay Gould. As one of their major takeover defenses, the
defenders of the Erie Railroad issued themselves large quantities of stock, in what is
known as a stock-watering campaign, even though they lacked the authorization to
do so.17 At that time, because bribery of judges and elected officials was common, legal
remedies for violating corporate laws were particularly weak. The battle for control of
the railroad took a violent turn when the target corporation hired guards, equipped
with firearms and cannons, to protect its headquarters. The takeover attempt ended
when Vanderbilt abandoned his assault on the Erie Railroad and turned his attention
to weaker targets.
In the late nineteenth century, as a result of such takeover contests, the public
became increasingly concerned about unethical business practices. Corporate laws
were not particularly effective during the 1890s. In response to many anti-railroad
protests, Congress established the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1897. The
Harrison, Cleveland, and McKinley administrations (1889–1901) were all very
pro-business and filled the commission with supporters of the very railroads they were
elected to regulate. Not until the passage of antitrust legislation in the late 1800s and
early 1900s, and tougher securities laws after the Great Depression, did the legal system
attain the necessary power to discourage unethical takeover tactics.
Lacking adequate legal restraints, the banking and business community adopted
its own voluntary code of ethical behavior. This code was enforced by an unwritten
agreement among investment bankers, who agreed to do business only with firms that
adhered to their higher ethical standards. Today Great Britain relies on such a volun-
tary code. Although these informal standards did not preclude all improper activities in
the pursuit of takeovers, they did set the stage for reasonable behavior during the first
takeover wave.
Financial factors rather than legal restrictions forced the end of the first merger
wave. First, the shipbuilding trust collapse in the early 1900s brought to the fore the
dangers of fraudulent financing. Second, and most important, the stock market crash
of 1904, followed by the banking Panic of 1907, closed many of the nation’s banks and
ultimately paved the way for the formation of the Federal Reserve System. As a result
of a declining stock market and a weak banking system, the basic financial ingredients
for fueling takeovers were absent. Without these, the first great takeover period came to
a halt. Some economic historians have interpreted the many horizontal combinations
that took place in the first wave as an attempt to achieve economies of scale. Through
M&As, the expanding companies sought to increase their efficiency by lower per-unit
costs. The fact that the majority of these mergers failed implies that these companies
were not successful in their pursuit of enhanced efficiency. Under President Theodore
Roosevelt, whose tenure in the executive office lasted from 1901 to 1909, the antitrust
environment steadily became more stringent. Although he did not play a significant role
in bringing an end to the first wave, Roosevelt, who came to be known as the trustbuster,
continued to try to exert pressure on anticompetitive activities.

History of Mergers
The government was initially unsuccessful in its antitrust lawsuits, but toward the
end of Roosevelt’s term in office it began to realize more success in the courtrooms. The
landmark Supreme Court decision in the 1904 Northern Securities case is an example
of the government’s greater success in bringing antitrust actions. Although President
Roosevelt holds the reputation of being the trustbuster, it was his successor, William
Howard Taft, who succeeded in breaking up some of the major trusts. It is ironic that
many of the companies formed in the breakup of the large trusts became very large busi-
nesses. For example, Standard Oil was broken up into companies such as Standard Oil of
New Jersey, which later became Exxon; Standard Oil of New York, which became Mobil
and merged with Exxon in 1998; Standard Oil of California, which rebranded under the
name Chevron, and acquired Gulf Oil in 1985, Texaco in 2001, and Unocal in 2005;
and Standard Oil of Indiana, which became Amoco, and was acquired by BP in 1998.
The mergers between some of the components of the old Standard Oil reflect the partial
undoing of this breakup as the petroleum market has been global, and these descendants
of J. D. Rockefeller’s old company now face much international competition.
SECOND WAVE, 1916–1929
George Stigler, the late Nobel Prize–winning economist and former professor at the
University of Chicago, contrasted the first and second merger waves as “merging
for monopoly” versus “merging for oligopoly.” During the second merger wave,
several industries were consolidated. Rather than monopolies, the result was often
an oligopolistic industry structure. The consolidation pattern established in the first
merger period continued into the second period. During this second period, the U.S.
economy continued to evolve and develop, primarily because of the post–World War I
economic boom, which provided much investment capital for eagerly waiting securities
markets. The availability of capital, which was fueled by favorable economic conditions
and lax margin requirements, set the stage for the stock market crash of 1929.
The antitrust environment of the 1920s was stricter than the environment that had
prevailed before the first merger wave. By 1910, Congress had become concerned about
the abuses of the market and the power wielded by monopolies. It also had become clear
that the Sherman Act was not an effective deterrent to monopoly. As a result, Congress
passed the Clayton Act in 1914, a law that reinforced the antimonopoly provisions of
the Sherman Act. (For a discussion of the Sherman and Clayton Acts, see Chapter 3.)
As the economy and the banking system rebounded in the late 1900s, this antitrust
law became a somewhat more important deterrent to monopoly. With a more strin-
gent antitrust environment, the second merger wave produced fewer monopolies but
more oligopolies and many vertical mergers. In addition, many companies in unrelated
industries merged. This was the first large-scale formation of conglomerates. However,
although these business combinations involved firms that did not directly produce the
same products, they often had similar product lines.

Third Wave, 1965–1969
◾
49
Armed with the Clayton and Sherman Acts, the U.S. government was in a better
position to engage in more effective antitrust enforcement than had occurred during
the first merger wave. Nonetheless, its primary focus remained on cracking down on
unfair business practices and preventing cartels or pools, as opposed to stopping anti-
competitive mergers. At this time, widespread price-fixing occurred in many industries,
which was thought to be a more pressing threat to competition than mergers, which
now were mainly vertical or conglomerate transactions. Just as in the first merger wave,
the second merger period witnessed the formation of many prominent corporations
that still operate today. These include General Motors, IBM, John Deere, and Union
Carbide.
THE 1940s
Before we proceed to a discussion of the third merger period, we will briefly examine
the mergers of the 1940s. During this decade, larger firms acquired smaller, privately
held companies for motives of tax relief. In this period of high estate taxes, the transfer
of businesses within families was very expensive; thus, the incentive to sell out to other
firms arose. These mergers did not result in increased concentration because most of
them did not represent a significant percentage of the total industry’s assets. Most of the
family business combinations involved smaller companies.
The 1940s did not feature any major technological changes or dramatic develop-
ment in the nation’s infrastructure. Thus, the increase in the number of mergers was
relatively small. Nonetheless, their numbers were still a concern to Congress, which
reacted by passing the Celler-Kefauver Act in 1950. This law strengthened Section 7
of the Clayton Act. (For further details on the Clayton Act, see the following section and
Chapter 3.)
THIRD WAVE, 1965–1969
The third merger wave featured a historically high level of merger activity. This was
brought about in part by a booming economy. During these years, often known as the
conglomerate merger period, it was not uncommon for relatively smaller firms to target
larger companies for acquisition. In contrast, during the two earlier waves, the major-
ity of the target firms were significantly smaller than the acquiring firms. Peter Steiner
reports that the acquisition of companies with assets over $100 million, which aver-
aged only 1.3 per year from 1948 to 1960, and 5 per year from 1961 to 1966, rose to
24 in 1967, 31 in 1968, 20 in 1969, and 12 in 1970. A large percent of the M&As
that took place in this period were conglomerate transactions. The Federal Trade Com-
mission (FTC) reported that 80% of the mergers that took place in the 10-year period
between 1965 and 1975 were conglomerate mergers.18

History of Mergers
The conglomerates formed during this period were more than merely diversified
in their product lines. The term diversified firms is generally applied to companies that
have some subsidiaries in other industries but a majority of their production within one
industry category. Unlike diversified firms, conglomerates conduct a large percentage of
their business activities in different industries. Good examples are Ling-Temco-Vought
(LTV), Litton Industries, and ITT. In the 1960s, ITT acquired such diverse businesses as
Avis Rent A Car, Sheraton Hotels, Continental Baking, and other far-flung enterprises,
such as restaurant chains, consumer credit agencies, home building companies, and
airport parking firms. Although the third merger wave is associated with well-known
conglomerate firms such as ITT and LTV, many corporations of varying sizes engaged in
a diversification strategy. Many small and medium-sized firms also followed this fad and
moved into areas outside their core business.
As firms with the necessary financial resources sought to expand, they faced
tougher antitrust enforcement. The heightened antitrust atmosphere of the 1960s
was an outgrowth of the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950, which had strengthened
the antimerger provisions of the Clayton Act of 1914. The Clayton Act made the
acquisition of other firms’ stock illegal when the acquisition resulted in a merger that
significantly reduced the degree of competition within an industry. However, the law
had an important loophole: It did not preclude the anticompetitive acquisition of a
firm’s assets. The Celler-Kefauver Act closed this loophole. Armed with tougher laws,
the federal government adopted a stronger antitrust stance, coming down hard on
both horizontal and vertical mergers. Expansion-minded firms found that their only
available alternative was to form conglomerates.
With the election of Richard M. Nixon in 1969, Washington policymakers advo-
catedafreermarketorientation.Nixonsupportedthispolicythroughhisfourappointees
to the U.S. Supreme Court, who espoused a broader interpretation of concepts such as
market share. The tough antitrust enforcement of the Justice Department came to an
end in 1972, as the Supreme Court failed to accept the Justice Department’s interpre-
tation of antitrust laws. For example, in some cases the Supreme Court began to use a
broad international market view as opposed to a more narrow domestic or even regional
market definition. Consequently, if as a result of a merger, a firm had a large percentage
of the U.S. market or a region of the nation but a small percentage of the international
market, it could be judged to lack significant monopolistic characteristics. By this time,
however, the third merger wave had already come to an end.
Industry Concentration and the Conglomerate Wave
Because most of the mergers in the third wave involved the formation of conglomerates
rather than vertical or horizontal mergers, they did not appreciably increase industrial
concentration. For this reason, the degree of competition in different industries did not
significantly change despite the large number of mergers. Some 6,000 mergers, entail-
ing the disappearance of 25,000 firms, took place; nonetheless, competition, or market
concentration, in the U.S. economy was not greatly reduced. This clearly contrasts with
the first merger wave, which resulted in a dramatic increase in industry concentration
in many industries.

Shareholder Wealth Effects of Diversiﬁcation during
the Conglomerate Wave
In Chapter 4 we critically examine diversification strategies and their impact on share-
holder wealth. However, while we are discussing the conglomerate wave, it is useful to
briefly address some research that has attempted to assess the impact of these types of
deals on shareholder wealth. Henri Servaes analyzed a large sample of firms over the
years 1961–1976.19 He showed that over this time period, the average number of busi-
ness segments in which firms operated increased from 1.74 in 1961 to 2.7 in 1976. He
thenexaminedtheQratios(ratiosofthemarketvalueofsecuritiesdividedbythereplace-
ment value of assets) of the companies in his sample and found that diversified firms
were valued at a discount—even during the third merger wave when such diversifying
deals were so popular. He found, however, that this diversification discount declined over
time. Servaes analyzed the assertion that insiders derive private benefits from managing
a diversified firm, which may subject the firm to less risk although at a cost that may not
be in shareholders’ interests. If managers derive private benefits that come at a cost to
shareholders (the discount), then this may explain why companies with higher insider
ownership were focused when the discount was high but began to diversify when the dis-
count declined. At least they did not pursue their private benefits when it was imposing
a cost on shareholders.
Some research shows that the stock market response to diversifying acquisitions in
the conglomerate was positive.20 Matsusaka found that not only did the market respond
positively, but also the response was clearly positive when bidders agreed to keep target
management in place and negative when management was replaced as in disciplinary
takeovers. While this may have been the case, this does not mean that the market’s
response in this time period to these diversifying deals was correct. When one considers
the track record of many of these deals, it is easy to conclude that they were flawed. Later
researchcovering morerecent time periodsshowsthat themarket may havelearned this
lesson, and such deals do not meet with a favorable response.
Price–Earnings Game and the Incentive to Merge
As mentioned previously, investment bankers did not finance most of the mergers in
the 1960s, as they had in the two previous merger waves. Tight credit markets and high
interest rates were the concomitants of the higher credit demands of an expanding econ-
omy. As the demand for loanable funds rose, both the price of these funds and interest
rates increased. In addition, the booming stock market prices provided equity financing
for many of the conglomerate takeovers.
The bull market of the 1960s bid stock prices higher and higher. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average, which was 618 in 1960, rose to 906 in 1968. As their stock
prices skyrocketed, investors were especially interested in growth stocks. Potential

History of Mergers
bidders soon learned that acquisitions, financed by stocks, could be an excellent
“pain-free” way to raise earnings per share without incurring higher tax liabilities.
Mergers financed through stock transactions may not be taxable. For this reason,
stock-financed acquisitions had an advantage over cash transactions, which were
subject to taxation.
Companies played the price–earnings ratio game to justify their expansionist activ-
ities. The price–earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio of the market price of a firm’s stock
divided by the earnings available to common stockholders on a per-share basis. The
higher the P/E ratio, the more investors are willing to pay for a firm’s stock given their
expectations about the firm’s future earnings. High P/E ratios for the majority of stocks
in the market indicate widespread investor optimism; Such was the case in the bull mar-
ket of the 1960s. These high stock values helped finance the third merger wave. Mergers
inspired by P/E ratio effects can be illustrated as follows.
Let us assume that the acquiring firm is larger than the target firm with which it
is considering merging. In addition, assume that the larger firm has a P/E ratio of 25:1
and annual earnings of $1 million, with 1 million shares outstanding. Each share sells
for $25. The target firm has a lower P/E ratio of 10:1 and annual earnings of $100,000,
with 100,000 shares outstanding. This firm’s stock sells for $10. The larger firm offers
the smaller firm a premium on its stock to entice its stockholders to sell. This premium
comes in the form of a stock-for-stock offer in which one share of the larger firm, worth
$25, is offered for two shares of the smaller firm, worth a total of $20. The large firm
issues 50,000 shares to finance the purchase.
This acquisition causes the earnings per share (EPS) of the higher P/E firm to rise.
The EPS of the higher P/E firm has risen from $1.00 to $1.05. We can see the effect on
the price of the larger firm’s stock if we make the crucial assumption that its P/E ratio
stays the same. This implies that the market will continue to value this firm’s future
earnings in a manner similar to the way it did before the acquisition. The validity of this
type of assumption is examined in greater detail in Chapter 15.
Based on the assumption that the P/E ratio of the combined firm remains at 25, the
stock price will rise to 26.25 (25 × $1.05). We can see that the larger firm can offer the
smaller firm a significant premium while its EPS and stock price rise. This process can
continue with other acquisitions, which also result in further increases in the acquir-
ing company’s stock price. This process will end if the market decides not to apply the
same P/E ratio. A bull market such as occurred in the 1960s helps promote high P/E
values. When the market falls, however, as it did at the end of the 1960s, this process
is not feasible. The process of acquisitions, based on P/E effects, becomes increasingly
untenable as a firm seeks to apply it to successively larger firms. The crucial assumption
in creating the expectation that stock prices will rise is that the P/E ratio of the high P/E
firm will apply to the combined entity. However, as the targets become larger and larger,
the target becomes a more important percentage of the combined firm’s earning power.
After a company acquires several relatively lower P/E firms, the market becomes reluc-
tant to apply the original higher P/E ratio. Therefore, it becomes more difficult to find
target firms that will not decrease the acquirer’s stock price. As the number of suitable

acquisition candidates declines, the merger wave slows down. Therefore, a merger wave
based on such “finance gimmickry” can last only a limited time period before it exhausts
itself, as this one did.
With its bull market and the formation of huge conglomerates, the term the go-go
years was applied to the 1960s.21 When the stock market fell in 1969, it affected the
pace of acquisitions by reducing P/E ratios.
Accounting Manipulations and the Incentive to Merge
Under accounting rules that prevailed at the time, acquirers had the opportunity to
generate paper gains when they acquired companies that had assets on their books that
were well below their market values. The gains were recorded when an acquirer sold
off certain of these assets. To illustrate such an accounting manipulation, A. J. Briloff
recounts how Gulf & Western generated earnings in 1967 by selling off the films of
Paramount Pictures, which it had acquired in 1966.22 The bulk of Paramount’s assets
were in the form of feature films, which it listed on its books at a value significantly less
than their market value. In 1967, Gulf & Western sold 32 of the films of its Paramount
subsidiary. This generated significant “income” for Gulf & Western in 1967, which suc-
ceeded in supporting Gulf & Western’s stock price.
Another artificial incentive that encouraged conglomerate acquisitions involved
securities, such as convertible debentures, which were used to finance acquisitions.
Acquiring firms would issue convertible debentures in exchange for common stock
of the target firm. This allowed them to receive the short-term benefit of adding the
target’s earnings to its EPS valuation while putting off the eventual increase in the
acquirer’s shares outstanding.
Decline of the Third Merger Wave
The decline of the conglomerates may be first traced to the announcement by Litton
Industries in 1968 that its quarterly earnings declined for the first time in 14 years.23
Although Litton’s earnings were still positive, the market turned sour on conglomerates,
and the selling pressure on their stock prices increased.
In 1968, Attorney General Richard McLaren announced that he intended to crack
down on the conglomerates, which he believed were an anticompetitive influence on
the market. Various legal changes were implemented to limit the use of convertible debt
to finance acquisitions. The 1969 Tax Reform Act required that convertible debt be
treated as equity for EPS calculations while also restricting changes in the valuation of
undervalued assets of targets. The conglomerate boom came to an end, and this helped
collapse the stock market.

History of Mergers
Performance of Conglomerates
Little evidence exists to support the advisability of many of the conglomerate acqui-
sitions. Buyers often overpaid for the diverse companies they purchased. Many of the
acquisitions were followed by poor financial performance. This is confirmed by the fact
that 60% of the cross-industry acquisitions that occurred between 1970 and 1982 were
sold or divested by 1989.
There is no conclusive explanation for why conglomerates failed. Economic theory,
however, points out the productivity-enhancing effects of increased specialization.
Indeed, this has been the history of capitalism since the Industrial Revolution. The
conglomerate era represented a movement away from specialization. Managers of
diverse enterprises often had little detailed knowledge of the specific industries that were
under their control. This is particularly the case when compared with the management
expertise and attention that are applied by managers who concentrate on one industry
or even one segment of an industry. It is not surprising, therefore, that a company like
Revlon, a firm that has an established track record of success in the cosmetics industry,
saw its core cosmetics business suffer when it diversified into unrelated areas, such as
health care.
TRENDSETTING MERGERS OF THE 1970s
The number of M&A announcements declined during the 1970s. Even so, the decade
played a major role in merger history. Several path-breaking mergers changed what
was considered to be acceptable takeover behavior in the years to follow. The first of
these mergers was the International Nickel Company (INCO) acquisition of ESB (for-
merly known as Electric Storage Battery Company).
INCO versus ESB
After the third merger wave, a historic merger paved the way for a type that would be
pervasive in the fourth wave: the hostile takeover by major established companies.
In 1974, Philadelphia-based ESB was the largest battery maker in the world,
specializing in automobile batteries under the Willard and Exide brand names as well
as other consumer batteries under the Ray-O-Vac brand name. Although the firm’s
profits had been rising, its stock price had fallen in response to a generally declining
stock market. Several companies had expressed an interest in acquiring ESB, but
all these efforts were rebuffed. On July 18, 1974, INCO announced a tender offer to
acquire all outstanding shares of ESB for $28 per share, for a total of $157 million. The
Toronto-based INCO controlled approximately 40% of the world’s nickel market and was
by far the largest firm in this industry. Competition in the nickel industry had increased
in the previous 10 years while demand proved to be increasingly volatile. In an effort to
smooth their cash flows, INCO sought an acquisition target that was less cyclical.
INCO ultimately selected ESB as the appropriate target for several reasons. As part of
what INCO considered to be the “energy industry,” ESB was attractive in light of the high

oil prices that prevailed at that time. While it featured name brands, ESB was also not
in the forefront of innovation and was losing ground to competitors, such as Eveready
and Duracell.
Because the takeover was an unfriendly acquisition, INCO did not have the benefit of
a detailed financial analysis using internal data. Before INCO acquired ESB, major rep-
utable corporations did not participate in unfriendly takeovers; only smaller firms and
less respected speculators engaged in such activity. If a major firm’s takeover overtures
were rebuffed, the acquisition was discontinued. Moreover, most large investment banks
refused to finance hostile takeovers.
At this time, the level of competition that existed in investment banking was putting
pressure on the profits of Morgan Stanley, INCO’s investment banker. Although it was
seeking additional sources of profits, Morgan Stanley was also concerned that by refus-
ing to aid INCO in its bid for ESB, it might lose a long-term client. Morgan Stanley, long
known as a conservative investment bank, reluctantly began to change posture as it
saw its market share erode because of the increasingly aggressive advance of its rivals in
the investment banking business. Underwriting, which had constituted 95% of its busi-
ness until 1965, had become less profitable as other investment banks challenged the
traditional relationships of the underwriting business by making competitive bids when
securities were being underwritten.24
Many banks, seeking other areas of profitability, expanded their trading operations.
By the 1980s, trading would displace underwriting as the investment bank’s key
profit center.25 This situation would change once again toward the end of the 1980s,
as fees related to M&As became an increasingly important part of some investment
banks’ revenues.
ESB found itself unprepared for a hostile takeover, given the novelty of this type of
action. INCO gave it only a three-hour warning of its “take it or leave it” offer. ESB had
installed some antitakeover defenses, but they were ineffective. It sought help from the
investment bank of Goldman Sachs, which tried to arrange a friendly takeover by United
Aircraft, but by September 1974, INCO’s hostile takeover of ESB was completed.26 The
takeover of ESB proved to be a poor investment, primarily because INCO, as a result of
legal actions associated with antitrust considerations, was not given a free hand to man-
age the company. Not until 39 months after INCO had completed the acquisition did it
attain the right to exercise free control over the company. Moreover, as noted previously,
ESB’s competitors were already aggressively marketing superior products. By 1981, ESB
was reporting operating losses; INCO eventually sold it in four separate parts. INCO

History of Mergers
continued to be the world leader in the nickel business. Interestingly, it stepped into the
role of white knight in 2006, when it made a bid for Canadian Falconbridge, a leading
copper, nickel, and zinc producer, which was the target of an unwanted 2005 bid from
the Swiss mining company Xstrata. This led to a long and complicated takeover bat-
tle involving several companies. Eventually, INCO was acquired for approximately $17
billion by the world’s largest producer of iron ore, Brazilian company CVRD.
Although the ESB acquisition was not financially successful, it was precedent-
setting. It set the stage for hostile takeovers by respected companies in the second
half of the 1970s and through the fourth merger wave of the 1980s. This previously
unacceptable action—the hostile takeover by a major industrial firm with the support
of a leading investment banker—now gained legitimacy. The word hostile now became
part of the vocabulary of M&As. “‘ESB is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made
by a foreign company for all of ESB’s shares,’ said F. J. Port, ESB’s president. ‘Hostile’
thus entered the mergers and acquisitions lexicon.”27
While the INCO-ESB deal was precedent setting in the U.S. market as it was the first
hostile takeover by a major corporation and supported by a major investment bank, it
was not the first hostile takeover. As we have already noted, such deals were attempted
in the United States in the 1800s. In Europe, the first major hostile deal appears to be the
1956 takeover of British Aluminum by Reynolds Metal and Tube Investments. This deal,
known as the “aluminum war,” was engineered by the then-up-and-coming investment
bank S. G. Warburg.28
United Technologies versus Otis Elevator
As suggested previously, following INCO’s hostile takeover of ESB, other major corpo-
rations began to consider unfriendly acquisitions. Firms and their chief executives who
were inclined to be raiders but inhibited by censure from the business community now
became unrestrained. United Technologies was one such firm.
In 1975, United Technologies had recently changed its name from United Aircraft
through the efforts of its chairman, Harry Gray, and president, Edward Hennessy, who
were transforming the company into a growing conglomerate. They were familiar with
the INCO-ESB acquisition, having participated in the bidding war for ESB as the unsuc-
cessful white knight that Goldman Sachs had solicited on ESB’s behalf. Up until the bid
for Otis, United had never participated in a hostile acquisition.
At that time, the growth of the elevator manufacturing business was slowing down
and its sales patterns were cyclical inasmuch as it was heavily dependent on the con-
struction industry. Nonetheless, this target was extremely attractive. One-third of Otis’s
revenues came from servicing elevators, revenues that tend to be much more stable than
those from elevator construction. That Otis was a well-managed company made it all
the more appealing to United Technologies. Moreover, 60% of Otis’s revenues were from
international customers, a detail that fit well with United Technologies’ plans to increase

itsinternationalpresence.BybuyingOtisElevator,Unitedcoulddiversifyinternationally
while buying an American firm and not assuming the normal risk that would be present
with the acquisition of a foreign company.
United initially attempted friendly overtures toward Otis, which were not accepted.
On October 15, 1975, United Technologies bid $42 per share for a controlling interest
in Otis Elevator, an offer that precipitated a heated battle between the two firms. Otis
sought the aid of a white knight, the Dana Corporation, an auto parts supplier, while
filing several lawsuits to enjoin United from completing its takeover. A bidding war that
ensued between United Technologies and the Dana Corporation ended with United win-
ning with a bid of $44 per share. Unlike the INCO-ESB takeover, however, the takeover of
Otis proved to be an excellent investment of United’s excess cash. Otis went on to enjoy
greater-than-expected success, particularly in international markets.
United’s takeover of Otis was a groundbreaking acquisition; not only was it a hostile
takeover by an established firm, but also it was a successful venture and Otis remains a
valuable part of United today. This deal helped make hostile takeovers acceptable.
Colt Industries versus Garlock Industries
Colt Industries’ takeover of Garlock Industries was yet another precedent-setting acqui-
sition, moving hostile takeovers to a sharply higher level of hostility. The other two hos-
tile takeovers by major firms had amounted to heated bidding wars but were mild in
comparison to the aggressive tactics used in this takeover.
In 1964, the Fairbanks Whitney Company changed its name to Colt Industries,
which was the firearms company it had acquired in 1955. During the 1970s, the
company was almost totally restructured, with Chairman George Strichman and
President David Margolis divesting the firm of many of its poorly performing businesses.
The management wanted to use the cash from these sales to acquire higher-growth
industrial businesses. As part of this acquisition program, in 1975, Colt initiated a
hostile bid for Garlock Industries, which manufactured packing and sealing products.
The deal was pathbreaking due to the fact that Garlock fought back furiously and
aggressively by using public relations as part of its defensive arsenal. Colt responded
in kind and eventually acquired Garlock. This deal is notable for making hostile deals
truly hostile. Such deals are commonplace today.
LING-TEMCO-VOUGHT: GROWTH OF A
CONGLOMERATEa
L
ing-Temco-Vought (LTV) Corporation was one of the leading conglomerates of
the third merger wave. The company was led by James Joseph Ling—the Ling
of Ling-Temco-Vought. The story of how he parlayed a $2,000 investment and a
small electronics business into the fourteenth-largest industrial company in the
United States is a fascinating one. Ling-Temco-Vought was a sprawling industrial
(continued )

(continued )
corporation, which at its peak included such major enterprises as Jones & Laughlin
Steel, the nation’s sixth-largest steel company; Wilson & Co., a major meat packing
and sporting goods company; Braniff Airways, an airline that serviced many domestic
and international routes; Temco and Vought Aircraft, both suppliers of aircraft for
the military; and several other companies. The company originated in a small Texas
electrical contracting business that Jimmy Ling grew, through a pattern of diverse
acquisitions, into one of the largest U.S. corporations. The original corporate entity,
the Ling Electric Company, was started in 1947 with a modest investment of $2,000,
which was used to buy war surplus electrical equipment and a used truck. By
1956, Ling Electronics had enjoyed steady growth and embarked on one of its
ﬁrst acquisitions by buying L. M. Electronics. Various other electronic and defense
contractors were then acquired, including the American Microwave Corporation,
the United Electronics Company, and the Calidyne Company. Acquisitions such as
these—companies that lacked the requisite capital to expand—were ﬁnanced by
Ling through a combination of debt and stock in his company, which traded on the
over-the-counter market.
By 1958, this master dealmaker sold an offering of convertible debentures in a
private placement that was arranged by the Wall Street investment bank of White
Weld & Company. This type of securities offering was particularly popular with the
dealmakers of the third wave because it did not have an immediate adverse impact
on earnings per share, thus leaving the company in a good position to play the
“proﬁts/earnings game.” With its stock price trading in the $40s, Ling started the
process of buying targets that were much bigger than the acquiring company with
the 1958 stock-for-stock acquisition of Altec Companies, a manufacturer of sound
systems.
After some other small acquisitions, Ling initiated his largest acquisition when
he merged his company with the Texas Engineering and Manufacturing Company,
Temco. This deal enabled Ling to accomplish a long-term goal when the merged
company, Ling-Temco Electronics, became part of the Fortune 500. Shortly there-
after, Ling prevailed in a hostile takeover of the Vought Aircraft Company to form
Ling-Temco-Vought.
Ling-Temco-Vought went through a period of lackluster ﬁnancial performance,
which forced Ling to restructure the company by selling off poorly performing
divisions. In 1967, Ling successfully completed a tender offer for Wilson & Company,
a ﬁrm twice the size of LTV. This deal vaulted LTV to number 38 on the Fortune
500 list. Wilson was composed of three subsidiaries: Wilson & Company, the
meat-packing business; Wilson Sporting Goods; and the Wilson Pharmaceutical
and Chemical Corporation. Traders sometimes referred to these divisions as “meat-
ball, golf ball, and goof ball.” The next step Ling took in assembling this massive
conglomerate was to buy the Great America Corporation, which was a holding
company with investments in a variety of businesses, such as Braniff Airlines and
National Car Rental, as well as banks and insurance companies. Although few ben-
eﬁcial commonalities appeared to be associated with this acquisition, Ling was able
to exploit several, such as the insurance companies’ writing insurance for a variety
of LTV units and employees.
After an unsuccessful takeover of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company,
Ling set his sights on the fourth-largest steel producer in the United States, Jones
& Laughlin Steel. Ling-Temco-Vought bought Jones & Laughlin in an $85 tender
offer for a company with a preannouncement price of $50. This $425 million bid was

the largest cash tender offer as of that date and represented a 70% premium for a
company in a low-growth industry.
Unfortunately, the takeover of Jones & Laughlin drew the ire of Assistant
Attorney General Richard McLaren, who saw it as another anticompetitive con-
glomerate acquisition. The Justice Department ﬁled an antitrust lawsuit, which was
bad news for any defendant because the government won a very high percentage
of such cases. The market seemed to concur with this legal assessment because
the stock price declined after the announcement. Because of the lawsuit, LTV was
prevented from playing an active role in the management of Jones & Laughlin
and taking steps to turn around the poorly performing steel company that had just
announced its worst earnings performance in a decade. With the addition of Jones
& Laughlin, LTV now had two major components of its empire—Braniff Airlines being
the other one—reporting sizable losses. A settlement of the lawsuit was reached
in which LTV agreed to sell off Braniff and the Okonite Company, a cable and wire
manufacturer.
Although LTV was able to achieve a favorable settlement, its stock suffered,
partly as a result of the lawsuit, the poor performance of its subsidiaries, and the
overall decline in the market. These factors gave rise to pressures from dissident
shareholders and bondholders to remove Ling from control of LTV. Ling was not able
to survive these pressures; he was demoted from his position as chief executive and
eventually left LTV. The story of Jimmy Ling and the huge conglomerate that he built
is one of a man who was ahead of his time. He was probably the most renowned
of the great conglomerate builders of the third merger wave. Whereas the 1980s
featured such raiders as Carl Icahn and Boone Pickens, Ling was joined in the third
wave by other conglomerators, such as Laurence Tisch of Loews, Charles Bluhdorn
of Gulf & Western, and Ben Heineman of Northwest Industries. Long before the
1980s, Ling had mastered the art of the LBO and hostile takeover. Unlike many of
the raiders of the 1980s, however, Ling was opposed to trying to turn a quick proﬁt
on acquisitions by selling off assets. He bought companies with a more long-term
strategy in mind, which, nonetheless, many criticized.
What was once LTV has undergone many changes since the 1960s. The company
experienced ﬁnancial troubles in the 1980s, as did many companies in the U.S. steel
industry. It was acquired in 2002 by Wilber Ross, who rolled the company into the
International Steel Group. Ross then sold this company to Mittal in 2004.

FOURTH WAVE, 1984–1989
The downward trend that characterized M&As in the 1970s through 1980 reversed
sharply in 1981. Although the pace of mergers slowed again in 1982 as the economy
weakened, a strong merger wave had taken hold by 1984. Figure 2.1 shows the number
of M&A announcements for the period from 1970 to 2016. The unique characteristic
of the fourth wave is the significant role of hostile mergers. As noted previously,
hostile mergers had become an acceptable form of corporate expansion by the 1980s,
and the corporate raid had gained status as a highly profitable speculative activity.

Consequently, corporations and speculative partnerships played the takeover game as a
means of enjoying very high profits in a short time. Whether takeovers are considered
friendly or hostile generally is determined by the reaction of the target company’s board
of directors. If the board approves the takeover, it is considered friendly; if the board is
opposed, the takeover is deemed hostile.
Although the absolute number of hostile takeovers in the fourth merger wave was
not high with respect to the total number of takeovers, the relative percentage of hostile
takeovers in the total value of takeovers rose during the fourth wave.
The fourth merger period may also be distinguished from the other three waves
by the size and prominence of the M&A targets. Some of the nation’s largest firms
became targets of acquisition during the 1980s. The fourth wave became the wave
of the megamerger. The total dollar value paid in acquisitions rose sharply during
this decade. In addition to the rise in the dollar value of mergers, the average size of
the typical transaction increased significantly. This was a major difference from the
conglomerate era of the 1960s, in which the acquisition of small and medium-sized
businesses predominated. The 1980s became the period of the billion-dollar M&As. The
leading megamergers of the fourth wave are shown in Table 2.1.
M&A volume was clearly greater in certain industries. The oil industry, for example,
experienced more than its share of mergers, which resulted in a greater degree of con-
centration within that industry. The oil and gas industry accounted for 21.6% of the
total dollar value of M&As from 1981 to 1985. During the second half of the 1980s,
drugs and medical equipment deals were the most common. One reason some industries
experienced a disproportionate number of M&As as compared with other industries was
deregulation. When the airline industry was deregulated, for example, airfares became
subject to greater competition, causing the competitive position of some air carriers to

deteriorate. The result was numerous acquisitions and a consolidation of this industry.
The banking and petroleum industries experienced a similar pattern of competitively
inspired M&As.
Role of the Corporate Raider
In the fourth wave, the term corporate raider made its appearance in the vernacular of
corporate finance. The corporate raider’s main source of income is the proceeds from
takeover attempts. The word attempt is the curious part of this definition, because the
raider frequently earned handsome profits from acquisition attempts without ever
taking ownership of the targeted corporation. The corporate raider Paul Bilzerian, for
example, participated in numerous raids before his acquisition of the Singer Corporation
in 1988. Although he earned significant profits from these raids, he did not complete a
single major acquisition until Singer.
Many of the takeover attempts by raiders were ultimately designed to sell the target
shares at a higher price than that which the raider originally paid. The ability of raiders
to receive greenmail payments (or some of the target’s valued assets) in exchange for the
stock that the raider has already acquired made many hostile takeover attempts quite
profitable. Even if a target refuses to participate in such transactions, the raider may
succeed in putting the company “in play.” When a target goes into play, the stock tends
to be concentrated in the hands of arbitragers, who readily sell to the highest bidder. This
process often results in a company eventually being taken over, although not necessarily
by the original bidder.
Although arbitrage is a well-established practice, the role of M&A arbitragers
in the takeover process did not become highly refined until the fourth merger wave.

62
◾
History of Mergers
Arbitragers such as the infamous Ivan Boesky gambled on the likelihood of a merger
being consummated. They would buy the stock of the target in anticipation of a bid
being made for the company.
Arbitragers became a very important part of the takeover process during the 1980s.
Their involvement changed the strategy of takeovers. Moreover, the development of
this “industry” helped facilitate the rising number of hostile takeovers that occurred in
those years.
In the 2000s we do not have corporate raiders such as those who attacked compa-
nies in the fourth merger wave. However, the modern version of these raiders is today’s
activist hedge funds, which we discuss in Chapter 7.
Other Unique Characteristics of the Fourth Wave
The fourth merger wave featured several other interesting and unique character-
istics. These features sharply differentiated this time from any other period in U.S.
merger history.
Aggressive Role of Investment Bankers
The aggressiveness of investment bankers in pursuing M&As was crucial to the growth
of the fourth wave. In turn, mergers were a great source of virtually risk-free advisory
fees for investment bankers. The magnitude of these fees reached unprecedented
proportions during this period. Merger specialists at both investment banks and law
firms developed many innovative products and techniques designed to facilitate or
prevent takeovers. They pressured both potential targets and acquirers into hiring
them either to bring about or to prevent takeovers. Partially to help finance takeovers,
the investment bank of Drexel Burnham Lambert pioneered the development and
growth of the junk bond market. These previously lowly regarded securities became
an important investment vehicle for financing many takeovers. Junk bond financing
enabled expansionist firms and raiders to raise the requisite capital to contemplate
acquisitions or raids on some of the more prominent corporations.
Increased Sophistication of Takeover Strategies
The fourth merger wave featured innovative acquisition techniques and investment
vehicles. Offensive and defensive strategies became highly intricate. Potential targets
set in place various preventative antitakeover measures to augment the active defenses
they could deploy in the event that they received an unwanted bid. Bidders also had
to respond with increasingly more creative takeover strategies to circumvent such
defenses. These antitakeover strategies are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.
More Aggressive Use of Debt
Many of the megadeals of the 1980s were financed with large amounts of debt. This
was one of the reasons small companies were able to make bids for comparatively larger
targets. During this period the term leveraged buyout (LBO) became part of the vernacular

Fourth Wave, 1984–1989
◾
63
of Wall Street. Through LBOs, debt may be used to take public companies private. It often
was the company’s own management that used this technique in management buyouts.
Although public corporations had been brought private before the fourth wave, this type
of transaction became much more prominent during the 1980s.
Legal and Political Strategies
During this period, new conflicts arose between the federal and state governments.
Besieged corporations increasingly looked to their state governments for protection
against unwanted acquisition offers. They often were able to persuade local legislatures
to pass antitakeover legislation, which brought the federal and state governments into
direct conflict. Some representatives of the federal government, such as the Securities
and Exchange Commission, believed that these laws were an infringement of interstate
commerce. For their part, some state governments believed that such laws were based
on their constitutionally granted state rights. Clearly, however, some state governments
became protectors of indigenous corporations.
International Takeovers
Although most of the takeovers in the United States in the 1980s involved U.S. firms
taking over other domestic companies, foreign bidders affected a significant percentage
of takeovers, although nothing compared to what would take place in the fifth and
sixth merger waves. An example of one of the international megadeals of the fourth
wave was the 1987 acquisition of Standard Oil of Ohio(Sohio) by British Petroleum
for $7.8 billion. Many of the deals were motivated by non-U.S. companies seeking to
expand into the larger and more stable U.S. market. In addition to the normal consid-
erations that are involved in domestic acquisitions, foreign takeovers also introduce
currency valuation issues. If the dollar falls against other currencies, as it did in the
1990s relative to many currencies, stock in U.S. corporations declines in value and the
purchasing value of foreign currencies rises. A falling dollar may make U.S. acquisitions
attractive investments for Japanese or European companies. The increased globalization
of markets in the 1980s and 1990s brought foreign bidders to U.S. shores in increased
numbers. Although U.S. companies may also engage in acquisitions in foreign markets,
as many have, a falling dollar makes such acquisitions more expensive.
Role of Deregulation
Certain industries were deregulated during the 1980s. Mitchell and Mulherin analyzed
a sample of 1,064 M&As and other restructurings over the period 1982–1989.29 They
found that in industries that had undergone significant federal deregulation, such as
air transport, broadcasting, entertainment, natural gas, and trucking, this deregulation
was found to be a significant causal factor. They also noticed that all industries did not
respond to deregulation in the same way. For example, the response in broadcasting was
quicker than in air transport.

Activity,” Journal of Financial Economics 41, no. 2 (June 1996): 193–229.

History of Mergers
Why the Fourth Merger Wave Ended
The fourth merger wave ended in 1989 as the long economic expansion of the 1980s
came to an end and the economy went into a brief and relatively mild recession in 1990.
The economic slowdown led to the unraveling of a number of the high-profile leveraged
deals of the fourth wave. In addition to the overall slowdown in the economy, other fac-
tors that led to the end of the wave included the collapse of the junk bond market, which
had provided the financing for many of the LBOs of the period.
FIFTH WAVE, 1992–2001
Starting in 1992, the number of M&As once again began to increase (Figure 2.2). Large
deals, some similar in size to those that occurred in the fourth merger wave, began to
occur once again. At this time, the track record of many of the highly leveraged deals of
the fourth wave, some of which were still in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, was quite apparent.
Managers vowed they would not duplicate the mistakes of the 1980s and focused more

on strategic deals that did not unduly rely on leverage. Short-term, purely financial plays
were also avoided. This all seemed to go according to plan—at least for a while.
During the 1990s, the U.S. economy entered into its longest postwar expansion, and
companies reacted to the increased aggregate demand by pursuing M&As, which are a
faster way to grow than internal growth. At the same time, the stock market values of
companies took off and various market indexes reached new highs (Figure 2.3).
While the expanding economy required that there be some adjustment in expected
profitability, the high levels of the market became difficult to explain. We will revisit this
issue a little later in this chapter.
Although the fifth merger wave featured many large megamergers, there were
fewer hostile high-profile deals and more strategic mergers occurred. As the economy
recovered from the mild 1990–1991 recession, companies began to seek to expand
and mergers once again were seen as a quick and efficient manner in which to do
that. Unlike the deals of the 1980s, however, the initial transactions of the 1990s
emphasized strategy more than quick financial gains. These deals were not the
debt-financed bust-up transactions of the fourth merger wave. Rather, many were
financed through the increased use of equity, which resulted in less heavily leveraged
combinations.

History of Mergers
Industry Concentration during the Fifth Wave
Certain industries accounted for a disproportionate share of the total dollar volume of
M&As in the United States during the fifth merger wave. In particular, banking and
finance and communications and broadcasting accounted for 26.5% of all U.S. deals
over the period 1993–2004. However, the percentage accounted for in these industries
rose from a low of 7.5% in 1994 to a high of 41.9% of deals in 1999. This was caused
by a combination of factors, including the continued impact of deregulation and con-
solidation of the banking industry, as well as the dramatic changes that were ongoing in
telecom and Internet-related businesses. The fifth wave would have been different had
it not been for the “inflating” yet short-lived impact of these sectors.
Fad of the Fifth Merger Wave: Roll-Ups and Consolidations
of Industries
Each wave brought with it certain uniquely different transactions, and the fifth wave
was no exception. In the mid-1990s, the market became enthralled with consolidating
deals—what were called roll-ups. Here fragmented industries were consolidated through
larger-scale acquisitions of companies that were called consolidators. Certain invest-
ment banks specialized in roll-ups; they were able to get financing and were issuing stock
in these consolidated companies. Roll-ups were concentrated in particular businesses,
such as funeral printing, office products, bus transportation, and floral products.
The strategy behind roll-ups was to combine smaller companies into a national
business and enjoy economies of scale while gaining the benefits of being able to market
to national as opposed to regional clients. There may have been some theoretical
benefits to these combinations, but the track record of many of these deals was abysmal.
As with fads from prior M&A periods of frenzy, dealmakers, in this case firms that
specialized in doing roll-ups, excelled for a period of time at convincing the market
that there were realistic benefits to be derived from these deals. While some, such as
Coach USA, have survived, many others were successful only in generating fees for the
dealmakers. Many of the consolidated entities went bankrupt, while others lost value
and were sold to other companies. Roll-ups were a fad that became popular while the
market of the 1990s was caught up in a wave of irrational exuberance and was looking
for investment opportunities.
Performance of Fifth Merger Wave Acquirers
When the fifth merger wave began to take hold, corporate managers steadfastly stated
that they would not make the same mistakes that were made in the fourth merger wave.
Many maintained they would not engage in short-term, financially oriented deals, but
would focus only on long-term, strategic deals. In fact, there is evidence that managers
pursued deals that had modest positive effects for shareholders. In a large sample of
12,023 transactions with values greater than $1 million over the period 1980–2001,
Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz found that the deals done at the beginning of the fifth

wave enhanced shareholder value.30 However, between 1998 and 2001, acquiring-firm
shareholders lost a shocking $240 billion! (See Figure 2.4.) These losses dramatically
contrast with the $8 billion that was lost during the entire 1980s (inflation-adjusted
values). From a societal perspective, one might wonder, did the gains of target share-
holders more than offset the losses of acquiring-firm shareholders? The answer is, they
did not even come close. Bidder shareholder losses exceeded those of target shareholders
by $134 billion. However, from the bidder shareholder’s perspective, these “offsetting”
gains are irrelevant. To consider these gains would be like saying, “Let’s pay this large
premium for a given target and, sure, we will lose a large amount of money, but we will
be giving target shareholders a large gain, at our expense, and from society’s perspective,
there may be a net gain on this deal.”
The number of large losers is striking. Moeller and her colleagues found that there
were 87 deals over the period 1998–2001 that lost $1 billion or more for sharehold-
ers. Why were the acquirer’s losses in the fifth wave as large as they were? One expla-
nation is that managers were more restrained at the beginning and the middle of the
fifth wave. They wanted to avoid the mistakes of the prior merger period. However, as
the stock market bubble took hold, the lofty stock valuation went to managers’ heads.
This is evidenced by the dramatically higher P/E ratios that prevailed during this period
(Figure 2.5). Managers likely believed they were responsible for the high values their

shares had risen to. These hubris-filled executives thought that these high valuations
were the product of their managerial expertise rather than the fact that their company,
andmostofthemarket,wasridinganirrationalwaveofovervaluation.Whensuchexec-
utives proposed deals to their board, they now carried the weight of the management’s
team “success” record. It is hard for a board to tell a chief executive officer (CEO) his
or her merger proposals are unsound when they come from the same CEO who claims
responsibility for the highest valuations in the company’s history.
SIXTH WAVE, 2004–2007
As with the four prior merger waves, the fifth wave came to an end when the economy
turned down and entered a brief eight-month recession in 2001. An initially weak
recovery took place after the recession ended. However, the economy was buoyed by the
low interest rates initially established by the Federal Reserve as a response to the 9/11
economic shock that took place at the end of the 2001 recession. Many have criticized
then-chairman Alan Greenspan for holding rates low for so long. These low rates
provided the fuel for a speculative bubble in real estate that became an international
bubble as the international investment world developed an insatiable appetite for
mortgage-backed securities and other debt securitizations. Industries tied to housing,
such as construction, also thrived during the building boom that took place.
The low interest rates also gave a major boost to the private equity business. Lever-
aged acquisitions became less expensive for private equity buyers to do, as the bulk of the

financing costs was relatively low-interest-rate debt. The economy and the market were
also thriving, so equity financing was also readily available. The rising market made it
easier to be successful in the private equity business. Private equity firms found it easy to
raise equity capital and equally easy to borrow money at extremely attractive rates. They
used this equity and debt capital to buy companies or divisions of companies and then
waited for the rising market to push the values of the acquired entities up, at which point
they sold them off at a profit. Since the bulk of the financing was low-interest-rate debt,
they were able to generate high returns for the equity holders. This made private equity
firms thrive, which, in turn, fueled the demand for M&A targets. As Figure 2.6 shows,
the rising demand for targets resulted in higher offers, as reflected by the increase in the
P/Es paid for targets. Thus, we had a relatively short but nonetheless intense M&A wave
that came to a rapid end when the subprime crisis that started in 2007 cut off the access
these firms had to cheap debt and eager equity investors.

ing the four-year period 2004–2007 was comparable to the fifth wave and exceeded
that of the fourth wave.

CHAPTER THREE
Legal Framework
T
HIS CHAPTER FOCUSES MAINLY on the legal regulations governing mergers
and acquisitions (M&As) in the United States. However, the rules for other
countries are also discussed. It will be clear that there are many similarities
in the takeover regulations of various countries, although there are some important
differences.
The legal requirements governing M&As in the United States differ depending on
whether a transaction is a friendly merger or a hostile deal. Within each of these cate-
gories the rules vary depending on whether the transactions are cash- or stock-financed.
The regulatory framework of each of these alternatives is as follows:
◾
Friendly merger—cash financed. The bidder is required to file a proxy statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that describes the deal. Usually, the
bidder has to file a preliminary statement first. If the SEC makes comments, the
preliminary statement may be changed before it is finalized. The finalized proxy
statement is then mailed to shareholders along with a proxy card that they fill out
and return. Following this, the deal has to be approved at a shareholders’ meeting,
whereupon the deal can then be closed.
◾
Friendly merger—stock financed. This process is similar to a cash-financed merger
except that the securities used to purchase target shares have to be registered. The
bidder does this by filing a registration statement. Once this is approved, the com-
bined registration/proxy statement can be sent to shareholders. Obviously, we can
have deals where a combination of stock, cash, and even other securities are used.
◾
Hostile deal—cash tender offer. The bidder initiates the tender offer by disseminating
tender offer materials to target shareholders. Such offers have to be made pursuant

◾
Legal Framework
to the requirements of the Williams Act. This law is discussed at length in this
chapter. However, unlike the friendly transactions just described, the SEC does not
have an opportunity to comment on the materials that are sent to shareholders
prior to their dissemination. The SEC may do so, however, during the minimum
offer period, which will be described later in this chapter.
◾
Hostile deal—stock tender offer. The bidder first needs to submit a registration state-
ment and wait until it is declared effective prior to submitting tender offer materials
to shareholders. The SEC may have comments on the preliminary registration state-
ment that have to be resolved before the statement can be considered effective. Once
this is done, the process proceeds similar to a cash tender offer.
LAWS GOVERNING MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, AND TENDER
OFFERS
Several laws regulate the field of M&As in the United States. These laws set forth the
rules that govern the M&A process. Because target companies use some of these laws as
a defensive tactic when contemplating a takeover, an acquiring firm must take careful
note of legal considerations. The three main groups of laws are securities laws, state
corporation laws, and antitrust laws.
Securities Laws
There are various securities laws that are important to the field of M&As. The more
important parts of these laws are reviewed in this chapter, beginning with the filing of
an 8K, followed by a detailed discussion of the Williams Act.
Filing of an 8K
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that an 8K filing must be made within 15
calendar days after the occurrence of certain specific events.1 Such events include the
acquisition and disposition of a significant amount of assets, including companies. The
filing will include information such as the following:
◾
Description of the assets acquired or disposed of

This threshold can be important. For example, in the 1990s, Tyco did many acquisitions
for which it did not file an 8K due to this filing threshold. However, it did so many acqui-
sitions that the combination was easily in excess of this percentage. Moreover, as the
company grew through its acquisition program, more and larger acquisitions were “go-
ing under the radar” as it became more difficult to readily see the true extent of Tyco’s
acquisition program.
Filing of an S-4
When a public company has to issue new stock to acquire a target, it must register these
shares by filing a disclosure form with the SEC.2 This usually is done through the filing
of an S-4 form, which is slightly less detailed than the S-1 form that a company files
whenitfirstgoespublic.NYSEandNASDAQrules,aswellasmoststatecorporationlaws,
require that when a company issues more than 20% of its outstanding shares to acquire
a target, it must receive the approval of its shareholders. The S-4 provides a substantial
amount of information for shareholders to review to learn about the purposes of the
deal. For example, when Pfizer acquired Wyeth in 2009 in a cash- and stock-financed
transaction, it filed a 351-page S-4.3
In most stock-for-stock transactions, the acquirer and target will file a joint proxy
statement/prospectus within the Form S-4. It will include the proxy statement that
is sent to target shareholders for their approval. If the acquirer’s shareholders have
to approve the deal, they will also receive a proxy statement, which is included in the
filing. All such filings are available on the SEC’s website.4 They must be submitted to the
SEC 10 days prior to being mailed to shareholders. Shareholders must receive written
consent materials at least 20 calendar days prior to a shareholder meeting to approve
the deal. If approved by shareholders, the merger is effective immediately after the filing
of a Certificate of Merger in the state in which the target is incorporated. In a typical
long-form merger, there is no issue of doing a back-end freezeout as all target shares are
converted into a right to receive the merger consideration.
The acquirer is restricted to a period of 48 to 72 hours after the announcement to
make public statements about the transactions. After this time period, a quiet period
ensues until the S-4 becomes effective and is available to the public.
Williams Act
The Williams Act, which was passed in 1968, is one of the most important pieces of secu-
rities legislation in the field of M&A. It had a pronounced impact on merger activity in
the 1970s and 1980s. Before its passage, tender offers were largely unregulated, a situ-
ation that was not a major concern before 1960 because few tender offers were made.
In the 1960s, however, the tender offer became a more popular means of taking con-
trol of corporations and ousting an entrenched management. In tender offers that used
securities as the consideration, the disclosure requirement of the Securities Act of 1933

Legal Framework
provided some limited regulation. In cash offers, however, there was no such regulation.
As a result, the SEC sought to fill this gap in the law, and Senator Harrison Williams, as
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, proposed legislation for that purpose in
1967. The bill won congressional approval in July 1968. The Williams Act provided an
amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a legal cornerstone of securities
regulations. This Act, together with the Securities Act of 1933, was inspired by the gov-
ernment’s concern for greater regulation of securities markets. Both acts have helped
eliminate some of the abuses that many believe contributed to the stock market crash of
October 1929.
Specifically, these laws provide for greater disclosure of information by firms that
issuesecuritiesto the public. Forexample, theSecuritiesAct of 1933requiresthefiling of
a detailed disclosure statement when a company goes public. In addition, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 proscribed certain activities of the securities industry, including
wash sales and the churning of customer accounts. It also provided an enforcement
agency, the SEC, which was established to enforce federal securities laws. In amending
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Williams Act added five new subsections to
the law.
The Williams Act has four major objectives:
1. To regulate tender offers. Before the Williams Act was passed, stockholders of target
companies often were stampeded into tendering their shares quickly to avoid receiv-
ing less advantageous terms.
2. To provide procedures and disclosure requirements for acquisitions. Through greater
disclosure, stockholders could make more enlightened decisions regarding the
value of a takeover offer. Disclosure would enable target shareholders to gain
more complete knowledge of the potential acquiring company. In a stock-for-stock
exchange, the target company stockholders would become stockholders in the
acquiring firm. A proper valuation of the acquiring firm’s shares depends on the
availability of detailed financial data.
3. Toprovideshareholderswithtimetomakeinformeddecisionsregardingtenderoffers.Even
if the necessary information is available to target company stockholders, they still
needtimetoanalyzethedata.TheWilliamsActallowsthemtomakemoreinformed
decisions.
4. To increase confidence in securities markets. By increasing investor confidence, secu-
rities markets can attract more capital. Investors will be less worried about being
placed in a position of incurring losses when making decisions based on limited
information.
Section 13(d) of the Williams Act
Section 13(d) of the Williams Act provides an early warning system for stockholders
and target management, alerting them to the possibility that a threat for control may
soon occur. This section provides for disclosure of a buyer’s stockholdings, whether they
have come from open-market purchases, tender offers, or private purchases, when these

holdings reach 5% of the target firm’s total common stock outstanding. When the law
was first passed, this threshold level was 10%; this percentage was later considered too
high, and the more conservative 5% was adopted. The disclosure of the required infor-
mation, pursuant to the rules of Section 13(d), is necessary even when there is no tender
offer. The buyer who intends to take control of a corporation must disclose the required
information following the attainment of a 5% holding in the target. The buyer makes
this disclosure by filing a Schedule 13D. A filing may be necessary even though no one
individual or firm actually owns 5% of another firm’s stock. If a group of investors act in
concert, under this law their combined stockholdings are considered as one group.
Schedule 13D
Section 13(d) provides for the filing of a Schedule 13D with the SEC and any exchange
on which the issuer’s stock is traded, as well as the issuer.5 The SEC filing is done through
the SEC database—EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval).6 The filing must
be done within 10 calendar days of acquiring 5% of the issuer’s outstanding stock. Cer-
tain parties are exempt from this filing requirement, such as brokerage firms holding
shares in street names or underwriters who happen to acquire shares for a limited period
(up to 40 days).
Schedule 13D requires the disclosure of the following information:7
◾
The name and address of the issuing firm and the type of securities to be acquired.
Forexample,acompanymayhavemorethanoneclassofsecurities.Inthisinstance,
the acquiring firm must indicate the class of securities of which it has acquired at
least 5%.
◾
Detailed information on the background of the individual filing the information,
including any past criminal violations.
◾
The number of shares actually owned.
◾
The purpose of the transaction. At this point, the acquiring firm must indicate
whether it intends to take control of the company or is merely buying the securities
for investment purposes.
◾
The source of the funds used to finance the acquisition of the firm’s stock. The extent
of the reliance on debt, for example, must be disclosed. This is important since if
borrowed funds are used and have to be repaid, this could cause the eventual sale
of the stock in the market, which may have an effect on the stock price. Written
statements from financial institutions documenting the bidder’s ability to procure
the requisite financing may be required to be appended to the schedule.
In addition to the preceding, the bidder must disclose all transactions in the target’s
shares that occurred over the 60-day period prior to the offer.

Legal Framework
Amendments Required under Section 13(d)(2)
Section 13(d)(2) requires the “prompt” filing, with the SEC and the exchanges, by the
issuer when there has been a “material change,” such as acquiring an additional 1%,
in the facts that were set forth in Schedule 13D. As with much of the Williams Act, the
wording is vague regarding what constitutes a material change or even the time period
that is considered prompt. Rule 13d-2 does specify that an increase or decrease of 1% is
considered material. The law is not specific on the time period for filing an amendment
to the original 13D form, although a 10-day period may be acceptable.8 However, for
significant events a filing within one or two days may be expected.9 Such significance
could be found in the market’s sensitivity and reliance on the new information as well as
prior information disclosed in the original filing that now may be significantly different.
The need to have continual disclosure in the case of extended tender offers is a major
drawback of this alternative. The bidder wants to disclose as little as possible so as to
prevent a third party from intervening. In friendly mergers, there are fewer ongoing dis-
closure requirements.
The updating of the 13d filing is an aspect of the U.S. disclosure process that dif-
fers from that of other countries in that U.S. laws require disclosure not just of the new
number of shares but also any new relevant information.
Remedies for Failure to Comply with Section 13(d)
If there is a perceived violation of Section 13(d), either shareholders or the target com-
pany may sue for damages. The courts are more mindful of the target’s shareholders’
rights under Section 13(d) than those of the target corporation itself because this section
of the statute was designed for their benefit as opposed to protecting the interests of the
target corporation. Courts have been more inclined to grant equitable relief, such as in
the form of an injunction, as opposed to compensatory relief in the form of damages.
They are more concerned about making sure the proper disclosure is provided to share-
holders as opposed to standing in the way of an acquisition. In addition to the courts,
the SEC may review the alleged violation of Section 13(d) and could see fit to pursue
an enforcement action. Parties that are found guilty of violating Section 13(d) may face
fines and possible disgorgement.
Derivatives
Generally, the legal principle governing derivatives is that if the security holders do not
have voting or dispositive power of the equity securities, then they do not have to file. If
the acquisition of the derivatives was to avoid having to file a 13D, then a court may not
look kindly on the failure to file.

Schedule 13G
TheSECmakesspecialprovisionsforthoseinvestors,usuallyinstitutionalinvestors,who
acquire 5% or more of a company’s shares but who did not acquire more than 2% of
those shares in the previous 12 months and who have no interest in taking control of
the firm. Such investors are required to file the much less detailed Schedule 13G. Sched-
ule 13G must be filed on February 14 of each year.10 These shareowners are sometimes
called 5% beneficial owners. Parties who own shares or who have “dispositive” power
(power to dispose of the securities), which entitles them to vote the shares, have to file.
If the status of a 13G filer changes, such as they now want to try to influence the
control of the company or even make a bid for it, they must file a 13D and must “sit out”
for a “cooling off” period of 10 days. That is, they cannot take any actions, such as those
that may have been described in the 13D filing, until the passage of 10 days.
Employee Stock Ownership Plans
The SEC may consider the trustee of an employee stock ownership plan to be a benefi-
cial owner of the shares of stock in the plan. An employee stock ownership plan may
have a trustee who is a bank advisor or an investment advisor. In making the determi-
nation of whether the trustee is the beneficial owner, the SEC would consider whether
the trustee has discretionary authority to vote or dispose of the shares. If the trustee has
such discretionary powers, there may be an obligation to file.
Section 14(d)
The Williams Act also provides for disclosure of various information in tender offers,
principally through Section 14(d). Both Sections 13(d) and 14(d) apply only to equity
securities registered with the SEC. These regulations apply to tender offers that, if suc-
cessful, would result in the owner possessing 5% or more of a class of equity securities.
Schedule TO
Under the original wording of the law, disclosure came in the form of a Schedule 14D-1.
A similar schedule, Schedule 13E-4, was filed for tender offers done by the issuer itself.
Since both schedules related to tender offers, either by the issuer or a third party, the SEC
decided in January 2000 to combine the schedules into one filing, which is now called
a Schedule TO.
Schedule TO requires the bidder to disclose various information, such as the specific
shares to be acquired, the identity and background of the bidder, the terms and purpose
of the transaction, and the source of funds to be used. With the schedule, the bidder has
to include the last two years of its financial statements.
10 If the ownership is greater than 10%, however, the filing must be made within 10 days after the end of the
month in which the 10% interest was acquired.

◾
Legal Framework
Commencement of the Offer
The time period of the tender offer may be crucially important in a contested takeover
battle. Therefore, the date on which the offer is initially made is important. For cash
tender offers, the tender offer will begin at 12:01 a.m. on the date that any one of the
following occurs:
◾
Publication of the tender offer
◾
Advertisement of the tender offer (e.g., through an advertisement in the Wall Street
Journal)
◾
Submittal of the tender offer materials to the target
Following an announcement of an offer, the bidder has five business days to dissem-
inate the tender offer materials.
For exchange offers, the bidder has to adhere to the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, and according to Rule 14d-5, the offer cannot commence until
a complete registration statement has been filed with the SEC.
Dissemination of the Offer
At the bidder’s request, the target company must either mail the bidder tender offer
materials to its shareholders or, according to Rule 14d-5, provide the bidder with its
shareholder list so it can send the materials.
Nature of the Offer
It is important to understand that in tender offers, the agreement is between the bidder
and the target shareholders. The bidder may possibly reach some agreement with the
target corporation, but that entity is not necessarily part of the tender offer. The bidder
makes an offer to the target’s shareholders and gives them the means to accept the offer
by giving them a letter of transmittal. When they send it back to the bidder (really, its
agent), then they have a contractual agreement that is subject to the terms of the offer.
Position of the Target Corporation
The target company must respond to the tender offer by filing a Schedule 14D-9 within
10 business days after the commencement date, indicating whether it recommends
acceptance or rejection of the offer.11 If the target contends that it maintains no
position on the offer, it must state its reasons. In addition to filing with the SEC, the
target must send copies of the Schedule 14D-9 to each of the organized exchanges
on which the target’s stock is traded. The target may not make public solicitations or
recommendations to its shareholders until the 14D-9 has been filed with the SEC.
In its response, the target company is required to also include materials such as any
fairness options and other relevant information on its bid that it may have received from
its financial advisors.

Time Periods of the Williams Act
Minimum Offer Period
According to the Williams Act, a tender offer must be kept open for a minimum of 20
business days, during which the acquiring firm must accept all shares that are tendered.
However, it may not actually buy any of these shares until the end of the offer period. The
minimum offer period was added to discourage shareholders from being pressured into
tendering their shares rather than risk losing out on the offer. With a minimum time
period, shareholders can take their time to consider this offer and compare the terms of
the offer with those of other offers. The offering firm may get an extension on the 20-day
offer period, if, for example, it believes there is a better chance of getting the shares it
needs.Theacquiringfirmmustpurchasethesharestendered(atleastonaproratabasis)
at the offer price unless the firm does not receive the total number of shares it requested
in the terms of the tender offer. The acquirer may, however, still choose to purchase the
tendered shares.
The tender offer may be worded to contain other escape clauses. For example, when
antitrust considerations are an issue, the offer may be contingent on attaining the reg-
ulatory agencies’ approval. Therefore, the offer might be so worded as to state that the
bidder is not bound to buy if the Justice Department or the FTC objects to the merger.
Unlike some other countries, in the United States, while there is a minimum offer
period, there is no maximum offer period.
Exchange Offers
When the offer is a stock-for-stock, or a cash and stock combination for stock trans-
action, this is referred to as an exchange offer. The rules allow an exchange offer to
commence after a registration statement for the shares being offered has been filed with
the SEC. This is an “early” commencement, as the offered is not yet “effective.” In order
to be able to do that, the bidder does the filing, disseminates a prospectus to all the secu-
rity holders, and files the Schedule TO. However, no shares may be actually purchased
until 20 business days after commencement.
Withdrawal Rights
Shareholders may withdraw their shares any time during the entire period the offer
remains open. The goal of this rule is to allow shareholders sufficient time to evaluate
the offer—or offers, in the case of multiple bids. However, under the new 14d-11 Rule
the bidder may provide an optional three days after the expiration of the 20-day period
to accept additional shares tendered, assuming the bidder promptly pays for the shares
already tendered and gives the shareholders who tender during this three-day period the
same consideration and prompt payment.
Partial and Two-Tiered Tender Offers
A partial tender offer is one in which there is a bid for less than 100%, such as a bid for
51%, which usually affords the acquirer control of the target. Two-tiered tender offers

80
◾
Legal Framework
are bids that provide one type of compensation for a first tier, such as the first 51%, and
other compensation for the remaining shares. Courts have generally found these types
of bids coercive and opposing the spirit of the Williams Act, as shareholders in the back
end of the offer may find that their shares trade for less than before the bid. They may
also be in constant fear that their stock positions will be frozen out. The Best Price Rule,
which we discuss shortly, combined with similar state laws, as well as similar corporate
charter amendments, has reduced the effectiveness of such coercive offers.
While these types of bids are not illegal in the United States, courts have found that
targetsmaybefreertotakeaggressivedefensivemeasureswhenfacedwithsuchoffers.12
This is different from the position of courts in the United Kingdom, which prevents a
majority shareholder from freezing out minority shareholders.
Pro Rata Acceptance
In many instances, tender offers are oversubscribed. For example, an offer to purchase
51% of a target company’s stock may receive 80% of the total shares outstanding.
Approximately five-eighths of each share submitted would be accepted if all 80% of
the shares were tendered during the first 10 days of an offer to purchase 51% of the
outstanding stock. If an additional 10% were submitted after the tenth calendar day of
the offer, these shares would not be accepted unless the acquiring company decided to
accept more shares than were stipulated in the 51% offer.
Deﬁnition of a Tender Offer
The Williams Act is purposefully vague and does not offer a clear definition of a tender
offer. Not surprisingly, this vagueness gave rise to litigation as tender offer participants
chose to adopt the definition of a tender offer that was most favorable to them. In Ken-
necott Copper Corporation v. Curtiss-Wright Corporation, the court found that open market
purchases without a deadline and for which no premium was offered did not constitute
a tender offer.13 However, in Wellman v. Dickinson the U.S. District Court for the Second
Circuit set forth the Eight Factor Test.14
These factors are listed here and are revisited in Chapter 6:
1. There is active and widespread solicitation of public shareholders for shares of an
issuer.
2. Solicitation is made for a substantial percentage of an issuer’s stock.
3. Offer to purchase is made at a premium over the prevailing market price.
4. Terms of the offer are firm rather than negotiated.
5. Offer is contingent on the tender of a fixed number of shares and possibly specifying
a maximum number of shares.
6. Offer is open for only a limited time period.

7. Offeree is subject to pressure to sell stock.
8. There are public announcements of a purchasing program that precede or are coin-
cident with a rapid accumulation of shares.15
A transaction need not satisfy all eight factors in order to be considered a tender
offer.
In Hanson Trust PLC v. SCM Corp., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Cir-
cuit recognized that the Wellman factors are relevant to determining whether certain
actions by a bidder constitute a tender offer.16 However, the court stopped short of say-
ing that these factors are a “litmus test.” Rather, this court applied the totality of the
circumstances test when it focused on whether offerees would be put at an informational
disadvantage if official tender offer procedures were not followed. Other courts have put
forward more basic tests. In a district court opinion in S-G Securities, Inc. v. Fuqua Invest-
ment Co., the court concluded that a tender offer exists if the following occurs:17

SUN OIL VERSUS BECTON DICKINSON
T
he Becton Dickinson Corporation is a medical products company that is located
in Bergen County, New Jersey. The company was run for 25 years by Fairleigh
S. Dickinson Jr. until 1974. He was the son of the founder of the company, Fairleigh
Dickinson Sr., who also founded Fairleigh Dickinson University. Fairleigh Dickin-
son Jr. had turned over the day-to-day control to a management team headed by
Wesley Howe and Marvin Ashe. As time passed, disagreements occurred between
Fairleigh Dickinson Jr. and Howe and Ashe. For example, they disagreed on certain
personnel decisions and on other strategic decisions, such as the acquisition of
National Medical Care—a Boston-based medical care company. Fairleigh Dickinson
Jr. opposed this particular acquisition because the equity offered for the purchase
would dilute his shareholdings and his ownership percentage. The pattern of dis-
agreements came to a head in a board of directors meeting in which Ashe and
Howe called for the removal of Fairleigh Dickinson Jr. as chairman of the board of
directors.
While the internecine conﬂicts were ongoing at Becton Dickinson, Sun Oil
Inc., a Philadelphia-based corporation, was pursuing an expansion program that
would help it diversify outside the petroleum industry. Sun Oil was working with its
investment banker, Salomon Brothers, to ﬁnd suitable non-oil acquisition candidates.

◾
Legal Framework
(continued )
Given its position in its industry, Sun Oil found Becton Dickinson an attractive
takeover target. Salomon Brothers, the investment banker for both Sun Oil and
Fairleigh Dickinson Jr., was more easily able to reach an understanding between
the two parties, which provided for Fairleigh Dickinson Jr. to sell his 5% holdings in
Becton Dickinson to Sun Oil at the appropriate time.
Sun Oil obtained commitments from 33 ﬁnancial institutions to buy 20% of
the outstanding shares of Becton Dickinson. On one day, couriers were sent to
these institutions to purchase these shares. Following the stock purchase, Sun Oil
informed the New York Stock Exchange and Becton Dickinson of its actions. It did
not ﬁle a 14D-1 but did ﬁle a 13D.
In a lawsuit that followed, the court ruled that Sun Oil had violated the Williams
Act by not ﬁling a 13D when it had reached its understanding with Fairleigh Dick-
inson Jr. to purchase his 5%.
Materials That Shareholders Receive
Shareholders receive an Offer to Purchase and a Letter of Transmittal. The Offer to Pur-
chase sets forth the terms of the offer. Chief among these terms are the number of shares
to be purchased, the offer price, and the length of time the offer will remain open. The
Offer to Purchase may be many pages in length (e.g., 30 pages) and may contain much
additional information for shareholders to consider, such as withdrawal rights, a discus-
sion of tax considerations, and more details on the terms of the offer.
Method of Tendering Shares
Stockholders tender their shares through an intermediary, such as a commercial bank
or trust company, which is referred to as the paying agent. As stockholders seek to par-
ticipate in the tender offer, they submit their shares to the paying agent in exchange for
cash or securities, in accordance with the terms of the offer. Attached to their shares
must be a letter of transmittal.
The agent accumulates the shares but does not pay the stockholders until the offer
expires. In the event that the offer is extended, the paying agent holds the shares until
the new offer expires, unless instructed otherwise by the individual stockholders. The
bidder may extend an undersubscribed tender. In fact, it is not unusual for an offer to
be extended several times as the bidder tries to get enough shares to ensure control. If
the bidder decides to extend the offer, it must announce the extension no later than 9:00
a.m.onthebusinessdayfollowingthedayonwhichtheofferwastohaveexpired.Atthat
time, the bidder must disclose the number of shares that have already been purchased.
As noted, shareholders have the right to withdraw their shares at any time during the
offer period. The fact that they originally tendered them in response to the offer does not
limit their ability to change their mind or tender these same shares to a competing offer
after they withdraw them.

Laws Governing Mergers, Acquisitions, and Tender Offers

83
Changes in the Tender Offer
The Williams Act allows a modification in the offer period if there is a material change
in the terms of the offer. The length of the extension in the offer period depends on
the significance of the change, which generally is considered a new offer. A new offer
ensures the stockholders have a 20-day period to consider the offer. A higher price
might be considered such a significant change. A less significant change results in an
amendedoffer,whichprovidesfora10-day(alsobusinessdays)minimumofferperiod.An
increase in the number of shares to be purchased might be considered an amended offer.
Best Price Rule and Other Related Rules
Under Section 14(d)(7), if the bidder increases the consideration offered, the bidder
must pay this increased consideration to all those who have already tendered their
shares at the lower price. The goal of this section is to ensure that all tender shareholders
are treated equally, regardless of the date within the offer period that they tender their
shares. Under SEC Rule 14d-10, a bidder may offer more than one type of considera-
tion. In such cases, however, selling stockholders have the right to select the type of
consideration they want. More recently this rule was revised to allow management
shareholders to receive extra compensation as long as that extra compensation was
for services they would provide. A “safe harbor” compensation arrangement is also
available to directors.
Bidder Purchases Outside of Tender Offer
The bidder may not purchase shares outside the tender offer on terms that are different
from those of the tender offer. There may be exceptions to this rule if the SEC agrees
to exempt the transactions based on its belief that the purchases are not manipulative,
fraudulent, or deceptive. Such purchases, however, are permitted in the event that the
tender offer concludes or is withdrawn.
Payment Following Completion of the Offer
The law provides that the tendered shares must be either paid for promptly after the offer
is terminated or returned to the shareholders. This prompt payment may be frustrated
by other regulatory requirements, such as the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The bidder may
postpone payment if other regulatory approvals must still be obtained after the Williams
Act offer period expires.
Mini-Tender Offers
Mini-tender offers are bids for less than 5% of a company’s stock. Such offers are
much less regulated as bidders, and are not required to comply with the disclosure
requirements for larger tender offers. Investors who accept such offers need to know
that they are not entitled to pro rata acceptance and do not have withdrawal rights.
These offers may not contain a premium and may even be below the market price.
Therefore, investors need to be wary of them.

84
◾
Legal Framework
Taking Control after a Successful Tender Offer
It is common that after a successful tender offer the target and the bidder agree that
the bidder may elect a majority of the board of directors. This allows the bidder to take
control of the board of directors without calling a meeting of the shareholders and solic-
iting their voting approval. After a successful tender offer for 50% or more of the target’s
shares, the so-called minimum condition, the outcome of such a vote is moot.
The process of using a tender offer to gain control of a target can be more difficult
when there are antitakeover defenses that limit the ability of a bidder to appoint mem-
bers to the board. If this is not the case, the board change may go smoothly. If the target
agrees to the change in control of the board, it must communicate to the SEC and its
shareholders information about the new directors similarly to how it would normally
be disclosed if they were nominees in an election of directors.
Delisting the Target
Following a takeover and merger of a target into the bidder, a bidder/target may then file
to have the target’s shares delisted from the exchanges on which it was traded. A Form
25 then needs to be filed with and approved by the SEC.
Competing Tender Offers
An initial tender offer often attracts rival tender offers in takeover battles. Because the
law was designed to give stockholders time to carefully consider all relevant alternatives,
an extension of the offer period is possible when there is a competing offer. The Williams
Act states that, in the event of a new tender offer, stockholders in the target company
must have at least 10 business days to consider the new offer. In effect, this 10-day con-
sideration period can extend the original offer period. Consider, for example, that we are
16 days into the first offer when a new bidder makes a tender offer for the target firm;
then target shareholders have at least 10 days to decide on the original offer. As a result,
the original offer period is extended. If, however, the new offer occurred on the fourth
day of the first offer period, there would not be an extension of the original offer period.
Applicability of U.S. Tender Offer Rules to Takeovers of Non-U.S.
Companies
The U.S. tender offer rules apply to U.S. companies when they make bids for the shares of
foreign companies if the target’s shares are registered in the United States. Exemptions
may be had in cases where the foreign issuer’s U.S. shareholders make up less than 10%
of the total shares outstanding.
Tender Offers for Debt Securities
Technically, tender offers for straight debt securities (debt that is not convertible) have to
conform to the antifraud provisions of securities laws that govern tender offers, includ-
ing the minimum 20-day offer period and the requirement that offer periods be extended

when the offer price changes. However, the SEC has issued “no-action” letters in which it
has indicated that it will not enforce these laws in the case of straight debt tender offers.

of enforcing tender offer rules.
OTHER U.S. TAKEOVER RULES
There are specific takeover rules that may be relevant to certain takeovers. For example,
in the utility sector, there is the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), passed
in 1935, which imposed geographical limitations on utility mergers while also placing
restrictions on utilities’ investments in nonenergy companies. This law was overseen by
the SEC. However, the Energy Policy Act liberalized these outmoded rules. The Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission was formed and took a role in reviewing utility deals.
Regulation to Protect National Interests
Takeovers that are determined to be threats to U.S. national security can be halted by
the president. Such deals are reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States (CFIUS), a 12-member interagency panel that includes the secretaries of
treasury, state, defense, and commerce, which makes a recommendation to the pres-
ident. This panel does not review all deals, and most dealmakers and their advisors,
when they believe there may be a potential security issue, contact the committee so as
not to have a problem after the fact. Potential opposition to deals related to CFIUS was
a key factor in China’s CNOOC Ltd. dropping its $18.5 billion all-cash offer for Unocal
in August 2005 and for the Dubai-owned Ports World’s amendment of its 2006 $6.8
billion offer for Britain’s Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co., which held con-
tracts to manage six U.S. ports.
The CIFUS review process begins after both parties to the transaction submit a
notice to the committee chairperson who is at the U.S. Treasury (CIFUS@treasury.gov).
After the chair determines the notice is complete and contains the information CIFUS
requires, a 30-day review period begins the next day. The members of the committee
then can ask the parties to provide additional specific information and the parties have
three business days to provide a response (or more days if CIFUS allows). The parties
may get an answer within the 30 day period or CIFUS can inform them that it may take
an additional 45 days to review the deal. If CIFUS finds the deal objectionable, it still
may allow it to go forward if the parties make changes it may request. In 2017 CIFUS
slowed and stalled a number of proposed acquisitions by Chinese buyers.
Regulation of Proxy Solicitation
State corporation laws require annual shareholder meetings. In order to achieve a quo-
rum, the company solicits proxies from shareholders. Bidders attempting to take over
a company may also solicit proxies from shareholders. Section 14(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act regulates these solicitations. As part of these regulations, a solicitor must

86
◾
Legal Framework
file a proxy statement and a Schedule 14A, which must also be given to security holders.
According to Rule 14a-6, proxy materials must be filed with the SEC 10 days before they
are used. An exception exists for more noncontroversial events, such as annual meet-
ings. However, in no case must the materials be used prior to being submitted. In light
of the substantial mailing costs that security holders who have their own proposals may
incur, the law requires the issuer to provide a supporting statement (up to 500 words),
which is included with management proxy proposals. Only a very small percentage of
such security holder solicitations are successful.
TAKEOVERS AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITIES LAWS
In this section, we will highlight some of the different takeover laws that exist in coun-
tries other than the United States. A comprehensive discussion of these various laws is
beyond the scope of this book. However, some of them are discussed to give the reader a
flavor of their variety and also the extent to which many have provisions similar to U.S.
takeover rules.
Global financial regulation has evolved substantially over the past quarter of a
century. As many companies are becoming increasingly globalized, large variation
in securities laws has become an impediment to growth. Fortunately, we have seen a
trend toward common regulations across many nations. This is true with many forms
of securities regulations, and M&As are no exception. There are still differences across
nations, but more and more those differences have declined.
Europe
Great Britain
British takeover regulation used to be a form of self-regulation by the corporate sec-
tor and the securities industry. One of the main principles of the regulations, called the
City Code of Takeovers and Mergers, is that in M&As all shareholders be treated equally
and fairly.
The City Code attempts to prevent target firms from adopting antitakeover measures
without prior shareholder approval. Some of the more important provisions of the Code
are as follows:
◾
Investors acquiring 30% or more of a company’s shares, having acquired de facto
control, must bid for the remaining shares at the highest price paid for the shares
already acquired. This is sometimes referred to as the mandatory bid rule, or the
“put up or shut up rule.”
◾
A bidder may only release information on the bid in a manner consistent with the
Code.
◾
If rumors of a bid occur, then the potential bidder must make a clarifying
announcement.

Takeovers and International Securities Laws
◾
87
The target’s shareholders must approve antitakeover measures, such as
supermajority provisions or the issuance of options to be given to friendly parties.
The case law in the United Kingdom favors shareholders’ rights and is generally
supportive of takeover bids. Antitakeover defenses that impede shareholder rights and
that lack clear corporate purposes other than management entrenchment are frowned
upon.18 This includes defensive tools such as poison pills, which are quite popular
in the United States. Staggered boards are also ineffective in the United Kingdom as
shareholders have the right to remove directors at any time. This is why hostile bids
may be more likely to succeed in the United Kingdom than in the United States.19
European Union
The European Takeover Directive regulates takeovers in Europe. Through negotiations
among members of the European Union, the Code has been diluted by countries that
want to give their indigenous companies a greater ability to oppose hostile takeovers
from bidders from other countries—even if they are from EU member states. The main
opposition to a common set of rules came from Germany and Sweden.
In order to protect minority shareholders the directive contains a requirement to
make a mandatory offer after a bidder purchases a certain number of shares. This bid
must be made at an equitable price and must be submitted to shareholders with cer-
tain disclosures relating to the offer and bidder. Target shareholders must have no less
than two weeks to evaluate the bid. The directive contains provisions to limit the use of
poison pills and shares with multiple voting rights to oppose hostile bids. However, mem-
ber states may choose to opt out of the provisions that they find not in their interests
and substitute their own national rules. Their individual national rules are still relevant
depending on the particular circumstances.
France
In France, takeover activity is more common than in most other nations in continental
Europe. In France, bids are regulated by the Financial Markets Authority (Autorite des
marches financiers or “AMF”), which is a 16-member group with each member elected for
five-year terms. Bidders, acting through financial representatives such as banks, must
submit disclosures to this entity. Filings must be made within five trading days of cross-
ing various shareholding thresholds, starting with 5% and moving up to two-thirds of
outstanding shares.20 Bidders acquiring additional shares must disclose their holdings
on a daily basis. Offers for French companies are required to remain open for 25 trading

Legal Framework
but if the bidder acquires control in the target, a compulsory bid is required. France also
has an antitakeover law, which provides protection to potential targets.
In 2014, French takeover rules were amended to establish a minimum bid threshold
of 50%. This was done to prevent creeping bids. If a bid fails to attain the 50% minimum,
it lapses.
French rules favor long-term shareholders. Shareholders holding their shares for
two years or more automatically acquire double voting rights although there is a provi-
sion for opting out.
Germany
In general, Germany tends to be more supportive of management and more accepting
of antitakeover defenses. This position is partly due to the shock of the takeover of Man-
nesmann by Vodafone. In Germany, as well as in the Netherlands, there is a system of
worker codetermination, where it is common for a representative of management to sit
on the board of directors and seek to exercise a worker claim to corporate profits. Also on
the board may be representatives of banks who are major lenders to the company and
who may look out for the interests of creditors.
Takeovers
are
regulated
by
several
laws,
including
the
Takeover
Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz, WpÜG). They are supervised by the
Federal Office of Supervision of Financial Services (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleis-
tungsaufsicht or BaFin), which is like the SEC in the United States and the FSA in Great
Britain.
In Germany, mandatory offers for the complete company are required when a bid-
der acquires a threshold number of shares. Offers must be kept open for 28 days but no
more than 60 days. Targets must respond within two weeks of receiving the offer. Offers
must be publicized in approved national newspapers. Hostile bids are not common in
Germany due to the large cross holdings that have been assembled over many years,
including major holdings by banks that tend to be supportive of management.
Ireland
Takeovers in Ireland are regulated by the Takeover Panel Act of 1997, which estab-
lished the Takeover Panel that oversees takeovers.21 Acquisitions of shares of 5% or
more require a disclosure. Additional disclosure is required for purchase of 1% or more of
a target’s shares. In Ireland, there is a 21-day minimum offer period. In hostile bids, the
target must respond within 14 days.
The Irish takeover rules emphasize that all shareholders be given equal treatment.
This includes protections for minority shareholders in the event that a “person” acquires
a controlling position. Bidders must be able to demonstrate the financial wherewithal to
complete an offer. There are also restrictions in place on the ability of a potential bidder
to acquire a shareholding of between 15% and 30% of a target’s voting rights.

Takeovers and International Securities Laws
◾
89
The Netherlands
In the Netherlands, takeovers must be made pursuant to the Securities Act, which is
enforced by the Authority for Financial Markets. Acquisitions of shareholdings at vari-
ous thresholds, starting at 5%, require disclosure. Bids must be kept open for at least 20
days, but, in effect, rules make this period 23 days.22 For hostile bids, the target’s board
must disclose its position four days prior to a shareholder meeting that may be called to
address the bid.
In 2012, the Netherlands implemented a “put up or shut up” rule. This rule allows
the Netherlands authority for financial markets (the AMF) to be able to require a poten-
tial bidder, one that has made public statements that could be construed as indicative
of a takeover planning, to make a definitive statement to the public market as to its
intentions. If the presumed bidder denies interest in a takeover, that potential bidder is
prohibited from making a takeover bid for six months.
The Netherlands has a mandatory bid requirement. This requirement is triggered
by a bidder controlling 30% of the voting rights of a target company.
The Netherlands’ takeover rules came under the spotlight in 2017, when the
American paint maker PPG walked away from a proposed takeover of Dutch paint
company Akzo Nobel. PPG had reached a deadline to file formal documents with
the AMF regarding a specific bid it would make for Akzo. However, Akzo’s board and
management opposed the takeover even though many of its shareholders favored it.
Italy
Italian takeover rules divide tender offers into voluntary and mandatory offers. A vol-
untary bid can be either hostile or friendly. Mandatory bids are required when the bidder
acquires enough shares to gain control of a certain percentage of the target’s board as
defined by the Draghi Law.
The time periods for these two types of tender offers differ. Mandatory bids have an
offer period of between 15 and 25 trading days compared to voluntary bids, which have
an offer period of between 15 and 40 trading days. The bidder determines the prices
in voluntary tender offers, whereas in mandatory bids the price is determined by a best
price rule. This rule requires that the price must be at least equal to the highest price paid
by the offeror for purchases of the any of target’s shares within the 12 months leading
up to the bid.
Spain
In Spain, as in France, hostile bids are common. Bidders acquiring 5% or more of a
target’s stock must notify the National Securities Market Commission. This body then
suspends the trading of the target’s stock. The bidder must make a formal announce-
ment of the bid, in at least two national newspapers and the commission’s Official

tical Law, 2005-2006).

Gazette, within five days of making the offer.23 Offers may be kept open for as long as
four months.
There is a mandatory bid rule in Spain that basically requires that if a party acquires
control, it must make a bid for the shares of the remaining shareholders. This bid must
be at the highest price paid by the bidder for shares in the target acquired within the
prior 12 months. However, in 2014, Spanish takeover rules were modified to allow for
certain exceptions. These include voluntary bids where more than 50% of the target’s
shares were acquired. Other exceptions include companies under financial duress.
Russia
In mid-2006, Russia adopted a broad takeover reform law. It provides for both a minor-
ity put option and minority squeeze-out. The law provides for mandatory tender offers
within 35 days after crossing an odd mix of share thresholds of 30%, 50%, and 70%.
It also requires bidders to attain antimonopoly approval before completing 100% stock
acquisitions. Mandatory tender offers have minimum price requirements, with share-
holders having an option to choose cash in the case of securities offers. The minimum
price cannot be lower than the stock’s price in the prior six-month trading period. Offers
documents must be filed with the Russian Federal Service for the Financial Markets.
When a bidder makes a “voluntary or mandatory offer” it must make certain dis-
closures, such as the number of shares actually owned, the number it is making a bid
for, and the price.24
Competing offers must be submitted no less than 25 days prior to the expiration of
the original bidder’s offer. Such a competing offer may not feature a price lower than the
original bidder’s offer.
Canada
Takeover rules in Canada were revised in February 2008 to be more consistent with
those of the United States. Filing requirements are similar to the Schedule TO that is filed
in the United States. However, there are some important differences in Canada. One such
difference is the mandatory offer requirement when bidders acquire 20% or more of a
target’s shares. Like the United States and many other nations, Canada has regulations
that allow the government to intervene to stop transactions larger than $250 million if
the government believes that national security is threatened by the deal.
Asia
As noted in Chapters 1 and 2, the M&A business is rapidly evolving in many Asian mar-
kets. As these markets continue to restructure, their laws evolve to accommodate the
volume of deals.
23 Francisco Pena and Fernando de las Cuevas, “Spain,” in Mergers and Acquisitions: 2005/06 (London: Prac-
tical Law, 2005–2006).
24 What is “voluntary” or “mandatory” is somewhat subjective under the Russian system of justice.

Takeovers and International Securities Laws

Japan
For many years there was little takeover activity in Japan, and thus less focus on takeover
regulation. For example, over the two-decade period between 1971 and 1990, there
were only four tender offers.25 However, as the Japanese economy faltered when its stock
and real estate bubbles burst and the nation entered a decade-long recession, the slow
process of restructuring the Japanese corporate world began. As part of that process,
takeovers became somewhat more common.
Tender offer regulations were first introduced in Japan in 1971. They were signifi-
cantly revised in 1990 and again in 2006. Japanese takeover regulations are contained
in the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (formerly the Securities and Exchange
Law). Pursuant to this law, tender offers must be kept open for 20 calendar days but not
more than 60. Mandatory tender offers are required in cases where tender offers com-
mence after a public notice of the offer and an announcement that must be carried in
two or more major newspapers. In addition, a Registration Statement has to be filed with
the Kanto Local Finance Bureau on the announcement day. This Registration Statement
contains information somewhat similar to a U.S. Schedule TO.
As in the United States, the target is required to file a response called the Opinion
Report in 10 business days with the local Finance Bureau. In this response, the target
can raise questions about the offer. The bidder, in turn, must then respond by filing a
Report in Response to Questions within five business days. Bidders can increase their bid
but not decrease it, and they are limited in their ability to withdraw an offer. They are
also prevented from purchasing shares outside the tender offer. Shareholders, however,
may withdraw their shares at any time during the offer period.
Japanese securities rules also require that defenses should be disclosed when
installed and that they should facilitate the enhancement of shareholder value. The
defenses that are allowed include required share exchanges in which a bidder’s acquired
voting shares can be exchanged for nonvoting stock. Japanese rules also state that the
level of defense should be related to the magnitude of the threat to shareholder value,
which is somewhat akin to a U.S. Unocal Standard.
In enforcing takeover laws, Japanese courts have reached decisions somewhat sim-
ilar to what one would expect to see in Delaware courts. These decisions allow for the
use of antitakeover defenses but with an eye toward enhancing shareholder value and
not in a way that would hurt shareholders and merely entrench management.
On the competition front, Japan’s Anti-Monopoly Law tries to prevent anticompet-
itive M&As. It contains provisions somewhat similar to the U.S. antitrust rules.
South Korea
The South Korean Commercial Code contains a broad variety of laws governing South
Korean companies, including those that relate to the incorporation of businesses but
also takeover regulations and other control share transactions. Acquisitions by foreign

buyers of South Korean companies traded on the South Korean Exchange are also
governed by the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act. In addition,
antitrust issues are governed by the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act, which is
enforced by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission.
Under South Korea’s Securities Exchange Law, when a shareholder acquires a stock
position of 5%, that shareholder is required to file a Public Ownership Report with this
country’s Financial Supervisory Commission within five business days of reaching that
percentageholding.Anadditionalreportisrequiredforfurthersharepurchasesof1%or

South Korea’s Securities Exchange Law requires that a tender offer statement be
filed when such a bid is initiated. Target companies are not required to do a formal filing
in response to a bid, but they can make such a statement if they choose to. Tender offer
rules apply equally to offers from outside parties as well as self-tenders. Violators of these
laws are subject to both administrative and criminal penalties.
There are restrictions on the ability of foreign investors to acquire companies in
certain key industries, but these have been significantly relaxed in recent years. Many
Korean companies are protected by rules that allow for large golden parachutes, as well
as a requirement that two-thirds shareholder approval be received before changes in the
board of directors can take place.
China
With the advent of communism in the 1950s in China, shareholding disappeared. China
began the slow process of returning to some form of a free market economy in the 1980s.
The Shanghai and Shenzhen Exchanges were founded in 1990, and all trading was
expected to occur on these exchanges. Interim trading rules were established in 1993.
This was followed by the Securities Law of China, which went into effect in July 1999.
This law provided for acquisitions of public companies through agreement between the
parties as well as through bids.
The Securities Law requires that owners of 5% or more of a public company’s
shares disclose this holding to the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CRSC),
the exchange on which the shares are traded, and to the issuing company within three
days of acquiring this position. Once a 30% holding is achieved, the holder of the shares
is prohibited from purchasing more shares unless it does a tender offer for the entire
company. This is referred to as the mandatory bid rule. These rules were amended in
the Takeover Code released in 2006, which allows for a partial tender offer that would
be available to all shareholders. The acquiring shareholder, however, may request a
waiver of the mandatory bid requirement from the CRSC.
The 2006 rules also governed the price that would be paid by bidders using a form
of a fair price provision. Like other international jurisdictions, the consideration can be

cash or securities, but if the securities are deemed illiquid, then the buyer must provide
a cash alternative.
Acquisitions by Foreigners of Chinese Companies In December 2005, new
rules, called Administrative Measures for Strategic Investment by Foreign Investors
in Listed Companies, were implemented that potentially reversed a long-term policy
limiting the ability of foreign investors to acquire controlling positions in Chinese
companies. Prior to this rule, foreign investors were limited in their ability to acquire
tradable Class A shares and were often restricted to nontradable Class B shares, which
are less appealing. The new rules opened up the Chinese market for foreign investors
to purchase tradable shares. This, however, does not mean that the market is totally
open and foreign investors have an unrestricted ability to acquire control over Chinese
corporations. In fact, after opening the door for foreign investors to purchase tradable
Class A shares, China adopted additional rules that require foreign buyers of Chinese
assets to get Ministry of Commerce (MofCom) clearance before completing deals involv-
ing key industries and well-known Chinese brands. If U.S. readers find such restrictions
inconsistent with their desire for open and free markets, they need to remember back
to 2005 and the opposition to Chinese petroleum company CNOOC’s bid for Unocal on
“national security” grounds and realize that even countries that hold themselves out
to be advocates of free markets may deviate from such a stance for political reasons.
In 2008, China finally passed its new antimonopoly law that had been 10 years in
the making. The law is based on aspects of U.S. and European competition laws, but it
basically has provisions that seek to prevent dominance of markets by certain compa-
nies. It also has unique aspects, such as protecting the public interest and a “socialist
market economy.” The law also features protections for state-owned businesses and the
monopoly positions they may have.
China’s entry as a “player” in the global M&A antitrust approval process has made
the closing of global deals slower and more complicated. In addition, China’s MofCom’s
Anti-Monopoly Bureau has not been staffed sufficiently to handle a large volume of
deals. Also, in reviewing deals, like EU regulators, Chinese regulators seek to protect the
interests of Chinese companies when reviewing international deals.
Acquisitions of Foreign Companies by Chinese Acquirers For some time,
Chinese regulators seemed flexible and somewhat accommodating to Chinese bidders
seeking to expand internationally and acquire foreign companies. In fact, 2016 was a
record year for outbound Chinese M&A. However, this stance changed somewhat in late
2016 and 2017 (see Figures 3.1a and 3.1b). At that time, the government battled with
a slower economic growth and the desire of Chinese nationals to take currency out of
the country in response to this weaker growth. These currency movements caused the
renminbi to weaken, which forced the Chinese central bank to intervene in the currency
market to maintain the value of the renminbi. This was a real dilemma, as the govern-
ment wants to have a stable currency, especially as the IMF has added the renminbi as
a reserve currency, but it also wants to try to stimulate the economy through higher
exports—something a weaker currency would help.

When Chinese firms want to acquire foreign targets, they must submit appli-
cations to the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform
Commission—the country’s main economic planning entity. If these two agencies
decide the deal could go forward, it still has to be approved by State Administration
of Foreign Exchange, which considers the impact the deal, and possibly others like it,
may have on the ability of China to control the value of the renminbi. In 2017, these
regulators began to limit the ability of Chinese companies to freely acquire non-Chinese
targets. In reaching their decisions, they focused on whether the outbound M&A was
really bringing benefits to China. These limitations were formalized in 2017 when the
State Council, China’s cabinet, issued guidelines which highlighted specific industries,
such as real estate, hotels, cinemas, entertainment, and sports teams, as not likely to
receive government approval of acquisitions. The Chinese government has been con-
cerned that some Chinese companies have been using readily available debt financing
to expand globally into industries that it did not consider consistent with its goals, such
as its Asian infrastructure initiative, “One Belt—One Road.” Interestingly, as trade
tensions rose between the United States and China, as well as other nations, the CIFUS
committee also began to raise barriers within the United States to Chinese acquisitions.
Taiwan
Taiwan’s main M&A law is the Business Mergers and Acquisitions Act, which was
passed in 2002 and updated in 2004. Taiwan’s takeover rules are set forth in the Tender
Offer Rules for Public Issuance Companies. Tender offer rules have been in effect since
1995, but they have had little impact due to the paucity of such offers, which is, in
part, due to the fact that many companies are controlled by large family shareholding
positions. Revisions of these rules took effect in 2005. These rules require that bidders
make a public announcement prior to initiating an offer. They also provide for greater
disclosure in such tender offers. Under prior rules, target shareholders could withdraw

shares for the entire offer period, but those withdrawal rights are now limited if the
terms of the offer have been met during the offer period.
As with many countries in Asia, Taiwan has limitations on acquisitions by foreign
investors, but it, too, has followed the trend to relax these restrictions. The competitive
impact of M&As is evaluated by Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission.
India
Prior to the 1990s, takeovers in India were regulated by the Companies Act. However,
this law proved insufficient to deal with the first Indian merger wave that took place in
the 1980s. Up to that point, any bidders who acquired 25% or more of a company’s
shares were required to make a public offer to the shareholders of the company. Bidders
circumvented this law by acquiring just under 25% but using the shareholding to con-
trol the target. The Indian financial and legal establishment recognized the insufficiency
of their M&A rules, and a process of upgrading the regulations began to take place.
In 1997, India implemented the Takeover Code of 1997, which was amended
with the Takeover Code of 2002. These rules were replaced by the 2011 Takeover
Regulations. With respect to tender offers, the rules require a mandatory tender offer if
an entity acquires 26% of a target’s shares. These newer rules also made clear that any
entity acquiring control over a target is obligated to make mandatory tender offers.
Control can be established in various ways, including the ability to appoint directors so
as to control the board of directors.
If there is a competing offer, it has to be made with 15 business days of the ini-
tial offer. After that, the offers have to be treated equally and the target cannot favor
one offer over the other. The competing offer can only be made conditional on a mini-
mum acceptance level if the initial bid was also conditional.
Offers can be withdrawn if they do not receive required statutory approvals or if
allowable conditions were not met. In India, there is a best price rule, which is defined in
various ways such as the negotiated price or the highest average price paid by the bidder
during the 52-week period prior to the bid.
Australia
The Uniform Companies Code that was passed in 1961 provided regulations for
takeovers. Various changes in the law were made since then and they are set forth
in the Corporations Act of 2001. The key takeover regulators in Australia are the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Takeover Panel.
The ASIC provides supervision of the Corporations Act, while the Takeover Panel is the
forum for handling takeover disputes. The Panel is usually able to address disputes very
quickly.
The Act made compulsory takeovers necessary when a bidder purchased 75% of
the value of a company’s outstanding stock. Also, bids that seek to acquire 20% or more
of a company’s stock are not allowed except under certain circumstances such as a valid
takeover bid for the whole company. The law also sets forth disclosure rules relating to
bids while also requiring supplementary disclosures. Acquisitions of shares equal to or

96

Legal Framework
greater than 5% require disclosure of this holding. Bids must remain open for at least
one month but no more than one year. The bid price cannot be lower than the highest
price the bidder paid for any shares within the four-month period prior to the bid. In
addition, the Act places limits on the use of certain antitakeover defenses and some, such
as greenmail, are not allowed.
U.S. STATE CORPORATION LAWS AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES
In this section, we will review some major issues of U.S. state corporation laws and the
legal principles underlying some of the court rulings that have interpreted these laws.
Business Judgment Rule
The business judgment rule is the standard by which directors of corporations are judged
when they exercise their fiduciary duties in the course of an attempted takeover. Under
this standard it is presumed that directors act in a manner that is consistent with their
fiduciary obligations to shareholders. Thus, any party contesting this presumption must
conclusively demonstrate a breach of fiduciary duties. If the plaintiff in a U.S. action
against a company’s directors establishes this, then the burden shifts to the directors
to establish that the transaction was “entirely fair.” Specific court decisions have high-
lighted certain relevant issues regarding how directors must act when employing anti-
takeover defenses. Through these decisions, standards such as the Revlon duties and the
Unocal Standard have been developed.
Under Delaware law, directors’ duties pursuant to the business judgment rule are
that they should manage the affairs of the company by keeping three key duties in mind:
1. They have a duty of loyalty.
2. They have to demonstrate care for the interests of shareholders.
3. They should carry out their duties in a manner that is in the best interests of the
corporation and its shareholders.
In the context of M&A, the business judgment rule does not necessarily mean that
thetarget’sdirectorsneed to jump up and react emphatically to any bid that comesdown
the pike. They should be informed about the value of their company and the specifics
of the offer being presented. They do not have to go so far as to necessarily enter into
an active negotiation with the bidder and go back and forth with the bidder on how
the offer should be changed. On the other hand, they cannot simply close their eyes
to the bid and be uninformed about its financial characteristics and what merits it may
have for their shareholders.
Directors are sometimes targets of lawsuits even for deals which have been approved
by shareholders. Two recent Delaware court decisions have improved the legal position
of director defendants. In Singh v. Attenborough, the Delaware Supreme Court made it
easier for director defendants to obtain an early dismissal of claims against them if the

sale was an orderly one in which shareholders were fully informed and not coerced.26
Two months after that decision the Delaware Chancery Court extended those protec-
tions to two-step mergers done pursuant to Section 251(h) deals.27 We discuss such
deals in Chapter 6. As we will explain, this section of Delaware law allows for deals to go
through without a formal shareholder vote if the percentage of shareholders that would
have been necessary to win such a vote did tender their shares to the bidder. In effect,
the tender offer has a cleansing effect on the fairness of the deal.
Unocal Standard
In Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed the actions of the
Unocal board of directors as they implemented an antitakeover strategy to thwart the
unwanted tender offer by Mesa Petroleum, led by its colorful chief executive officer,
Boone Pickens.28 This strategy included a self-tender offer in which the target made a
tender offer for itself in competition with the offer initiated by the bidder. In reaching its
decision, the court noted its concern that directors may act in their own self-interest,
such as in this case, in which they were allegedly favoring the self-tender as opposed to
simply objectively searching for the best deal for shareholders. In such instances direc-
tors must demonstrate that they had reason to believe that there was a danger to the
pursuit of a corporate policy that was in the best interest of shareholders. In addition,
they must show that their actions were in the best interest of shareholders. Subsequent
courts have refined the Unocal Standard to feature a two-part responsibility:
1. Reasonableness test. The board must be able to clearly demonstrate that their actions
were reasonable in relation to their perceived beliefs about the danger to their corpo-
rate policies. For example, an inadequate price is considered a danger to corporate
policy.
2. Proportionality test. The board must also be able to demonstrate that their defen-
sive actions were in proportion to the magnitude of the perceived danger to their
policies.29
Once these standards are satisfied, the normal presumptions about director behav-
ior under the business judgment rule apply. When a board receives an offer from an
unwanted bidder and is determining whether to accept or reject it, the business judg-
ment rule is the operative standard. However, when they move from rejection to taking
active steps to fight off the bidder, then the Unocal Standard kicks in.
The standards of directors’ fiduciary duty that we have in the United States
sharply contrast with those of some other nations that have active takeover markets.
For example, the United Kingdom’s self-regulatory system in effect precludes the

development of a detailed case law on this issue, as such cases rarely reach the courts
in the United Kingdom.
Revlon Duties
In Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled on
what obligations a target board of directors have when faced with an offer for control of
their company.30 In this transaction, which is discussed further in Chapter 5 in the con-
text of lockup options, the court ruled that certain antitakeover defenses that favored
one bidder over another were invalid. The court determined that rather than promot-
ing the auction process, which should result in maximizing shareholder wealth, these
antitakeover defenses—a lockup option and a no-shop provision—inhibited rather than
promoted the auction process. Revlon duties come into play when it is clear that the sale
or breakup of the company is inevitable. At that time, directors have a responsibility
to maximize the gains for their shareholders. That is, they have a responsibility to shift
their focus away from actions that they normally would take to preserve the corporation
and its strategy to actions that will result in the greatest gains for shareholders, such as
making sure they get the highest bid possible for shareholders.
In reaching its decision rendering the lockup options and no-shop provisions
invalid, the court did not go so far as to say that the use of defenses per se was invalid.
The use of defenses that might favor one bidder over another could be consistent with
the board’s Revlon duties if they promoted the auction process by enabling one bidder to
be more competitive with another bidder, thereby causing offer prices to rise. However,
defenses that hinder the auction process are not valid. The court also did not go so far
as to require target boards to solicit bids and actively shop the company. In failing to
do so, the court chose not to narrowly circumscribe the actions that target boards can
take. However, in its decision the court implied that directors should have a good reason
for not considering an auction process.
It is important to note that Revlon duties do not require the target’s board to con-
duct an actual formal auction although that could be preferable. When directors can
demonstrate that they possess reliable information about the market value of the target
that may be sufficient.31

Blasius Standard of Review
In 1988, the Delaware Chancery Court put forward the “compelling justification”
standard, which supported a target board’s decision to take actions to limit a dissident

shareholder’s abilities to elect a majority of the board.33 In combination with the Unocal
Standard, these decisions give significant power to a target’s board, which opens the
door to potential abuse of power.34
The Blasius Standard was clarified in later decisions in which the Delaware
Chancery court noted that it would carefully scrutinize a board’s decisions to ensure
that shareholders’ rights were upheld by a board’s actions and that a board would
not abuse its discretion to disenfranchise shareholders. In the 2007 case of Mercer v.
Inter-Tel, the Delaware Chancery Court found that the board of directors had “com-
pelling justification” to postpone a shareholders’ meeting to prevent the defeat of a
merger proposal.35 However, the Delaware court’s concern about an abuse of the Unocal
and Blasius standards were underscored in other cases such as Portnoy v. Cryo-Cell
International, wherein the Delaware court noted that if shareholders’ interests were
thwarted by a board, it would grant shareholders relief.36
Entire Fairness Standard
When directors are considering taking steps to approve the sale of a company or taking
actions to oppose a bid, they need to be mindful that a Delaware court will seek to deter-
mine if their decisions were entirely fair to shareholders.37 The Delaware courts have
agreed that there is no simple bright-line rule and that each matter brings with it its
own unique factors that may be relevant to the overall fairness of the transaction or the
actions that were taken to stop the deal.
STATE ANTITAKEOVER LAWS
Many non-Americans are confused and dismayed by the sometimes-conflicting com-
bination of federal laws and state laws that characterizes the U.S. legal system. Indeed,
under current federal and state takeover laws, it is possible that conforming to some
aspects of federal laws means violating certain state laws. The line of demarcation
between federal takeover laws and their state counterparts has to do with the focus
of each. Federal laws tend to be directed at securities regulation, tender offers, and
antitrust considerations, whereas state laws govern corporate charters and their
bylaws. Currently, a broad array of inconsistent state laws exists across the United
States. Many of these laws were passed in response to pressure by particular corpo-
rations that found themselves the object of interest by potential acquirers. The usual
scenario is that a local firm petitions the state legislature to pass an antitakeover law or
amend the current one to make it more difficult for a local corporation to be taken over.

Legal Framework
The political pressure that is brought to bear on the state legislature comes in the form
of allegations that a takeover by a “foreign raider” will mean a significant loss of jobs
as well as other forms of community support, such as charitable donations by the local
corporation.
The system of differing state laws is not unique to the United States. The EU has
worked to have a common set of merger rules but has achieved approval of only a limited
set of rules. Given that EU countries have the right to opt out of the new EU merger rules
and then apply their own differing country-specific laws, the situation in the EU is in
some respects somewhat analogous to what we have in the United States.
In the United States and the United Kingdom, laws emphasize the rights of share-
holders (although more so in the United Kingdom), whereas in certain European
countries, such as Austria, Germany, France, and Italy, the rights of creditors are
emphasized more. In addition, shareholdings are less concentrated in the hands of
families and insiders in the United States and the United Kingdom. To a certain extent,
this helps explain why the laws have evolved differently in these two nations. In
addition, while there are many similarities in the securities markets and laws of the
United States and the United Kingdom, there are significant differences. For example,
many U.S. states allow management to engage in aggressive antitakeover defensive
actions, while UK laws forbid management from engaging in such evasive actions
without shareholder approval.
Genesis of State Antitakeover Laws in the United States
The first state to adopt an antitakeover law was Virginia in 1968, with many states
following thereafter. These statutes typically required that disclosure materials be filed
following the initiation of the bid. The problem with these “first-generation” state anti-
takeover laws was that they applied to firms that did only a small amount of business in
that state. This seemed unfair to bidding corporations. Thus, the stage was set for a legal
challenge.
Key Court Decisions Relating to Antitakeover Laws
Certain court decisions have defined the types of state antitakeover laws that are accept-
able and those that are not. These decisions, which were recorded in the 1980s, are still
relevant today.
Edgar v. MITE
The constitutionality of these first-generation antitakeover laws was successfully
challenged in 1982, in the famous Edgar v. MITE decision.38 In this decision, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that the Illinois Business Takeover Act was unconstitutional on
the grounds that it violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Illinois
law was extraterritorial in nature in that it permitted the state to block a nationwide
38 Edgar v. MITE Corporation, 102 S. Ct. 2629 (1982). Prior to this decision, in 1978, the Fifth Circuit found
these statutes objectionable in Great Western United Corp. v. Kidwell, 577 F. 2d 1256 (5th cir. 1978).

tender offer for a state-affiliated target corporation if the bidder failed to comply with
the disclosure laws of Illinois.
The challenge to the Illinois law caused states with similar laws to question their
constitutionality and redevelop their provisions. The states still wanted to inhibit
takeovers, which they thought were not in the best interest of the states, but now they
had to adopt a different approach, which came in the form of the “second-generation”
laws. The second-generation state antitakeover laws had a narrower focus than the
first-generation laws. They tended to apply only to those firms that were incorporated
within the state or that conducted a substantial part of their business activities within
state boundaries. They were not directed at regulating disclosure in tender offers, as
the first-generation laws were. Rather, they focused on issues of corporate governance,
which traditionally are the domain of state corporation laws.
Dynamics v. CTS
The Edgar v. MITE decision delivered a severe blow to the first-generation laws. Many
opponents of antitakeover legislation attacked the second-generation laws, which they
believed were also unconstitutional. These legal actions resulted in the Dynamics v. CTS
decision of April 1987.39 In this case, the CTS Corporation used the Indiana law to fight
off a takeover by the Dynamics Corporation. Dynamics challenged the law, contending
that it was unconstitutional. In Dynamics v. CTS, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Indiana antitakeover law, which was a control share statute, was constitutional. This
law allows stockholders to vote on whether a buyer of controlling interest can exercise
his or her voting rights. The CTS decision gave the Supreme Court’s approval to the
second-generation state takeover laws. Since the April 1987 CTS decision, many states
have adopted antitakeover laws. Today most states have some kind of law regulating
takeovers.
Amanda Acquisition Corporation v. Universal Foods Corporation
In November 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to the Wisconsin
antitakeover law.40 The Court’s unwillingness to hear this challenge further buttressed
the legal viability of state antitakeover laws. The Wisconsin law requires a bidder who
acquires 10% or more of a target company’s stock to receive the approval of the other
target shareholders or wait three years to complete the merger. The three-year waiting
period makes heavily leveraged buyouts, which were typical of the fourth merger wave,
prohibitively expensive.
The Supreme Court decision arose from a legal challenge by the Amanda Acquisi-
tion Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the Boston-based High Voltage Engineering
Corporation. Amanda challenged the Wisconsin law that prevented it from proceeding
with a tender offer for the Milwaukee-based Universal Foods Corporation. The direc-
tors of Universal Foods opposed the takeover and reacted by using what has been called
39 Dynamics Corporation of America v. CTS Corporation, 637 F. Supp. 406 (N.D. Ill. 1986).
40 Amanda Acquisition Corp. v. Universal Foods Corp., 877 F.2d 496 (7th Cir. 1989).

the just-say-no defense. Amanda charged that the Wisconsin law was an interference
with interstate commerce and was harmful to shareholders. The Supreme Court failed
to agree and refused to hear the challenge to the law. The Court’s position in this case
reaffirms the Dynamics v. CTS decision that upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana
antitakeover law in 1987.
Under Delaware law if the target board conducts a reasonable investigation and
comes to the good faith conclusion that an unsolicited bid is not in the best interests of its
shareholders, it may simply Say No and not redeem a poison pill defense. For example,
this was the case in Moore Corp. v Wallace, where Wallace’s board contended that the
results of its recent capital investments were just starting to bear fruit, and it did not
even want to let shareholders tender their shares to Moore in what they considered to
be an offer that did not reflect these investments. Thus, Wallace’s board was able to suc-
cessfully Just Say No to the “threat” Moore’s offer represented.
Legality of Poison Pills
In Chapter 5, we discuss poison pills, or what are called shareholder rights plans,
in detail. As part of that material we discuss the various cases, such as Moran v.
Household International and Air Products v. Airgas. However, the bottom line of these
Delaware decisions is that poison pills are a legitimate defense when they are used by
diligent directors who perceive that an unwanted bid is not in the best interest of their
shareholders.
Components of Second-Generation Laws
Most second-generation laws incorporate some or all of the following provisions:
◾
Fair price provision
◾
Business combination provision
◾
Control share provision
◾
Cash-out statute
Fair Price Provision
A fair price provision requires that in a successful tender offer all shareholders who do
not decide to sell will receive the same price as shareholders who do accept the offer.
These provisions are designed to prevent the abuses that may occur in two-tiered tender
offers. With two-tiered bids, a high price is offered to the first-tier tenders, whereas a
lowerpriceorlessadvantageousterms(e.g.,securitiesofuncertainvalueinsteadofcash)
are offered to the members of the second tier.
Business Combination Provision
This provision prevents business agreements between the target company and the
bidding company for a certain time period. For example, the wording of a business
combination provision may rule out the sales of the target’s assets by the bidding

103
company. These provisions are designed to prevent leveraged hostile acquisitions.
When an acquiring company assumes a large amount of debt to finance a takeover, it
may be relying on the sales of assets by the target to pay the high interest payments
required by the debt. The law is designed to prevent the transformation of local firms,
with a low-risk capital structure, into riskier leveraged companies.
Control Share Provision
Some states, such as Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, have control share statutes,
while others, such as Delaware, do not. A control share provision requires that acquir-
ing firms obtain prior approval of current target stockholders before the purchases are
allowed. These provisions typically apply to stock purchases beyond a certain percentage
of the outstanding stock. They are particularly effective if the current share ownership
includes large blocks of stock that are held by groups of people who are generally sup-
portive of management, such as employee stockholders.
Essentially control share statutes limit “creeping acquisitions” above a certain
threshold, such as 20%. Once the threshold has been crossed, the control shareholder
must get the approval of the other shares prior to exercising its votes associated with
the shares it owns.
Bidders do not necessarily dislike control share statutes. In effect, they can serve
as an early referendum on the possibility of a bid. In addition, shareholders often
do not want to eliminate the possibility of getting a good takeover premium, so they
may not vote against the bidder. If that is the result, then the bidder can use the vote to
put pressure on the target’s board by citing that shareholders support the bidder and
not the board. So, ironically, the bidder may actually call for the vote.
Cash-Out Statute
This provision, like the fair price requirement, is designed to limit tender offers. It typ-
ically requires that if a bidder buys a certain percentage of stock in a target firm, the
bidder is then required to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares at the same
terms given to the initial purchase. This provision limits acquiring firms that lack the
financial resources for a 100% stock acquisition. It also limits leveraged acquisitions
because it may require the bidder to assume an even greater amount of debt with the
associated high debt service. Bidders might therefore be discouraged because of their
inability to obtain financing for a 100% purchase or simply because they do not believe
their cash flow will service the increased debt.
Constituency Provisions
Some state laws (but not Delaware) also have constituency provisions, which allow the
board to take into account the impact a deal may have on other relevant stakeholders,
such as workers or the community. This is not a powerful tool in the face of an offer that
is clearly in the financial interests of shareholders. However, it may give the board an
additional, albeit secondary, point to raise after they assert that the offer is inadequate.

104
◾
Legal Framework
Delaware Antitakeover Law
The Delaware Antitakeover Law is probably the most important of all the state anti-
takeover laws because more corporations are incorporated in Delaware than in any
other state. General Motors, Exxon Mobil, Wal-Mart, and DuPont are among the
850,000 companies that have incorporated in Delaware. One-half of all publicly traded
companies are incorporated there, along with 63% of the Fortune 500 companies.
There is a clear preference on the part of companies to incorporate in Delaware.
It has often been assumed that the reason for the preference for Delaware is that it
has a well-developed body of law and a sophisticated court system.41 Delaware’s court
system utilizes very knowledgeable judges to decide corporate lawsuits, as opposed
to juries.
Another explanation for the preference for Delaware is that Delaware’s incor-
poration fees are cheaper than all but eight other states. Still, the fee difference is
not significant enough to explain the preference for Delaware.42 Another desirable
characteristic of Delaware that contributes to its popularity is the fact that companies
and their shareholders do not need to be a resident of the state to incorporate there. In
addition, non-Delaware businesses do not have to pay Delaware corporate taxes even if
they are incorporated in that state.
Bebchuk and Cohen have shown that having an antitakeover law in place was an
important factor in state incorporation decisions.43 Robert Anderson found that one of
the most important factors influencing a company’s decision on where to incorporate
was what law firm was representing the company around the time when the firm was
formed.44 When the law firm is a major national firm, the choice is typically Delaware.
However, when the law firm is mainly a local firm, the choice is often incorporating in
that particular state.
Delaware wasrelatively lateinadopting anantitakeoverlaw. Itslaw, whichissimilar
to the Wisconsin law but less restrictive, was passed in 1988, but was made retroac-
tive to December 23, 1987, the day before corporate raider Carl Icahn acquired 15%
of Texaco Corporation. The law was passed in response to an intense lobbying effort by
companies seeking to adopt a protective statute. They threatened that if such a protec-
tive statute was not passed, they would reincorporate in states that did have antitakeover
laws. The fact that incorporation fees account for nearly 20% of the Delaware state bud-
get underscored the importance of this threat.45 The choice of the effective date testifies
to the power of this lobbying effort. The law stipulates that an unwanted bidder who

buys more than 15% of a target company’s stock may not complete the takeover for
three years except under the following conditions:46
◾
If the buyer buys 85% or more of the target company’s stock. This 85% figure may
not include the stock held by directors or the stock held in employee stock ownership
plans.
◾
If two-thirds of the stockholders approve the acquisition.
◾
If the board of directors and the stockholders decide to waive the antitakeover pro-
visions of this law.
Being primarily a business combination statute (Section 203 of Delaware Corpo-
ration Law), the law is designed to limit takeovers financed by debt. Raiders who have
financed their takeovers by large amounts of debt often need to sell off company assets
and divisions to pay off the debt. The need to pay off the debt quickly becomes significant
in the case of the billion-dollar takeover, as in the 1980s, when interest payments were
as much as half a million dollars per day. Although the Delaware law might discourage
some debt-financed takeovers, it is not very effective against cash offers. Moreover, even
debt-financed offers at a very attractive price may be sufficiently appealing for stockhold-
ers to waive the antitakeover provisions of the law.
Wealth Effects of State Antitakeover Laws
In a study of 40 state antitakeover bills introduced between 1982 and 1987, Karpoff and
Malatesta found a small but statistically significant decrease in stock prices of compa-
nies incorporated in the various states contemplating passage of such laws.47 They even
found that companies doing significant business in these states also suffered a decline in
stock prices. Szewczyk and Tsetsekos found that Pennsylvania firms lost $4 billion dur-
ing the time this state’s antitakeover law was being considered and adopted.48 It should
be kept in mind, however, that these are short-term effects based on the reactions of
traders in the market during that time period.
Comment and Schwert analyzed a large sample of takeovers in an effort to deter-
mine the impact of both the passage of state antitakeover laws and the adoption of poison
pills.49 They did not find that the laws significantly deterred takeovers. In fact, they
foundthattheeffectsofthelawsandpoisonpillsservedtoenhancethebargainingpower

Bertrand and Mullainathan examined the possible effects of the passage of

likelihood that management would build new plants and close older ones.50 They
found that after the passage of such laws both blue- and white-collar wages went
up—especially white-collar wages. However, they also found that these higher wages do
not “pay for themselves,” as operational efficiency was lower in the post-passage years,
in which there was a decline in plant creation and destruction. The authors conclude
that maybe the protection of the laws insulates entrenched managers to “live the quiet
life,” which may come at the expense of shareholders, although not of workers.
Giroud and Mueller analyzed the impact of the passage of 30 business combina-
tion statutes on the operating performance of companies in those states.51 They found
that operating performance deteriorated after the passage of these laws in industries that
were not competitive while this did not occur in competitive industries. In noncompeti-
tiveindustries,inputcosts,wages,andoverheadincreased.Thisimpliesthatcompetition
can help reduce “managerial slack.” It was also noteworthy that they found that the
market correctly anticipated these effects. Share prices tended to fall after the passage of
the laws for companies in noncompetitive industries but not for companies in competi-
tive industries.
More recently, Cain, McKeon, and Solomon looked at the long-term relationship
between hostile takeovers and the passage of 17 different takeover laws over the period
1965–2014.52 Their results are not consistent with some of the prior research in this
area. For example, they do not find significant wealth effects from the passage of busi-
ness combination statutes, whereas they do find that fair price statutes were associated
with reduced takeover activity, which, in turn, translates to fewer takeover premiums.
In general, they found that greater takeover protection was associated with lower firm
values. However, for firms that received a bid, greater protection was associated with
higher takeover premiums—a result consistent with prior research.
Cost of Capital, Performance, and State Antitakeover Laws
From a theoretical perspective, there are several ways that the protections from the
market for corporate control could affect the costs of capital and in particular the costs
of debt. Takeovers may work to keep management “on their toes” and force them to
generate better performance, lest the stock price slip and they become vulnerable
to takeovers. In addition there can be a coinsurance effect whereby postacquisition
companies are larger and possibly less risky. On the other hand, as we will discuss in
Chapter 8, there could also be an increased leverage effect where the postacquisition
company has more debt and bondholder wealth declines, although seller shareholders
may have realized a premium.

Qiu and Yu analyzed the costs of debt capital in relation to an exogenous
shock—the passage of business combination statutes during the period 1985–1991.53
They measured the costs of debt using the spread between comparable corporate
debt and Treasury securities. They found that the passage of such laws resulted in
a 28-basis-point increase in the costs of debt. However, consistent with the research
of Giroud and Mueller, they found that these effects were not present in competitive
industries where, presumably, competitive pressures serve to lower managerial slack.54
Giroud and Mueller examined company performance before and after the passage of
business combination statutes and found that performance worsened in noncompetitive
industries but had little effect in competitive ones.
TIME-WARNER–PARAMOUNT
I
n March 1989, Time Inc. entered into a merger agreement with Warner Commu-
nications Inc. The deal was a planned stock-for-stock exchange that would be put
before the shareholders of both companies for their approval. Paramount Commu-
nications Inc. then entered the fray with a hostile tender offer for Time. This offer
was structured by Paramount to be higher than the valuation that was inherent to
the original Time-Warner agreement. Time then responded with a tender offer for
Warner that featured a cash offer for 51% of Warner, followed by a second-step
transaction using securities as consideration.
Paramount sued and contended that the original merger agreement between
Time and Warner meant that there was an impending change in control, thereby
bringing the Revlon duties of the directors into play. In Paramount Communications,
Inc. v. Time, Inc., the court rejected Paramount’s argument that there would be a
change in control.a The court was impressed by the fact that both companies
were public and their shares were widely held. Based on such reasoning, the court
concluded that this was not an acquisition in which one company was acquiring
another but rather, a strategic merger. Therefore, Revlon duties were not triggered,
and the normal business judgment rule standard applied.
The signiﬁcance of this decision is that the announcement of a strategic merger
between two companies is not a signal that either of the companies is for sale.
Therefore, the directors do not have to consider other offers as if there were an
auction process. This implies that if there is an unwanted bid, the directors may
consider the use of antitakeover measures to avoid the hostile bid while they go
ahead with the strategic merger.

Legal Framework
REGULATION OF INSIDER TRADING
The SEC rules specify remedies for shareholders who incur losses resulting from insider
trading. Insiders are bound by SEC Rule 10b-5, which states that insiders must “disclose
or abstain” from trading the firm’s securities. The rule derives from an SEC response
to a complaint filed in the 1940s that a company provided indications that earnings
would be weak while it planned to announce much stronger performance and the com-
pany’s president purchased shares while knowing the true earnings. It was not until
two decades later that the SEC notified the market that it would bring civil claims under
this little-known rule. However, it was not until the late 1970s that the SEC and federal
prosecutors used the rule to bring criminal lawsuits.
Insider trading regulation was buttressed by the passage of the Insider Trading and
Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988. This law imposed maximum penalties of
up to $1 million and up to 10 years in prison while also setting up a bounty program
whereby informants could collect up to 10% of the insider’s profits. It also established
the possibility of top management’s being liable for the insider trading of subordinates.
In the wake of Enron, the Sarbanes-Oxley law increased the maximum penalty for
insider trading to $5 million and a possible jail sentence of up to 20 years.
The 1988 law followed the passage of the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984,
which gave the SEC the power to seek treble damages for trading on inside informa-
tion. This law provided a dual-pronged approach for regulators, who now could seek
civil remedies in addition to the criminal alternatives that were available before the pas-
sage of the 1984 act. Illegal insider trading may occur, for example, if insiders, acting
on information that is unavailable to other investors, sell the firm’s securities before an
announcement of poor performance. Other investors, unaware of the upcoming bad
news, may pay a higher price for the firm’s securities. The opposite might be the case
if insiders bought the firm’s stock or call options before the announcement of a bid from
another firm. Stockholders might not have sold the shares to the insiders if they had
known of the upcoming bid and its associated premium.
Who Are Insiders?
Insiders may be defined more broadly than the management of a company. They may
include outsiders, such as attorneys, investment bankers, financial printers, or consul-
tants, who can be considered “temporary insiders.” Under Rule 10b-5, however, the U.S.
Supreme Court held that outside parties who trade profitably based on their acquired
information did not have to disclose their inside information. This was the case in the
1980 Chiarella v. United States, in which a financial printer acquired information on
an upcoming tender offer by reviewing documents in his print shop.55 If an individ-
ual misappropriates confidential information on a merger or acquisition and uses it as
the basis for trade, however, Rule 10b-5 will apply. The rule is applicable only to SEC
enforcement proceedings or criminal actions, but not to civil actions under the Insider
55 Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 100 S. Ct. 1108, 63 L.Ed.2d, 348 (1980).

Regulation of Insider Trading
◾
109
Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, which permits the recovery of treble damages on the
profits earned or the loss avoided.
A classic example of illegal insider trading was the famous Texas Gulf Sulphur case.
In 1963, Texas Gulf Sulphur discovered certain valuable mineral deposits, which it did
not disclose for several months; actually, the firm publicly denied the discovery in a false
press release. Meanwhile, officers and directors bought undervalued shares based on
their inside information. The SEC successfully brought a suit against the insiders. The
short swing profit rule prohibits any officer, director, or owner of 10% of a company’s
stockfromapurchaseandsale,orasaleandpurchase,withinasix-monthperiod.Profits
derived from these transactions must be paid to the issuer even if the transactions were
not made on the basis of insider information.
When Does an Insider Trading Violation Occur?
The mere provision of insider information by a tipper to another party, a tippee, does
not necessarily constitute a violation for which the tipper would be subject to penalties
related to insider trading laws.56 There has to be a personal benefit derived by the tipper.
This was clarified in 2017 with the Salman decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court
concluded that a tipper giving such valuable information to a family member or friend
could be considered to have derived a benefit even if there was no monetary exchange.57
Do Insider Trading Laws Effectively Deter Insider Trading?
One research study by Nejat Seyhun has questioned the effectiveness of laws in curb-
ing insider trading.58 In addition, Lisa Meulbroek empirically confirmed that stock price
run-ups before takeover announcements do reflect insider trading.59 Other research
seems to indicate that such laws may have a significant deterrent effect. Jon Garfinkel
examinedinsidertradingaroundearningsannouncementsandfoundthatafterthepas-
sage of the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act, insiders appeared to
adjust the timing of their transactions so that the trades occurred after the release of the
relevant information.60 The fact that the laws and the enforcement activity do seem to
have a positive effect does not negate the fact that insider trading seems to remain a part
of merger and acquisition activity of public companies.
This conclusion was underscored in more recent research that examined trading
in call and put options prior to M&A announcements. Augustin, Brenner, and Subrah-
manyam found statistically significant abnormal trading volume in U.S. equity options
over a 30-day period prior to M&A announcements.61 The researchers examined the
56 Dirks v. SEC, 463 U.S., 463 U.S. 646, 653-654, 103 S. Ct. 3255, 77 L. Ed. 2d 911 (1983).

randomly selected days. Their sample consisted of 1,859 corporate transactions over
the period 1996–2012. The fact that M&As should be unexpected would imply that
there should not be a statistically significant difference in the trading volume. This was
definitely not the case as the volume preceding M&A announcements was significantly
greater. The fact that this occurred so often in their sample also implies that, while the
SEC has made great efforts to publicize its insider trading enforcement actions in some
high-profile cases, the evidence from these researchers implies that M&A-related insider
trading is not only quite prevalent but also largely unpunished by the SEC. This is clearly

ANTITRUST LAWS
The ability to merge with or acquire other firms is limited by antitrust legislation. Var-
ious antitrust laws are designed to prevent firms from reducing competition through
mergers. Many mergers are never attempted simply because of the likelihood of govern-
mental intervention on antitrust grounds. Other mergers are halted when it becomes
apparent that the government will likely oppose the merger.
The U.S. government has changed its stance on the antitrust ramifications of
mergers several times since 1890. As noted previously, in recent years the govern-
ment’s attitude has been evolving toward a freer market view, which favors a more
limited government role in the marketplace. Although many horizontal mergers were
opposed during the 1980s, many others proceeded unopposed. This is in sharp contrast
to the government’s earlier position in the 1960s. During that period, mergers and
acquisitions involving businesses only remotely similar to the acquiring firm’s business
were often opposed on antitrust grounds. This situation encouraged large numbers of
conglomerate mergers, which generally were not opposed.
In addition to the enforcement agencies changing their stance on antitrust
enforcement, changes in market conditions sometimes render deals that would have
been objectionable in one time period acceptable in another. For example, in 1997
the Federal Trade Commission objected to a merger between Staples and Office Depot.
Sixteen years later, in 2013, the market had changed greatly, with competitors such as
Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Costco selling office supplies and taking market share from the
large office supply companies. Based on this, the merger of the number-two company,
Office Depot, and the number-three, Office Max, was allowed.
Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890
The Sherman Antitrust Act is the cornerstone of all U.S. antitrust laws. The first two
sections of the law contain its most important provisions:
Section 1 This section prohibits all contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in
restraint of trade.
Section 2 This section prohibits any attempts or conspiracies to monopolize a particu-
lar industry.

Antitrust Laws
◾
111
The Sherman Act made the formation of monopolies and other attempts to restrain
trade unlawful and criminal offenses punishable under federal law. The government or
the injured party can file suit under this law, and the court can then decide the appropri-
ate punishment, which may range from an injunction to more severe penalties, includ-
ing triple damages and imprisonment. The first two sections of the Sherman Act make it
immediately clear that it is written broadly enough to cover almost all types of anticom-
petitive activities. Surprisingly, however, the first great merger wave took place following
thepassageofthelaw.Thisfirstmergerwave,whichtookplacebetween1897and1904,
was characterized by the formation of monopolies. The resulting increased concentra-
tion in many industries, combined with the formation of many powerful monopolies,
revealed that the Act was not performing the functions its first two sections implied.
The apparent ineffectiveness of the Sherman Act was partly due to the law’s
wording. Specifically, it stated that all contracts that restrained trade were illegal. In
its early interpretations, however, the court reasonably refused to enforce this part
of the law on the basis that this implies that almost all contracts could be considered
illegal. The court had difficulty finding an effective substitute. Court rulings such as
the 1895 Supreme Court ruling that the American Sugar Refining Company was not a
monopoly in restraint of trade made the law a dead letter for more than a decade after
its passage. The lack of government resources also made it difficult for the government
to enforce the law. While a dead letter under President McKinley, the law started to have
more impact on the business community under the pressure of trustbusting President
Theodore Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft. In an effort to correct
the deficiencies associated with the wording of the law and the lack of an enforcement
agency, the government decided to make a more explicit statement of its antitrust
position. This effort came with the passage of the Clayton Act.
Clayton Act of 1914
The goal of the Clayton Act was to strengthen the Sherman Act while also specifically
proscribing certain business practices. The Clayton Act did not prohibit any activities
that were not already illegal under a broad interpretation of the Sherman Act. The Clay-
ton Act, however, clarified which business practices unfairly restrain trade and reduce
competition. The bill did not address the problem of the lack of an enforcement agency
charged with the specific responsibility for enforcing the antitrust laws.
Section 7 is particularly relevant to M&As: “No corporation shall acquire the whole
or any part of the stock, or the whole or any part of the assets, of another corporation
where in any line of commerce in any section of the country the effect of such an acquisition
may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.”
Originally, the Clayton Act focused only on the acquisition of stock. However, this
loophole was closed in 1950 to also include asset acquisitions.
Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914
One weakness of the Sherman Act was that it did not give the government an effective
enforcement agency to investigate and pursue antitrust violations. At that time, the Jus-
tice Department did not possess the resources to be an effective antitrust deterrent. In an
effort to address this problem, the Federal Trade Commission Act, which was passed in

112
◾
Legal Framework
1914, established the FTC. The FTC was charged with enforcing both the Federal Trade
Commission Act and the Clayton Act. In particular, the FTC Act was passed with the
intention of creating an enforcement arm for the Clayton Act. The main antitrust pro-
vision of the Act is Section 5, which prohibits unfair methods of competition. Although
the FTC was given the power to initiate antitrust lawsuits, it was not given a role in the
criminal enforcement of antitrust violations. The Act also broadened the range of illegal
business activities beyond those mentioned in the Clayton Act.
Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950
Until the passage of the Celler-Kefauver Act, companies used the “asset loophole” to
effect acquisitions while not buying the target’s stock. This loophole was eliminated by
thepassageoftheCeller-KefauverActof1950,whichprohibitedtheacquisitionofassets
of a target firm when the effect was to lessen competition. The Celler-Kefauver Act also
prohibited vertical mergers and conglomerate mergers when they were shown to reduce
competition. The previous antitrust laws were aimed at horizontal mergers, which are
combinations of firms producing the same product. The Celler-Kefauver Act set the stage
for the aggressive antitrust enforcement of the 1960s.
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
Even though we went through two decades of vigorous antitrust enforcements in the
United States, it was not until the passage of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improve-
ments Act in 1976 (HSR) that the power of the two antitrust enforcement agencies, the
Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, really increased. Prior to this
law, the enforcement agencies did not have the power to require third parties, the com-
petitors of the merging companies, to provide them with their private economic data.
This led the enforcement agencies to drop many investigations due to the lack of hard
economic data. As we will discuss, HSR gave the Justice Department the right to issue
“Civil Investigative Demands” to the merging companies but also third parties to gather
data prior to filing a complaint. In addition, it was not until the passage of HSR that
the government could require the postponement of proposed M&As until the authorities
gave their approval of the deal.
HSRrequiresthattheBureauofCompetitionoftheFTCandtheAntitrustDivisionof
the Justice Department be given the opportunity to review proposed M&As in advance.
According to the Act, an acquisition or merger may not be consummated until these
authorities have reviewed the transaction. These two agencies must decide which of
the two will investigate the particular transaction. The law prevents consummation of a
merger until the end of the specified waiting periods. Therefore, failure to file in a timely
manner may delay completion of the transaction.
HSR was passed to prevent the consummation of transactions that would ulti-
mately be judged to be anticompetitive. Thus, the Justice Department would be able
to avoid disassembling a company that had been formed in part through an anticom-
petitive merger or acquisition. This process is sometimes euphemistically referred to as
“unscrambling” eggs.

Antitrust Laws
◾
113
The law became necessary because of the government’s inability to halt
transactions through the granting of injunctive relief while it attempted to rule
on the competitive effects of the business combination. When injunctive relief was not
obtainable, mandated divestiture, designed to restore competition, might not take place
for many years after the original acquisition or merger. HSR was written to prevent
these problems before they occurred. It added another layer of regulation and a waiting
period for tender offers beyond what was already in place with the Williams Act.
Whether antitrust approval actually slows down a tender offer depends on the actual
length of time it takes to receive the antitrust green light.
Size Requirements for Filing
Small M&As are less likely to have anticompetitive effects, so the law established
size thresholds for filing. These thresholds are divided into size-of-transaction and
size-of-person levels. Failure to file can result in monetary penalties of $16,000 for each
day the filing is late.
Size-of-Transaction Threshold
As of 2017, the size-of-transaction threshold is met if the buyer is acquiring voting secu-
rities or assets of $80.8 million or more. Deals above that level require a filing, and there
is no HSR filing requirement for smaller deals. However, we also have the size-of-person
threshold.
Size-of-Person Threshold
The size-of-person test is met if one party to a transaction has $161.5 million or
more in sales or assets and the other has $16.2 million or more in sales and assets.
However, all deals valued at $32 million or more have to be reported regardless of the
size-of-person test.
It is important to note that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commis-
sion still have the authority under the Sherman Act and the Federal Trade Commission
Act to challenge an M&A on antitrust grounds even if a filing is not required under HSR.
Deadlines for Filing
A bidder must file under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act as soon as it announces a tender
offer or any other offer. The target is then required to respond. This response comes in
the form of the target’s filing, which must take place 15 days after the bidder has filed.
Type of Information to Be Filed
The law requires the filing of a 15-page form, which can be downloaded from the Fed-
eral Trade Commission website.62 Business data describing the business activities and
revenues of the acquiring and the target firms’ operations must be provided according
62 www.ftc.gov/bc/hsr/hsrform.shtm.

114

Legal Framework
to North American Industrial Classification System (“NAICS”) codes. Most firms already
have this information because it must be submitted to the U.S. Bureau of the Census. In
addition, when filing, the acquiring firm must attach certain reports it may have com-
piled to analyze the competitive effects of this transaction.
This presents an interesting conflict. When a transaction is first being proposed
within the acquiring firm, its proponents may tend to exaggerate its benefits. If this exag-
gerationcomesintheformofpresentingahighermarketsharethanwhatmightbemore
realistic, the firm’s ability to attain antitrust approval may be hindered. For this reason,
when the firm is preparing its premerger reports, it must keep the antitrust approval
in mind.
The filing is not made public, although agencies may disclose some information if
the deal has been publicly announced. Along with the necessary data the filing party
must pay a fee, which is greater the larger the size of the transaction.
Filing Time Requirements
HSR provides for a 30-day waiting period unless the deal is a cash tender offer or
bankruptcy sale, in which case the waiting period is 15 days. If either the Justice
Department or the Federal Trade Commission determines that a closer inquiry is
necessary, it may put forward a second request for information. This second request
extends to a waiting period of 30 days, except for 10 days in the case of cash tender
offers or bankruptcy sales.
Most filing companies request an early termination of the waiting period on the
grounds that there clearly are no anticompetitive effects. Most of these requests are
granted. However, some investigations can be lengthy. It was not until January 2010,
one year after the proposed merger between Ticketmaster, one of the world’s largest
event ticketing companies, and Live Nation, the world’s largest concert promoter, was
announced, that the Justice Department finally gave its approval. Christine Varney,
then head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, refused to give approval until
the companies agreed to a combination of divestitures and behavioral prohibitions.
Ticketmaster had to agree to divest itself of one of its ticketing divisions. In addition, the
combined company had to agree to 10 years of “antiretaliation provisions,” which seek
to prevent the company from abusing its increased power in the concert business.
Disclosure of HSR Filing
Technically, an HSR filing is a confidential filing with the government and is not meant
for public disclosure. However, because the target company receives notice and has to
respondtothegovernment,thetargetismadeawareofthebidder’sintentions.Thisisdif-
ferent fromthedisclosuresrequired fortenderoffersthat aredesigned to notify thetarget
company and the market of the bidder’s intentions, and so on. In addition, if the target
applies for early termination of the HSR review process, then, if approved, the antitrust
authorities will publish the early termination decision and the market is thereby made
aware of the offer.

115
Signiﬁcance of Notice of Government Opposition
If the Justice Department files suit to block a proposed acquisition, that usually is the end
of the deal. Even if the bidder and the target believe that they might ultimately prevail
in the lawsuit, it may not be in either company’s interest to become embroiled in a pro-
tracted legal battle with the government that may last years. Such was the case in 2017,
when Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid Corp. dropped their planned $9.4 billion
merger as they could not gain FTC approval. Instead Walgreens indicated it would try to
do a smaller deal—buying some of the Rite Aid stores.
Federal Trade Commission Rules on Creeping Acquisitions
The FTC has set forth various rules that refine the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. These rules
address the creeping acquisition, which is a situation in which an acquirer eventually
accumulates a total holding that may be anticompetitive but where the individual
share acquisitions are not by themselves anticompetitive. They also eliminate the need
for repeated filings for each share acquisition beyond the original one that may have
required a filing. These rules indicate that a purchaser does not have to file for addi-
tional purchases if, during a five-year period after the expiration of the original filing
requirement period, the total share purchase does not reach 25% of the outstanding
shares of the issuer. If there are continued purchases after the 25% level that required
an additional filing, the purchaser does not have to file again until the 50% threshold is
reached.
FTC Rules for Second Requests and Speed of Takeover Completion
A second request is often dreaded by M&A participants, as it means delays and signif-
icant increases in expenses. Such requests often require as many as a million pages of
documents to be provided by the companies. In 2006, the FTC announced new rules
that give companies the option to agree to extend the deadline for an FTC decision to
30 days after the company has certified it is in compliance with the FTC’s data requests.
In these circumstances, the FTC agrees to place certain limits, such as confining the
data requested to two years and limiting the number of employees whose files can be
searched to 35.
Exemptions to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
Certain acquisitions supervised by governmental agencies, as well as certain foreign
acquisitions, are exempt fromthe requirementsof theHart-Scott-Rodino Act. The invest-
ment exception permits an individual to acquire up to 10% of an issuer’s voting securities
as long as the acquisition is solely for the purposes of investment. The investment excep-
tion is designed to exempt those buyers of securities who are passive investors and have
no interest in control. It allows investors to buy a large dollar amount of voting securities
in a particular company without having to adhere to the HSR filing requirement.
Another exception is the convertible securities exception. Securities that are con-
vertible into voting securities are exempt from the filing requirements of the HSR, as

116

are options and warrants. In addition to these exceptions, purchases by brokerage firms
are also exempt, assuming that these purchases are not being made for the purpose of
evading the law.
Enforcement of Antitrust Laws: Justice Department and Federal
Trade Commission Interaction
Both the Justice Department and the FTC share the responsibility for enforcing U.S.
antitrust laws. When the Justice Department brings a suit, it is heard in federal court,
whereas when the FTC initiates an action, it is heard before an administrative law judge
at the FTC and the decision is reviewed by the commissioners of the FTC. If a defendant
wants to appeal an FTC decision, it may bring an action in federal court. Both the Justice
Department and the FTC may take steps to halt objectionable behavior by firms. The
Justice Department may try to get an injunction, whereas the FTC may issue a cease
and desist order. Criminal actions are reserved for the Justice Department, which may
seek fines or even imprisonment for the violators as well as the costs of bringing the
action. Readers should not infer that government agencies are the sole parties who may
bring an antitrust action. Individuals and companies may also initiate such actions.
Indeed, it is ironic that such private actions constitute a significant percentage of the
total antitrust proceedings in the United States.63
REQUIRED DIVESTITURES AS PART OF THE
ANTITRUST APPROVAL PROCESS:
GLAXO-SMITHKLINE MERGER
Rather than prevent a merger, antitrust regulatory authorities may approve a deal
subject to the companies’ divesting of certain business units. One example of this
was the qualiﬁed permission that the FTC gave Glaxo Wellcome PLC in December
2000 to acquire SmithKline Beecham PLC. The permission was given only on the
condition that the companies would sell six businesses to rival drug companies.
Glaxo and SmithKline agreed to sell their antiemetic drug, Kytril, to F. Hoffman
LaRoche.a It also sold the U.S. marketing and distribution rights for an antibiotic
(ceftazidime) to Abbott Laboratories, while selling the world rights to certain antivi-
ral drugs to Novartis Pharma AG. In cases such as this, the companies have to
determine whether the costs of selling valued units and product rights to rivals,
which will make the rivals only more formidable competitors, are more than offset
by the gains from the merger. In this instance, Glaxo-SmithKline clearly decided
that the gains outweighed the costs. It is noteworthy that this is another cost of
the deal—one that may not necessarily be known at the time the parties enter into
an agreement. It is very much dependent on the actions of the antitrust regulatory
authorities, which, in turn, are only partially predictable.

A key factor that courts have relied on in deciding antitrust cases has been the mar-
ket share of the alleged violator of antitrust laws and the degree of concentration in
the industry. The Justice Department’s method of measuring market share and concen-
tration has varied over the years. The varying standards have been set forth in various
merger guidelines.
The 1968 Justice Department Merger Guidelines
In 1968, the Justice Department issued merger guidelines that set forth the types of
mergers that the government would oppose. They were largely unchanged until 1982.
Through these guidelines, which were used to help interpret the Sherman Act and the
Clayton Act, the Justice Department presented its definitions, in terms of specific mar-
ket share percentages, of highly concentrated and less highly concentrated industries.
These guidelines are based on the general concept that increased market concentration
will likely reduce competition.
The guidelines used concentration ratios, which are the market shares of the top
four or top eight firms in the industry. Under the 1968 guidelines, an industry was
considered to be highly concentrated if the four largest firms held at least 75% of the
total market. The 1968 guidelines set forth various share thresholds for acquiring and
acquired companies that would drive regulatory attentions. By today’s standards, these
share thresholds are small.
The 1982 Justice Department Guidelines
The limitations of such a rigid antitrust policy began to be felt in the 1970s; a policy
that allowed more flexibility was clearly needed. Such a policy was instituted in 1982
through the work of William Baxter, head of the antitrust division of the Justice
Department. Baxter was both a lawyer and an economist. Using his economics training,
he introduced certain quantitative measures into the antitrust enforcement process,
making it more mechanistic, predictable, and consistent with prevailing economic
theory. Chief among these measures was the Herfindahl-Hirschman (HH) index to
American antitrust policy.64 The HH index is the sum of the squares of the market
shares of each firm in the industry.
HH =
n
∑
i
s2
i
where si is the market share of the ith firm.
Using this index rather than simple market shares of the top four or top eight
firms in the industry provides a more precise measure of the impact of increased
concentration that would be brought on by a merger of two competitors. It is important
to note, however, that when using the HH index (or even concentration ratios), the

Legal Framework
assumption that each of the merged firms would maintain their market shares needs to
be carefully examined. The postmerger combined market share needs to be considered
even when this may be difficult.
Properties of the HH Index
The Herfindahl-Hirschman index possesses certain properties that make it a better mea-
sure of merger-related market concentration than simple concentration ratios:
◾
The index increases with the number of firms in the industry.
◾
The index sums the squares of the firms in the industry. In doing so, it weights larger
firms more heavily than smaller firms. Squaring a larger number will have a dispro-
portionately greater impact on the index than squaring a smaller number. More-
over, a merger that increases the size differences between firms will result in a larger
increase in the index than would have been reflected using simple concentration
ratios.
◾
Because larger firms have greater impact on the index, the index can provide useful
results even if there is incomplete information on the size of the smaller firms in the
industry.
In evaluating market concentration the following thresholds apply:
◾
Postmerger HH less than 1,000: Unconcentrated market. This is unlikely to cause an
antitrust challenge unless there are other anticompetitive effects.
◾
Postmerger HH between 1,000 and 1,800: Moderately concentrated market. If
a merger increases the HH index by less than 100 points, this is unlikely to
be a problem, but if it raises the index by more than 100 points, there may be
concentration-related antitrust concerns.
◾
Postmerger HH above 1,800: Highly concentrated market. If a merger raises the index
only by less than 50 points, this is unlikely to be objectionable. Increases of greater
than 50 points “raise significant antitrust concerns.”
EXAMPLE OF THE HH INDEX
Consider an industry composed of eight firms, each of which has a 12.5% market share.
The Herfindahl-Hirschman index, then, is equal to:
HH =
8
∑
i=1
si2 = 8(12.5)2 = 1,250
If two of these equal-sized firms merge, the index is computed to be:
HH = 625 + 937.5 = 1, 562.5

1984 Justice Department Guidelines
On June 14, 1984, the Justice Department again revised its merger guidelines in an
attempt to further refine its antitrust enforcement policies. The department recognized
that its prior guidelines, including the more accurate HH index, were too mechanistic
and inflexible. In an attempt to enhance the flexibility of its policies, the department
allowed the consideration of qualitative information in addition to the quantitative mea-
sures it had been employing. This qualitative information would include factors such as
the efficiency of firms in the industry, the financial viability of potential merger candi-
dates, and the ability of U.S. firms to compete in foreign markets.
The 1984 merger guidelines also introduced the 5% test. This test requires the Jus-
tice Department to make a judgment on the effects of a potential 5% increase in the price
ofeachproductofeachmergingfirm.Thistestisbasedontheassumptionthattheremay
be an increase in market power, resulting from the merger. If so, the merged firms may
have the ability to increase prices. The test attempts to examine the potential effects of
this increase on competitors and consumers.
One macroeconomic measure that provides an indication of the responsiveness of
consumers and competitors is the concept of elasticity. The price elasticity of demand
provides an indication of the consumers’ responsiveness to a change in the price of a
product. It is measured as follows:
◾
e > 1 Demand is elastic. The percentage change in quantity is more than the per-
centage change in price.
◾
e=1Unitaryelasticity.Thepercentagechangeinquantityisequaltothepercentage
change in price.
◾
e < 1 Inelastic demand. The percentage change in quality is less than the percentage
change in price.
If demand is inelastic over the 5% price change range, this implies greater mar-
ket power for the merged firms; if, however, demand is elastic, consumers are not as
adversely affected by the merger.
The 1982 and 1984 merger guidelines recognized the possibility of efficiency-
enhancing benefits from mergers. Although they do not have the force of law, the 1968
merger guidelines were found to warrant some legal consideration.
The 1992 Merger Guidelines
The current position of the Justice Department and the FTC is set forth in the jointly
issued 1992 merger guidelines, which were revised in 1997. They are similar to the
1984 guidelines in that they also recognize potential efficiency-enhancing benefits of
mergers. However, these guidelines indicate that a merger will be challenged if there are
anticompetitive effects, such as through price increases, even when there are demon-
strable efficiency benefits. Clearly, mergers that lead to an anticompetitive increase in
market powers will be challenged.

120
◾
Legal Framework
The 1992 guidelines provide a clarification of the definition of the relevant market,
which often is a crucial issue of an antitrust lawsuit. They state that a market is the
smallest group of products or geographic area where a monopoly could raise prices by a
certain amount, such as by 5%. Like the 1984 guidelines, they also use the HH index to
measure the competitive effects of a merger.
The 1992 guidelines set forth a five-step process that the enforcement authorities
follow:
1. Market definition and concentration: Assess whether the merger significantly
increases concentration. This involves a definition of the relevant market, which
may be an issue of dispute.
2. Competitive effects: Assess any potential anticompetitive effects of the deal.
3. Entry: Assess whether the potential anticompetitive effects could be mitigated by
entry into the market by competitors. The existence of barriers to entry needs to be
determined.
4. Efficiencies: Determine if there could be certain offsetting efficiency gains that may
result from the deal and that could offset the negative impact of the anticompetitive
effects.
5. Failing firm defense: Determine whether either party would fail or exit the market
but for the merger. These possible negative effects are then weighed against the
potential anticompetitive effects. The 1997 revisions highlight the antitrust
authorities’ willingness to consider the net antitrust effects of a merger. Adverse
anticompetitive effects may be offset by positive efficiency benefits. The merger
participants need to be able to demonstrate that the benefits are directly related
to the merger. It is recognized that such benefits may be difficult to quantify in
advance of the deal, but their demonstration may not be vague or speculative.
Practically, the merger-specific efficiencies offset only minor anticompetitive effects,
not major ones.
The 1997 revision of the 1992 guidelines emphasized how merger-specific efficien-
cies might allow companies to better compete and could possibly be translated into lower
prices for consumers. These efficiencies can be achieved only through the merger and
are measurable or cognizable.
One of the major contributions of the 2010 merger guidelines was that the
Justice Department made clear what was generally known by participants in this
marketplace—that the Justice Department did not really follow the mechanistic,
step-by-step process implied by the 1992 guidelines. Rather, it focused more broadly on
competitive effects and the analysis and research that would need to be done to make
these effects clear. Thus, these guidelines brought closer together actual practice with
the letter of the prior guidelines.
In 2011, the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department issued a Guide to Merger
Remedies, which emphasized that proposed remedies for mergers must ensure that

competition will be preserved and the deal participants must make sure that the
remedies have a beneficial impact on consumers and not market participants.
EUROPEAN COMPETITION POLICY
In December 1989, the European Union adopted what is referred to as the merger
regulation. This policy went into effect in September 1990 but was later amended.
The regulation focused on mergers, but also joint ventures, that have an impact on
the degree of competition beyond one nation’s borders. Under the regulation, mergers
with significant revenues must receive European Commission (EC) approval. Unlike the
U.S. system, in which antitrust regulators must go to court to block a merger, the EC’s
regulatory system is not dependent on the courts.
In its revised 2004 merger regulations, the EC established its M&A policy as follows:
A concentration that would sufficiently impede competition, in the common market or a
substantial part of it, in particular as a result of the creation, or strengthening of a domi-
nant position, shall be declared incomparable with the Common Market.
The later EC M&A regulations are broader than the prior version in that while they
mention market dominance, this is now merely an example of an anticompetitive condi-
tion.65 As part of its analysis the EC first defines the market and then looks to determine
the market power before and after the deals. As part of this determination, factors such
as barriers to entry are taken into account. Once this analysis is done, the EC does a
further analysis of the competitive effects of the deal.
The EC utilizes its own horizontal merger guidelines, which start off with postdeal
market shares greater than 50% giving rise to concerns while shares below 25% to 30%
tend not to raise such concerns. The EC is also less likely to raise concerns when HH
indexes are below 1,000, or when they are below 2,000 but the postdeal delta is low
(such as between 150 and 250).
Transactions that the EC finds particularly objectionable may be brought to the
European Court of Justice.
U.S. companies that do significant business in Europe must secure European Union
approval in addition to the approval by U.S. antitrust authorities. Sometimes this can
be a time-consuming process. For example, the European Union pursued a six-month
investigation into Oracle Corporation’s $7.4 billion takeover of Sun Microsystems Inc.
prior to approving the deal in January 2010.
Although the instances in which the U.S. antitrust authorities and their European
counterparts disagree on the competitive effects of M&As receive much attention, most
of the time they agree on the effects.66 One prominent example where they disagreed

was the proposed $40 billion General Electric–Honeywell merger. The European
opposition to the GE–Honeywell deal, a merger that was not opposed in the United
States, raised many eyebrows as some felt the European Union was using its competition
policy to insulate European companies from competition with larger U.S. rivals. Others
concluded that the decision was the product of an inadequate analysis on the part of the
EC.67 This conflict led to a round of discussions to make the competition policies in both
markets more consistent. Under the leadership of then–antitrust chief Mario Monti, a
former Italian economics professor, the EC antitrust regulators, based in Brussels, used
an economic doctrine known as collective dominance when reviewing the impact that
mergers may have on the level of competition within the EU. This refers to the ability
of a group of companies to dominate a particular market. In the EU market shares
below 40% could draw an enforcement action, whereas much higher thresholds, such
as 60%, may apply in the United States.
While European regulators have framed their opposition to certain M&As as a way
oflimitedmonopolypowerandhelpingconsumerwelfare,othersaremorecynicalabout
their motives. Aktas, de Bodt, and Roll analyzed a sample of 290 proposed acquisitions
that were examined by the European regulators during the 1990s.68 They found the
greater the adverse impact on European rivals resulting from deals by foreign compa-
nies, the more likely that regulators would move to oppose the M&A.
EU Merger Control Procedures
The European Commission sets certain deal sizes, or turnover thresholds, above which the
European Union will review a deal. Size is defined in terms of both worldwide and EU
business volume. The EC requires that it be notified before a merger is completed. It
has preprepared templates that merger partners complete. Many deals do not get much
EC scrutiny, but if the deal results in 15% combined horizontal market shares or 25%
in vertical markets, the EC does an investigation. The investigation process starts with
Phase I, which is usually completed in 25 business days. Ninety percent of all cases are
cleared in Phase I. The remaining 10% have attracted competition concerns, and these
are addressed in Phase II.
In Phase II, the deal participants are expected to put forward or agree to remedies
that will guarantee continued competition. Phase II is usually completed in 90 business
days, although the EC can add another 15 days to this time limit. If the EC agrees to the
remedies, then it appoints a trustee who will oversee the implementation of the remedies

Research Note: Event Studies
Methodology
T
hroughout the rest of this book we will refer to various empirical research studies.
Many of these studies utilize a research methodology called event studies. It is,
therefore, useful to briefly discuss how these studies are conducted.
M&A RESEARCH: EVENT STUDIES
Event studies are used in empirical financial research to measure the impact of a specific
event on the market value of a company.1 However, researchers in other fields, such
as accounting, management, and forensic economics, have also increased their use of
event studies.2
The more efficient the market, the more quickly a relevant event may cause a change
in the market value of the firm. The more rational the market, the more accurate the
response will be.
As event studies relate to M&As, such studies seek to measure the impact of an
M&A-related event, such as the announcement of a takeover bid, or the implementa-
tion of a specific takeover defense, on the value of one of the companies involved. This is
done through measuring cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). These returns are deter-
mined through measuring the difference between the expected value produced by the
capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the observed actual return.
Specifically, the differences referred to above are called abnormal returns. They are
those returns that cannot be fully explained by market movements. The returns that
can be explained by market movements are those that are generated by CAPM. These
returns are defined using the “market model” shown in equation 1:
Rit = αii + βmtRmit + ́εit

where:
Rit
is the cumulative dividend monthly stock return for the ith firm in month t;
Rmit is the return on a market portfolio month t relative to the announcement
of offer;
∞,
β are the regression parameters; and
εit
is a stochastic error term with a mean of zero.
Abnormal returns for firm i and month t are defined as follows:
ARit = Rit −αii + βmtRmit
(2)
These abnormal returns can then be summed for a defined time period to arrive at
cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). CARs are used as a guide to abnormal effects in a
wide variety of M&A event studies.
In order to conduct an event study, a researcher must gather data on the returns
of the company being studied and the reference index. A common reference index is
the S&P 500, which is an often-used measure of the performance of the overall market.
It actually is not a measure of the overall market. Rather, it is an index that reflects
the performance of 500 stocks selected by Standard & Poors. However, this often-used
market measure is very closely correlated to other often-cited market indices such as the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, which actually only includes just 30 large capitalization
companies.
Standard econometric tests are used to verify the statistical significance of the
estimated parameters such as α and β. For example, t statistics are used to test whether
the beta coefficient, β, is statistically significant. A value in excess of a certain signifi-
cance threshold, often 2 (actually 1.96), may lead the researcher to conclude that there
is a statistically significant relationship between the changes in the value of the returns
on the market and the returns on the security in question.3
Researchers must be mindful of the time periods they are using for their historical
data, which is used to estimate their model. First, different time periods selected may
result in different values for the estimated parameters. Moreover, if the prior time period
featured unusual volatility, such as the subprime crisis of 2008, returns could seem
“abnormal,” but this abnormality could really have been a function of the unusual eco-
nomic conditions and not a product of the event being studied.
One of the first steps in the process of conducting an event study is to define the
event window. This is the time period over which the events had their main effect. The
longer the time period, the more likely that confounding events may have influenced any
perceived changes in CARs. Thus researchers try to keep the event window relatively
short while also making sure it is long enough to capture the full effect of the event in
question.
3 Returns, as opposed to “levels,” are used because levels may be inflicted with a statistical condition known as
nonstationarity. Nonstationarity makes the traditional diagnostic statistics generated by regression analysis
programs, such as t statistics and R2, less meaningful—if not useless. Converting to returns allows for more
standard interpretation of such diagnostic measures.

Event analysis period.
Another basic step in the research process is to define the frequency of the data. It is
common in M&A research for studies to utilize daily returns. However, different types of
studies could use monthly or even minute-by-minute data. It all depends on the type
of event study being done.
Other models can be used with more explanatory variables, which, conceivably,
could enhance the explanatory power of the model by taking into account other fac-
tors beyond just the overall market, such as the industries involved. However, generally,
the more variables involved, the greater the data needs.
The models that are used to measure the effects of an event are estimated—that is,
their parameters, are estimated—using historical data derived from a specific sample
period (see Figure 1). For M&A-oriented event studies, the basic market model is used
to filter out the influence of the market so that the impact of an event, such as the
announcement of a merger, can be measured. Regression analysis is used to estimate
the parameters, which, in turn, are used to show the expected returns, and these
are then compared to the actual returns that occurred during the event window. For
example, if an acquirer’s returns decline by more than can be explained by market
movements following an announcement of a proposed acquisition, researchers may
conclude that this is due to the market disapproving of the deal. Similarly, if a target’s
return rises by more than what the market model predicts, the researcher may attribute
this to the market anticipating that shareholders will receive a premium if the deal
eventually closes and also that the deal could be value enhancing.
Like much of statistical analysis, event studies can be affected by outliers. Various
methods may be used to deal with the presence of outliers, including eliminating those
observations, although most researchers try to avoid such a “solution.” Outliers can be
more of an issue with small samples.4

CHAPTER FOUR
Merger Strategy
T
HIS CHAPTER FOCUSES ON the strategic motives and determinants of mergers
and acquisitions (M&As). It begins with a discussion of two of the most often cited
motives for M&As—faster growth and synergy. Also discussed are the relative
benefits of horizontal, vertical, and diversifying mergers, as well as other motives, such
as the pursuit of economies of scale.
GROWTH
One of the most fundamental motives for M&As is growth. Companies seeking to expand
are faced with a choice between internal or organic growth and growth through M&As.
Internal growth may be a slow and uncertain process. Growth through M&As may
be much more rapid, although it brings with it its own uncertainties. Companies may
grow within their own industry or they may expand outside their business category.
Expansion outside one’s industry means diversification. Because diversification has
been a controversial topic in finance, it is discussed separately later in this chapter. In
this section we focus on growth within a company’s own industry.
If a company seeks to expand within its own industry, it may conclude that
internal growth is not an acceptable means. For example, if a company has a window
of opportunity that will remain open for only a limited period of time, slow internal
growth may not suffice. As the company grows slowly through internal expansion,
competitors may respond quickly and take market share. Advantages that a company
may have can dissipate over time or be whittled away by the actions of competitors.
The only solution may be to acquire another company that has established offices and

facilities, management, and other resources, in place. There are many opportunities
that must be acted on immediately lest they disappear. It could be that a company has
developed a new product or process and has a time advantage over competitors. Even
if it is possible to patent the product or process, this does not prevent competitors from
possibly developing a competing product or process that does not violate the patent.
Another example would be if a company developed a new merchandising concept.
Being first to develop the concept provides a certain limited time advantage. If not
properly taken advantage of, it may slip by and become an opportunity for larger
competitors with greater resources.

This strategy is similar to that pursued by companies in other rapidly changing,
innovation-ﬁlled industries, such as the computer software industry. Rather than
internally trying to be on the forefront of every major area of innovation, Johnson
& Johnson, a company that generated $72 billion in revenues in 2016, has sought
to pursue those companies that have developed successful products. In doing so,
it sought not to waste time with unsuccessful internal development attempts and
went after only those products and companies that have demonstrated success.
However, the company has to pay a premium for such deals. This strategy has
sometimes simply meant that Johnson & Johnson would buy its competitors rather
than try to surpass them using internal growth. For example, in 1996 it acquired
Cordis in the medical stent business for $1.8 billion. When this deal failed to place
it in the lead in this market segment, Johnson & Johnson resorted to M&A again
with its $25.4 billion (initial) bid for market leader Guidant. This acquisition would
have been the largest deal in Johnson & Johnson’s long history of M&A. However,
it lowered its bid when Guidant’s litigation liabilities became known, and then was
outbid by Boston Scientiﬁc. In 2006, following the collapse of the Guidant deal,
the cash-rich Johnson & Johnson acquired Pﬁzer’s consumer products division for
$16 billion.
The acquisition of Pﬁzer’s consumer products business expanded J&J’s pres-
ence in the consumer products segment. J&J’s consumer revenues rose from $9
billion prior to the acquisition to $15.8 billion by 2009. However, revenues in this
segment declined to $13.3 billion by the end of 2016 (Figure A). At the same time,
sales of drugs grew while revenues on medical devices weakened. Pretax proﬁt
margins on drugs rose from 28.5% in 2009 to 38.3% in 2016, while margins on med-
ical devices declined from 32.6% in 2009 to 22.2% in 2016. The pretax margins on
consumer products increased from 15.7% in 2009 to 18.3% in 2016. The acquisi-
tion of Pﬁzer’s consumer products business gave J&J signiﬁcant “top-line” growth
but helped to lower overall corporate margins as consumer products have lower
margins (Figure B).

For Pﬁzer, the sale helped raise margins. In addition, Pﬁzer was able to offset
the overall loss of revenues by acquiring Wyeth, thereby expanding its presence in
the higher-margin pharmaceuticals. This acquisition was necessary, as Pﬁzer had to
try to offset the loss of revenues from patent expiration on drugs such as Lipitor, the
largest selling drug in the world at that time with annual revenues of approximately
$11 billion. In the years that followed, Pﬁzer worked to become a more focused
company. In 2012, it sold its baby food business to Nestlé. In 2013, it left the animal
health business with the spinoff of Zoetis.
In 2017, J&J acquired Actelion, Ltd. for $30 billion in cash. This move
was designed to enhance J&J’s proﬁtability through developing higher-margin
drugs—especially those that focus on rare diseases, which may command high
prices.
Another example of using M&As to facilitate growth is when a company wants to
expand to another geographic region. It could be that the company’s market is in one
part of the country, but it wants to expand into other regions. Alternatively, perhaps it is
already a national company but seeks to tap the markets of other nations, such as a U.S.
firm wanting to expand into Europe. In many instances, it may be quicker and less risky
to expand geographically through acquisitions than through internal development.
This may be particularly true of international expansion, where many characteristics

are needed to be successful in a new geographic market. The company needs to know
all of the nuances of the new market, recruit new personnel, and circumvent many
other hurdles, such as language and custom barriers. Internal expansion may be much
slower and more difficult. Mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances
may be the fastest and lowest-risk alternatives.
Achieving Growth in a Slow-Growth Industry through Acquisitions
Corporate managers are under constant pressure to demonstrate successful growth.
This is particularly true when the company and the industry have achieved growth in
the past. However, when the demand for an industry’s products and services slows, it
becomes more difficult to continue to grow. When this happens, managers often look to
M&A as a way to jump start growth. It often is hoped that acquisitions will lead not only
to revenue growth but also to improved profitability through synergistic gains. Unfor-
tunately, it is much easier to generate sales growth by simply adding the revenues of
acquisition targets than it is to improve the profitability of the overall enterprise. In fact,
one can argue that although acquisitions bring with them the possibility of synergis-
tic gains, they also impose greater demands on management, which now runs an even
larger enterprise. Management needs to make sure that the greater size in terms of rev-
enues has brought with it commensurate profits and returns for shareholders. If not,
then the growth through M&A strategy has not improved shareholders’ positions and
investors would have been better off if management had resigned themselves to being a
slower-growth company.
FLAVOR AND FRAGRANCE INDUSTRY: USING
ACQUISITIONS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH IN A
SLOW-GROWTH INDUSTRY (IFF’S ACQUISITION
OF BUSH BOAKE ALLEN)
T
he growth in the ﬂavor and fragrance industry slowed signiﬁcantly in the 1990s.
Companies in this industry sold products to manufacturers and marketers of
various other products. As the demand for the end users’ products slowed, the
demand for intermediate products, such as ﬂavors, also slowed. Food manufacturers
rely on various suppliers, including ﬂavor developers, to come up with new or
improved products. The frozen food business is a case in point.
With the advent of the microwave oven, this business grew dramatically. How-
ever, when the proliferation of this innovation reached its peak, the growth in the
frozen food business also slowed. Companies that sold to frozen food manufacturers
experienced the impact of this slowing demand in the form of a slower demand for
their products and increased pressure placed on them by manufacturers for price
concessions that would enable the manufacturers to improve their own margins.
Faced with the prospect of slow growth, International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF),

one of the largest companies in this industry, acquired competitor Bush Boake Allen,
which was about one-third the size of IFF. On the surface, however, the acquisition
of Bush Boake Allen increased the size of IFF by one-third, giving at least the
appearance of signiﬁcant growth in this slow-growth industry.
Is Growth or Increased Return the More Appropriate Goal?
It is virtually assumed without question that a major goal for a company’s management
and board is to achieve growth. However, managers need to make sure that the growth
is one that will generate good returns for shareholders. Too often, management may be
able to continue to generate acceptable returns by keeping a company at a given size,
but instead choose to pursue aggressive growth.1 Boards need to critically examine
the expected profitability of the revenue derived from growth and determine if the
growth is worth the cost. Consider the case of Hewlett-Packard in the post-Fiorina era.
Having made a highly questionable $19 billion mega-acquisition of Compaq in 2002
(Compaq itself had acquired Tandem Computers in 1997 and Digital Equipment in
1998), Hewlett-Packard found itself managing several business segments in which it
was a leader in only one—printers. In 2009, the company had revenues in excess of
$114 billion. If, as an example, its goal was to grow at 10% per year, it would have to
generate approximately $11 billion in new revenues each year. In effect, it would have
to create another large company’s worth of revenues each year to satisfy management’s
growth goals. When we consider the fact that much of its business comes from the
highly competitive personal computer market with its weak margins coupled with
steady product price deflation, such growth can be a challenge.
In the years after Fiorina’s departure the company continued with its pattern of
failed acquisitions. In 2008, with Mark Hurd at the helm, HP acquired EDS, which
was followed by a write-down of $8 billion. In 2011, with Leo Apotheker as CEO, HP
acquired Autonomy for $10 billion, which was followed by an acquisition-related
charge of $8.8 billion. While it may not have as long a track record of M&A failures
as AT&T, for a number of years HP seemed to be working hard to catch AT&T for the
position of “world leader” in M&A failures.2 Undaunted, however, in 2013 HP acquired
data storage giant EMC.
The market got fed up with the ever-growing HP and decided it had enough.
In 2014, in response to the market’s disapproval, HP split itself in two. The PC and
printer business was separated with the name HP, Inc. from the services and data
unit, called HP Enterprise. The PC and printer business is highly competitive, and
HP had been struggling to not lose too much ground. However, even the Enterprise
unit had been experiencing declining revenues, yet HP believes that it has more growth
potential.

International Growth and Cross-Border Acquisitions
Companies that have successful products in one national market may see cross-border
acquisitions as a way of achieving greater revenues and profits. Rather than seek
potentially diminishing returns by pursuing further growth within their own nation,
companies may use cross-border deals as an advantageous way of tapping another
market. A cross-border deal may enable an acquirer to utilize the country-specific
know-how of the target, including its indigenous staff and distribution network.
The key question, as it is with every acquisition, is whether the risk-adjusted return
from the deal is greater than what can be achieved with the next best use of the
invested capital.
WiththeadventoftheEuropeanCommonMarket,cross-countrybarriershavebeen
reduced. This has given rise to a spate of cross-border deals in Europe. Certain Asian
marketscontinuetoberesistanttoforeignacquirers(althoughtherearesignsthatthisis
changing); thus, the volume of cross-border deals in this region is probably significantly
less than what it will be in the future, if and when these artificial market restrictions
become more relaxed.
Cross-border deals present some basic and obvious challenges that domestic deals
lack. A business model that may work well in a home country can fail for unexpected
reasons in another nation. One example of this was Target’s failed expansion into
Canada. The giant retailer believed the fact that Canadian visitors to the United States
liked to shop at Target was a signal that expansion into neighboring Canada would
be fruitful. This proved not to be the case. In 2015, Target decided to close its 133
Canadian stores just two years after this failed expansion strategy.
Language differences can also pose a challenge not just in the initial negotiations
but also in post-deal integration.3 In addition, even though new geographic markets
may present opportunities for revenue and profit growth, physical distances can also
increase managerial demands.
As with all types of acquisitions, we need to consider the market reactions to inter-
national M&As and compare them to intracountry deals. Doukas and Travlos found
that, unlike many domestic acquisitions, acquirers enjoyed positive (although not sta-
tistically significant) returns when they acquired targets in countries in which they did
not previously have operations. Interestingly, the returns were negative (although also
not statistically significant) when the acquirers already had operations in these foreign
countries.4 When the company is already in the market, and presumably has already
exploited some of the gains that can be realized, then investors may be less sanguine
about the gains that may be realized through an increased presence in this same region.
Another study compared the shareholder wealth effects of acquisitions of U.S.
firms by non-U.S. bidders and the opposite—acquisitions of non-U.S. companies by
U.S. bidders. Cakici, Hessel, and Tandon analyzed the shareholder wealth effects from
195 acquisitions, over the period 1983–1992, of non-U.S. companies that bought

U.S. targets.5 They then compared these effects to a sample of 112 deals in which U.S.
companies acquired non-U.S. firms. The non-U.S. acquirers generated statistically
significant returns of just under 2% over a 10-day window, whereas the U.S. acquirers
realized the negative returns that we often generally see from acquisitions.
Still another research study by Markides and Oyon, using a sample of 236 deals,
compared acquisitions by U.S. firms of European (189) versus Canadian targets (47).
They found positive announcement effects for acquisitions of continental European tar-
gets but not for acquisitions of British or Canadian target firms.6 These negative share-
holder wealth effects for acquisitions of Canadian firms were also found by Eckbo and
Thorburn, who considered 390 deals involving Canadian companies over the period
1962–1983.7
The fact that acquisitions of non-U.S. targets by U.S. companies may be riskier than
deals involving all-U.S. targets is underscored by a large sample study by Moeller and
Schlingemann.8 They analyzed 4,430 deals over the period 1985–1992. They found
that U.S. bidders who pursued cross-border deals realized lower returns than acquisi-
tions where the bidders chose U.S. targets.
Currency-Related Effects
Exchange rates can play an important role in international takeovers. When the
currency of a bidder appreciates relative to that of a target, a buyer holding the more
highly valued currency may be able to afford a higher premium, which the target may
have difficulty passing up. In analyzing a large sample of 56,978 cross-border M&As
covering the period 1990–2007, Erel, Liao, and Weisbach confirmed the important
role that exchange rates play in M&As.9 In their sample, they found that countries
whose currencies appreciated were more likely to have acquirers and countries whose
currency depreciated were more likely to have targets. Lin, Officer, and Shen analyzed
a sample of 12,131 cross-border M&As over the period 1996–2012 and found that
not only do acquirers from countries with appreciating currencies realize higher
announcement period returns than those not affected by such currency changes, but
also that this positive effect, which was present at the time of the announcement and
also in the post-merger period, was greater the better the corporate governance of the
acquirer.10

INTERNATIONAL GROWTH AND THE HOTEL
INDUSTRY
I
n January 2006, the Hilton Hotels Corp. announced a $5.7 billion offer to purchase
the international hotel business unit owned by Hilton Group PLC. This acquisition
offer came with a touch of irony as the two businesses were one prior to 1964,
when Hilton parted ways with its international hotel business. The move to expand
outside the United States came partly in response to the international expansion
efforts of two of Hilton’s main rivals—Marriott International Inc. and Starwood Hotels
and Resorts Worldwide Inc.
The combination united the hotels operating under the Hilton name and allows
Hilton to offer an international network of properties across the globe. The chain
traces its roots to Conrad Hilton in 1919, when he bought his ﬁrst hotel. The
company was split in 1964 and as part of that division the two units agreed not
to compete with one another. However, market opportunities in the 1960s were
very different from those of the 2000s. The current world market is much more
globalized. Hotel businesses that can offer a true global network can leverage their
customer base in one market to generate sales in another. For example, some
American travelers familiar with the Hilton brand and seeking comparable services
when abroad might more likely stay at a Hilton property than another that they were
unfamiliar with.
In 2007, Hilton Hotels was acquired by the Blackstone private equity ﬁrm
in a $26 billion LBO. The price was expensive, and it reﬂected a purchase
at the top of the market. When the global economy turned down and the
United States entered the Great Recession, the pricey Hilton acquisition looked
questionable. However, after a shaky initial period where Blackstone had to
infuse more equity capital into the hotel chain, the business increased its
efﬁciency while also expanding its revenue base. It added over 200,000 new
rooms to increase its total rooms to 700,000.a Over the period 2009–2016,
Hilton’s operating proﬁts increased signiﬁcantly (Figure A). We can see that,

but for 2016, the company enjoyed an exponential rise in operating proﬁts. The
increase in operating proﬁts provided multiple exit opportunities for Blackstone.
In 2014, in two separate offerings, Blackstone raised $2.33 billion and $2.59 billion
through sales of equity. In 2016, the ﬁrm reduced its ownership to 21% through
selling a 25% interest to the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group for $6.5 billion.

SYNERGY
The term synergy is often associated with the physical sciences rather than with eco-
nomics or finance. It refers to the type of reaction that occurs when two substances or
factors combine to produce a greater effect together than that which the sum of the two
operating independently could account for. For example, a synergistic reaction occurs
in chemistry when two chemicals combine to produce a more potent total reaction than
the sum of their separate effects. Simply stated, synergy refers to the phenomenon of 2 +
2 = 5. In mergers, this translates into the ability of a corporate combination to be more
profitable than the individual parts of the firms that were combined.
The anticipated existence of synergistic benefits allows firms to incur the expenses
of the acquisition process and still be able to afford companies to give target shareholders
a premium for their shares. Synergy may allow the combined firm to appear to have a
positive net acquisition value (NAV).
NAV = VAB −[VA + VB] −P −E
(4.1)
where:
VAB = the combined value of the two firms,
VA
= the value of A,
VB
= the value of B,
P
= the premium paid for B, and
E
= the expenses of the acquisition process.
Reorganizing equation 4.1, we get:
NAV = [VAB −(VA + VB)] −(P + E)
(4.2)
The term in the brackets is the synergistic effect. This effect must be greater than the
sum of P + E to justify going forward with the merger. If the bracketed term is not greater
than the sum of P + E, the bidding firm will have overpaid for the target. What are to be

considered synergistic effects? Some researchers view synergy broadly and include the
elimination of inefficient management by installing the more capable management of
the acquiring firm.11 Although it is reasonable to define synergy in this manner, this
chapter defines the term more narrowly and treats management-induced gains sepa-
rately. This approach is consistent with the more common uses of the term synergy.12
The two main types of synergy are operating synergy forms: revenue enhance-
ments and cost reductions. These revenue enhancements and efficiency gains or
operating economies may be derived in horizontal or vertical mergers. Financial synergy
refers to the possibility that the cost of capital may be lowered by combining one or
more companies.
ALLEGIS: SYNERGY THAT NEVER MATERIALIZED
T
he case of the Allegis Corporation is a classic example of synergistic beneﬁts
that had every reason to occur but failed to materialize. The concept of Allegis
was the brainchild of CEO Richard Ferris, who rose through the ranks of United
Airlines.
Ferris’s dream was to form a diversiﬁed travel services company that would be
able to provide customers with a complete package of air travel, hotel, and car
rental services. Accordingly, United Airlines paid $587 million for Hertz Rent A Car
to RCA in June 1986—a price that was considered a premium. In addition to buying
Pan American Airways’ Paciﬁc routes, Ferris bought the Hilton International hotel
chain from the Transworld Corporation for $980 million. The Hilton International
purchase on March 31, 1987, was also considered expensive.
United Airlines had already acquired the Westin International hotel chain in
1970 for only $52 million. On February 18, 1987, United Airlines changed its name
to Allegis Corporation. Allegis’s strategy was to offer customers “one-stop” travel
shopping. With one telephone call they could book their air travel, hotel reserva-
tions, and car rental within the same corporate umbrella. Allegis hoped to weave
the network together through a combination of cross-discounts, bonus miles, and
other promotional savings and the introduction of a new computer system called
Easy Saver. Through Easy Saver, customers could check prices and book reserva-
tions through the Allegis network. All travel services could be charged on an Allegis
credit card. Travel agents using United Airlines’ Apollo computer reservation system,
the largest in the airline industry, would pull up Allegis’s air, hotel, and car services
before any other competitor’s products.
Despite the concept’s appeal to United’s management, customers and the
market failed to respond. At a time when the stock market was providing hand-
some returns to investors, the Allegis stock price fell; in February 1987, its stock
price was in the low- to mid-$50 range. The market did respond, however, when

(continued )
Coniston Partners, a New York investment ﬁrm, accumulated a 13% stake in the
travel company. Coniston planned to sell off the various parts of the Allegis travel
network and distribute the proceeds to the stockholders. On April 1, 1987, Allegis
announced a large recapitalization plan proposal that would have resulted in the
company’s assuming $3 billion worth of additional debt to ﬁnance a $60 special
dividend. The recapitalization plan was intended to support the stock price while
instilling stockholder support for Allegis and away from the Coniston proposal. The
United Airlines Pilots Union followed up Allegis’s recapitalization plan proposal with
its own offer to buy the airline and sell off the nonairline parts.
The pressure on CEO Ferris continued to mount, leading to a pivotal board of
directors meeting. According to Chairman of the Board Charles Luce, the board,
watching the company’s stock, “thought the market was saying that Allegis was
worth more broken up and that the current strategy should be abandoned.”
Although the outside directors had supported Ferris during the company’s acqui-
sition program, they now decided that Ferris was an obstacle to restructuring the
company. “There comes a point,” said Luce, “when no board can impose its own
beliefs over the opposition of the people who elected it.” Ferris was replaced by
Frank A. Olsen, chairman of Allegis’s Hertz subsidiary.a
Allegis is one of many examples of management wanting to create a “one-stop
shop” for consumers that the market failed to embrace. Sears’s diversifying acquisi-
tions and Citicorp’s related acquisitions are other examples of such failures. Boards
that should know better seem to be too passive and allow managers to waste
resources on these failed empire-building efforts.

OPERATING SYNERGY
Operating synergy cancomefromgainsthat enhancerevenuesorthosethat lowercosts.
Of the two, revenue enhancements can be the more difficult to achieve. Such gains are
easier for deal proponents to talk about than to achieve.
Revenue-Enhancing Operating Synergy
As we have noted, revenue-enhancing synergies can be difficult to achieve. One survey
by McKinsey estimated that 70% of mergers failed to achieve their expected revenue
synergies.13
Revenue-enhancing synergies can come from various sources:
◾
Pricing power
◾
Combination of functional strengths
◾
Growth from faster-growth markets or new markets
A combination of two companies may lead to greater pricing power or purchasing
power. This will normally be possible only if the two companies are in the same business.

Quarterly 2 (2004): 92–99.

Operating Synergy

139
Whetherthiswillbeachievabledependsonthedegreeofcompetitionintheindustryand
relevant geographic markets, as well as the size of the merger partners. With respect to
pricing power, if the combination leads to a more oligopolistic market structure, this may
be possible. On the other hand, if large pricing gains are achievable through increased
concentration, the deal may not get regulatory approval.
Research on the source of gains from horizontal mergers has found that gains asso-
ciated with such deals can be attributed to efficiency improvements, not increased mar-
ket power.14 These studies examined the stock market response reactions, or lack of a
response, by competitors, customers, and suppliers.
Another potential source of merger revenue enhancement can be the combination
of functional strengths. Perhaps one company has strong R&D or production abilities
while the other has great marketing and distribution. Each merger partner could be
bringing important capabilities to the table—ones that the other lacks. Many good
examples of this have occurred in the pharmaceutical industry through combinations
between drug companies with good R&D, something the industry has been struggling
to improve, and large pharmaceutical companies with great manufacturing capacity
and quality control (very important in this industry) but also global marketing and
distribution capabilities.
In mature markets, Japan, and Europe, corporate growth slowed for a number of
years and companies have to work harder and harder to achieve meaningful growth.
This sometimes means that large companies have to invest greater amounts to increase
market share or sometimes to merely maintain what they have. However, such com-
panies may be able to achieve important increases in growth by moving into more
rapidly growing markets, such as those in the emerging world. When many companies
are struggling to expand their mature markets and reaching rapidly diminishing
returns, the fastest way to realize meaningful growth can be to enter higher-growth
new markets.
Revenue-Related “Dissynergies”
Not only may M&A-related increases in revenues be difficult to achieve, but also
M&A-related losses in revenues may be difficult to prevent. Customers of the target may
not want to stay with the larger company. However, when the bidder paid a premium
for the target, the profitability of its total revenues was likely used to compute the
total price. If revenues are lost, this can make the deal a loser. This is why simplistic
projections of deal gains must be carefully examined.
Cost-Reducing Operating Synergies
Merger planners tend to look for cost-reducing synergies as the main source of operating
synergies. These cost reductions may come as a result of economies of scale—decreases
in per-unit costs that result from an increase in the size or scale of a company’s
operations.

Merger Strategy
Manufacturing firms, especially capital-intensive ones, typically operate at high
per-unit costs for low levels of output. This is because the fixed costs of operating their
manufacturing facilities are spread out over relatively low levels of output. As the
output levels rise, the per-unit costs decline. This is sometimes referred to as spreading
overhead. Some of the other sources of these gains arise from increased specialization of
labor and management and the more efficient use of capital equipment, which might
not be possible at low output levels. This phenomenon continues for a certain range
of output, after which per-unit costs may rise as the firm experiences diseconomies of
scale. Diseconomies of scale may arise as the firm experiences higher costs and other
problems associated with coordinating a larger-scale operation. The extent to which
diseconomies of scale exist is a topic of dispute for many economists. Some economists
cite as evidence the continued growth of large multinational companies, such as Exxon
and General Electric. These firms have exhibited extended periods of growth while still
paying stockholders an acceptable return on equity.15 Others contend that such firms
would be able to provide stockholders a higher rate of return if they were smaller, more
efficient companies.
CONSOLIDATION IN THE CRUISE INDUSTRY AND
THE PURSUIT OF ECONOMIES AND OTHER
SYNERGIES
S
everal examples of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) motivated by the pursuit
of scale economies have occurred in the cruise industry, which has undergone
a series of consolidating M&As. Examples include the 1989 acquisition of Sitmar
Cruises by Princess Cruises and the 1994 merger between Radisson Diamond
Cruises and Seven Seas Cruises, which enabled the combined cruise lines to offer
an expanded product line in the form of more ships, beds, and itineraries while
lowering per-bed costs. The cruise industry has learned that a sales force of a given
size can service a greater number of ships and itineraries. As cruise lines combine,
they ﬁnd that they do not need to maintain the same size of administrative facilities
and sales forces. For example, each cruise line has its own network of district sales
managers who call on travel agencies within an area. When one cruise line buys
another, one company’s sales force may be able to service the combined itineraries
of both groups of ships. This enables the acquiring company to purchase the target’s
projected revenues with less than the target’s historical cost structure.
Another example of scale economies related to these cruise mergers is the
use of marketing expenditures. Partly because of the size of their ﬂeets, the large
U.S. cruise lines such as Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and NCL can conduct national
television advertising campaigns. Such campaigns are cost-prohibitive for smaller
cruise lines.
Carnival was particularly effective at using M&As to create a full-service cruise
line. Originally a low-priced, mass-market cruise line, it has become the largest

financial services when the subprime crisis took hold in 2007–2008.

company in the industry through a broad acquisition program. Its acquisitions
include Princess Cruises, Holland American, Seaborne, and Costa Cruises. These
acquisitions constitute the full range of price points in the industry. Carnival is
a lower-priced, mass-market product, while Seaborne is at the opposite end of
the price spectrum and offers ﬁve-star cruising. Businesses often ﬁnd it challeng-
ing to be everything to all consumers, but Carnival does it well by keeping each
cruise line within the overall company a separate and distinct cruise experience for
customers.
There is empirical support spanning a long time period for the assertion that
M&As are successful in achieving operating economies. For example, Lichtenberg and
Siegel detected improvements in the efficiency of plants that had undergone ownership
changes.16 In fact, they found that those plants that had performed the worst were the
ones that were most likely to experience an ownership change. There is also more recent
research that supports these findings. Shahrur examined the returns that occurred
around the announcement of 463 horizontal mergers and tender offers over the period
1987–1999. He noticed positive combined bidder/target returns and interpreted these
findings to imply that the market saw the deals as efficiency-enhancing.17 These results
are also consistent with the stock market reactions (positive return of 3.06% over a
three-day window) detected in Fee and Thomas’s analysis of a large sample of 554
horizontal deals over the period 1980–1997.18
It should not, however, be concluded that simply because some evidence exists that
mergers are associated with operating economies, mergers are the best way to achieve
such economies. That proposition is not supported by economic research.
Another concept that is closely related to and sometimes confused with economies
of scale is economies of scope, which is the ability of a firm to utilize one set of inputs to pro-
vide a broader range of products and services. A good example of scope economies arises
in the banking industry. In the banking industry, scope economies may be as important
as economies of scale in explaining M&As.19 The pursuit of these economies is one of the
factors behind the consolidation within the banking industry that occurred in the fifth
merger wave.
Cost Improvements through Gains in Purchasing Power
If a combination of two companies yields enhanced purchasing power, this can lead to
meaningful reductions in costs. Examples of this can be seen in InBev’s acquisition of

Anheuser Busch and, to some extent, Mittal’s consolidation of steel producers. One ben-
efit of purchasing power enhancement is that it may be less likely to draw the attention
of regulators than combinations that will have more apparent effects on consumers.
To test whether horizontal combinations can result in purchasing power improve-
ments, Bhattacharyya and Nain analyzed a large sample of deals over the period
1984–2003. They sought to test the impact of horizontal mergers on supplier indus-
tries through the impact these deals had on the profits and prices of these companies.20
They found that horizontal deals reduced the profitability of dependent suppliers and
reduced their selling prices over a three-year period following the merger. They also
found that supplier industries that were more concentrated prior to the downstream
merger experienced greater price declines. This implies that perhaps the merger was
designed to achieve what John Galbraith called “countervailing power.”21 More recent
research has also found evidence of increased buying power, even in conglomer-
ate acquisitions. Green, Kini, and Shenoy analyzed a sample of 785 conglomerate
acquisitions over the period 1986–2010.22 They found evidence of increased buying
power over common supplier industries that were supplying inputs to both acquirers
and targets.
WACHOVIA: SUCCESSFUL PURSUIT OF SCOPE
ECONOMIES IN 2005, FOLLOWED BY A
DISASTROUS PURSUIT OF SIZE IN 2006
A
s discussed, over the past 20 years, the bank we now know as Wachovia grew
from a medium-sized bank to the ﬁfth largest bank in the United States. By 2005,
Wachovia commanded a huge base of depositors but not the product line width of
some of its large competitors. With its large depositor base, Wachovia had a great
amount of capital to lend but not enough business opportunities, such as consumer
loans, to lend these monies out. In 2000, the Charlotte, North Carolina–based bank
sold off its credit card and mortgage divisions due to their poor performance. It used
the monies from the sale of these business units to help ﬁnance Wachovia’s $13.6
billion merger with First Union in 2001. However, it still needed to be able to offer
customers services that other major banks offered—credit cards and mortgages. In
order to do that, Wachovia entered into agreements with MBNA for credit cards
and Countrywide Financial Corp. for mortgages.
In late 2005, Wachovia elected not to renew its ﬁve-year agreement with MBNA
and started to offer credit cards directly. In September 2005, Wachovia decided
to use M&A to accelerate its returns to the consumer ﬁnance business by buying
Westcorp Inc. for $3.9 billion (Westcorp has a signiﬁcant auto lending business).

This acquisition quickly made Wachovia the ninth largest auto lender in the United
States—a position more consistent with its overall size in the market. At the same
time, Wachovia also internally expanded its own mortgage lending business while
acquiring AmNet, a small West Coast mortgage company, for $83 million.a Through
a combination of internal development and M&A, Wachovia was quickly able to
achieve economies of scope.
The acquisition of Westcorp is a relatively modest deal when compared to the
bold acquisition of MBNA, the largest credit card issuer in the United States, by
Bank of America in June 2005 for $35 billion. While Wachovia had pursued some
negotiations for MBNA, a company that it was familiar and therefore somewhat
comfortable with, the pricetag of this deal was more than Wachovia wanted to
pay for a business that is much riskier than traditional banking. Up to that point
Wachovia had acquired a number of smaller companies. In doing so, it acquired the
expertise it needed in specialized areas, such as Westcorp’s skills in auto lending,
while not risking the capital needed to do a megadeal. With these moves, Wachovia
had achieved a broader product line without all of the risk that Bank of America
assumed with its MBNA deal.b However, Wachovia’s CEO changed his strategy in
2006 when Wachovia acquired Golden West Financial, the parent company of thrift
World Savings, for $25.5 billion. Golden West was the largest issuer of subprime
mortgages in the West and Southwest. It boasted a 285-branch network spanning 10
states. Its owners, Marian and Herb Sandler, who bought Golden West in 1964 for $4
million, smiled when they sold the bank at the top of the market to Wachovia, whose
CEO referred to Golden West as his “crown jewel.” His pursuit of size through M&A
proved to be the bank’s undoing. He was eventually ﬁred, and Wachovia was sold
to Wells Fargo in 2008 for $15 billion. Wachovia’s failed M&A strategy carries many
lessons. Relatively smaller, strategic deals can fuel proﬁtable growth and steady
expansion. However, the aggressive pursuit of size through M&A is fraught with peril.
While Wells Fargo was able to be the “savior” of Wachovia, it would come
to be a victim of its own poor management. While Wachovia may have had poor
controls on its mortgage issuance, and was involved in other scandals such as a
bond ﬁxing laundering of drug monies, in the years 2016–2017 Wells Fargo would
also have a series of scandals due to poor controls of its sales practices, which
resulted in the bank engaging in fraudulent sales of products to its own customers!
This damaged the bank’s reputation.

Financial Synergy
Financial synergy refers to the impact of a corporate merger or acquisition on the costs
of capital to the acquiring firm or the merging partners. Depending on the extent to
which financial synergy exists in corporate combinations, the costs of capital may be
lowered. Whether the benefits of such financial synergy are really reasonable, however,
is a matter of dispute among corporate finance theorists.
As noted, the combination of two firms may reduce risk if the firms’ cash flow
streams are not perfectly correlated. If the acquisition or merger lowers the volatility

144
◾
Merger Strategy
of the cash flows, suppliers of capital may consider the firm less risky. The risk of
bankruptcy would presumably be less, given the fact that wide swings up and down in
the combined firm’s cash flows would be less likely.
Higgins and Schall explain this effect in terms of debt coinsurance.23 If the
correlation of the income streams of two firms is less than perfectly positively correlated,
the bankruptcy risk associated with the combination of the two firms may be reduced.
Under certain circumstances, one of the firms could experience conditions that force
it into bankruptcy. It is difficult to know in advance which one of two possible firms
could succumb to this fate. In the event that one of the firms fails, creditors may suffer
a loss. If the two firms were combined in advance of financial problems, however, the
cash flows of the solvent firm that are in excess of its debt service needs would cushion
the decline in the other firm’s cash flows. The offsetting earnings of the firm in good
condition might be sufficient to prevent the combined firm from falling into bankruptcy
and causing creditors to suffer losses.
Theproblemwiththedebt-coinsuranceeffectisthatthebenefitsaccruetodebthold-
ers at the expense of equity holders. Debtholders gain by holding debt in a less risky
firm. Higgins and Schall observe that these gains come at the expense of stockholders,
who lose in the acquisition. These researchers assume that the total returns that can be
provided by the combined firm are constant (RT). If more of these returns are provided
to bondholders (RB), they must come at the expense of stockholders (RS):
RT = RS + RB
(4.3)
In other words, Higgins and Schall maintain that the debt-coinsurance effect does
not create any new value but merely redistributes gains among the providers of capi-
tal to the firm. There is no general agreement on this result. Lewellen, for example, has
concluded that stockholders gain from these types of combinations.24 Other research,
however, fails to indicate that the debt-related motives are more relevant for conglom-
erate acquisitions than for nonconglomerate acquisitions.25 Studies have shown the
existence of a coinsurance effect in bank mergers. Penas and Unal examined 66 bank
mergers and looked at the effects of these deals on 282 bonds.26 They found positive
bond returns for both targets (4.3%) as well as acquiring banks (1.2%). One explanation
that may play a role is that larger banks may be “too big to fail,” as regulators would not
want to allow a larger bank to fail outright and would step in to provide assistance.
Billet, King, and Mauer examined the wealth effects for target and acquirer returns
in the 1980s and 1990s.27 They found that target company bonds that were less than

investment grade prior to the deal earned significantly positive announcement period
returns. In contrast, acquiring company bonds earned negative announcement
period returns. They also found that these announcement period returns were greater
in the 1990s compared to the 1980s. These results support the coinsurance effect.
Higgins and Schall show that the stockholders’ losses may be offset by issuing new
debt after the merger. The stockholders may then gain through the tax savings on the
debt interest payments. Galai and Masulis have demonstrated this result.28 The addi-
tional debt would increase the debt–equity ratio of the postmerger firm to a level that
stockholders must have found desirable, or at least acceptable, before the merger. With
the higher debt–equity ratio, the firm becomes a higher risk–higher return investment.
As noted previously, a company may experience economies of scale through acqui-
sitions. These economies are usually thought to come from production cost decreases,
attained by operating at higher capacity levels or through a reduced sales force or a
shared distribution system. As a result of acquisitions, financial economies of scale may
be possible in the form of lower flotation and transaction costs.29
In financial markets, a larger company has certain advantages that may lower the
firm’s cost of capital. It enjoys better access to financial markets, and it tends to expe-
rience lower costs of raising capital, presumably because it is considered to be less risky
thanasmallerfirm.Therefore,thecostsofborrowingbyissuingbondsarelowerbecause
a larger firm would probably be able to issue bonds offering a lower interest rate than a
smaller company. For many years this was one of the benefits that GE bestowed upon
many of its acquired companies. Thus, larger companies may provide targets access to
an internal capital market.30 This is supported by research that has shown that diversified
companies, which tend to be larger than undiversified firms, have better credit quality
and better access to capital markets.31
More recently, Jang and Weisbach analyzed a sample of 5,187 European acqui-
sitions over the period 2001–2008 where each target became a subsidiary of the
acquirer.32 They focused on European acquisitions, as financial reporting in Europe
provides more information on subsidiaries than in the United States. In the United
States, financial reporting combines the assets of targets with the assets of the acquirer.
In most European countries, however, firms are required to report financial data on
an unconsolidated basis. Their results are quite intuitive. They found that after the
acquisitions, the targets held less cash, and their investments were less responsive to
cash flows and, in general, were greater after the acquisitions.

Merger Strategy
Another, more basic way financial synergy can work is when a company with large
financial resources and cash holdings but a paucity of high-return projects acquires a
“cash-strapped” target with certain high-return projects that it is not capable of funding.
Such deals can be a “win-win” for both firms.
DIVERSIFICATION
Diversification means growing outside a company’s current industry category. This
motive played a major role in the acquisitions and mergers that took place in the third
merger wave—the conglomerate era. Many of the firms that grew into conglomerates
in the 1960s were disassembled through various spin-offs and divestitures in the 1970s
and 1980s. This process of deconglomerization raises serious doubts as to the value of
diversification based on expansion.
Although many companies have regretted their attempts at diversification, others
can claim to have gained significantly. Up until recently, one such firm was General
Electric (GE). Contrary to what its name implies, for many years now GE has not been
merely an electronics-oriented company. Through a pattern of acquisitions and divesti-
tures, the firm has become a diversified conglomerate, with operations in insurance,
financial services, television stations, plastics, medical equipment, and so on.
During the 1980s and 1990s, at a time when the firm was acquiring and divesting
various companies, earnings rose significantly. The market responded favorably to these
diversified acquisitions by following the rising pattern of earnings.
Diversiﬁcation and the Acquisition of Leading Industry Positions
Part of the reasoning behind GE’s successful diversification strategy has been the types
of companies it has acquired. General Electric sought to acquire leading positions in the
various industries in which it owned businesses. Leading is usually interpreted as the
first or second rank according to market shares. It is believed by acquirers like GE that
the number-one or number-two position provides a more dominant position, which
affords advantages over the smaller competitors. These advantages can manifest them-
selves in a number of ways, including broader consumer awareness in the marketplace
as leading positions in distribution. Corporations in the secondary ranks, such as num-
bers four or five, may sometimes be at such a disadvantage that it is difficult for them
to generate rewarding returns. Companies within the overall company framework that
do not hold a leading position, and do not have reasonable prospects of cost-effectively
acquiring such a position, become candidates for divestiture. The released resources
derived from such a divestiture can then be reinvested in other companies to exploit
the benefits of their dominant position or used to acquire leading companies in other
industries.
Given that markets change, a business can be in an attractive industry and be a
leader in one decade only to see the industry contract in response to market changes.
Thus, diversified companies need to regularly reexamine their constituent units and
determine if a once-leading business is still a good fit and is really generating a return

consistent with the parent company’s goals. GE went through this evaluation process
in recent years and shed many units, including the consumer finance and media busi-
nesses. However, in 2015, in a return to the industrial orientation of the GE of old, it
acquired the energy business of Alstom SA.
CITIBANK: FINANCIAL SUPERMARKET THE
MARKET DID NOT WANT
T
he recent subprime crisis has underscored the concern about ﬁnancial institutions
that are too big to fail. Banking mergers and acquisitions (M&As) result in
larger ﬁnancial institutions that impose risks on the whole ﬁnancial system. When
a medium-sized ﬁnancial institution fails, the exposure to the rest of the system is
limited. When a large ﬁnancial institution fails, perhaps one that is large as a result
of a program of many M&As, the impact of its failure can be far-reaching. When
we have several such types of institutions taking similar risks, such as risk directly or
indirectly related to mortgage-backed securities, then the exposure of the banking
system is greatly magniﬁed. In addition, when banks such as Citigroup become so
large and diversiﬁed, the demands on management become much greater. When
Sandy Weil created the Citigroup ﬁnancial conglomerate based on a failed growth
strategy, and then handed off the management of the giant bank to Charles Prince,
an attorney by training and a man poorly equipped to understand and manage
such a complex ﬁnancial institution, it was only a matter of time before problems
would manifest themselves. This was exacerbated when one of its directors, the
politically savvy Robert Rubin, encouraged the bank to take more risks as a way to
elevate its returns. This is just what the bank did, and the rest is history.
Regulators were asleep at the wheel while Weill built a superbank based on
a strategy that made little sense. Laws designed to limit the growth of banks into
nonbanking businesses were disassembled to allow aggressive growth and risk
taking. Regulators were even more asleep when they allowed such an institution to
take on so much leverage and invest in risky assets, jeopardizing depositors’ assets.
There are many lessons to be learned from Citigroup’s failed growth through
M&A strategy. However, the history of M&A tells us that such lessons tend to be
quickly forgotten.
Diversiﬁcation to Enter More Proﬁtable Industries
One reason management may opt for diversified expansion is its desire to enter indus-
tries that are more profitable than the acquiring firm’s current industry. It could be that
the parent company’s industry has reached the mature stage or that the competitive
pressures within that industry preclude the possibility of raising prices to a level where
extranormal profits can be enjoyed.
One problem that some firms may encounter when they seek to expand by entering
industries that offer better profit opportunities is the lack of an assurance that those
profit opportunities will persist for an extended time in the future. Industries that are

148
◾
Merger Strategy
profitable now may not be as profitable in the future. Competitive pressures serve to
bring about a movement toward a long-term equalization of rates of return across
industries. Clearly, this does not mean that the rates of return in all industries at any
moment in time are equal. The forces of competition that move industries to have
equal returns are offset by opposing forces, such as industrial development, that cause
industries to have varying rates of return. Those above-average-return industries that
do not have imposing barriers to entry will experience declining returns until they
reach the cross-industry average.
Economic theory implies that in the long run, only industries that are difficult to
enter will have above-average returns. This implies that a diversification program to
enter more profitable industries will not be successful in the long run. The expanding
firm may not be able to enter those industries that exhibit persistently above-average
returns because of barriers that prevent entry, and may be able to enter only the indus-
trieswithlowbarriers. Whenentering the low-barrierindustry, theexpanding company
will probably be forced to compete against other entrants who were attracted by tem-
porarily above-average returns and low barriers. The increased number of competitors
will drive down returns and cause the expansion strategy to fail.
MONTANA POWER: FAILED CORPORATE
TRANSFORMATION
T
he story of Montana Power is one of a company that existed for decades as a
stable but slow-growth power utility. During the 1990s, its management began
the process of transforming it into a telecommunications company. The end result
was a disaster.
Montana Power was founded in 1912. It moved into oil and gas in the 1930s and
then expanded into coal in the 1950s. Its initial entry into the telecommunications
business began in the 1980s, when it took advantage of the breakup of AT&T. It
slowly began to expand its position in the telecommunications business by laying
more ﬁber and building more of its own network.
In February 2001, the company eventually sold off its “boring” power utility
business for $1.3 billion and invested the proceeds into a high-ﬂying telecommuni-
cations business called Touch America. The energy distribution business was sold
to NorthWestern Corporation for $612 million in cash plus the assumption of $488
million in debt.a The monies from the sale were invested in Touch America’s tele-
com business. In August 2000, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. agreed to purchase
Montana Power’s oil and gas business for $475 million.b This acquisition increased
PanCanadian’s oil ﬁeld capacity by providing it with properties in Alberta, Montana,
and Colorado. It was indicated by PanCanadian that the accrued ﬁelds had reserves
of 550 billion cubic feet of gas and 20 million barrels of crude oil. In the summer of
2000, Touch America then entered into a deal to buy Quest’s in-region long-distance
network, which regulatory constraints forced Quest to divest pursuant to an agree-
ment related to its acquisition of U.S. West—one of the seven superregionals that
were formed in the breakup of AT&T. This $200 million deal gave Touch America

long-distance operations in 14 states with sales of approximately $300 million in
revenues and 250,000 customers.c
After the sell-off of the power utility business, Montana Power changed its
name to Touch America Holdings Inc. The company was traded on the New York
Stock Exchange. For a while, it was highly touted by the market and the industry.d
Touch America started off as a growing, largely debt-free company in a growing
industry. Initially, it seemed that the combination of rapid growth without debt
pressures made Touch America highly desirable. However, all was not well in the
telecom sector, and Touch America’s fate declined with the industry. While its 2001
results were impressive, in the second and third quarters of 2002 the company
generated losses of $32.3 million and $20.9 million. This occurred even though
revenues increased. At the time Touch America sold off its utility business, its stock
was as high as $65 per share. By the third quarter of 2003, the stock had fallen to
$0.53 per share and was delisted.e
Like many companies in the telecom sector, Touch America had invested heav-
ily in network expansion and ﬁber laying throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.
Billions of dollars were spent on laying ﬁber-optic cable as telecom and nontele-
com companies expanded. The result is that 360 networks held over 87,000 miles of
ﬁber-optic cable, linking urban areas in North America, Asia, and South America.f
Touch America was one such company. The overcapacity in the industry fueled
increased competition and declining margins. Only the more savvy companies
would survive, and newcomer Touch America was not one of them. Touch America
ﬁnally ﬁled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 19, 2003, but assets were
eventually put up for sale despite the objections of various creditors.

Positive Evidence of Beneﬁts of Conglomerates
Many studies question the risk-reduction benefits of conglomerates. However, some
studies cast the wealth effects of conglomerates in a better light. For example, one study
by Elger and Clark has shown that returns to stockholders in conglomerate acquisitions
are greater than in nonconglomerate acquisitions.33

Management 9, no. 2 (Summer 1980): 66–72.

Merger Strategy
The study, which examined 337 mergers between 1957 and 1975, found that
conglomerate mergers provided superior gains relative to nonconglomerate mergers.
The researchers reported these gains for both buyer and seller firms, with substantial
gains registered by stockholders of seller firms and moderate gains for buying company
stockholders. This finding was supported by later research by Wansley, Lane, and Yang.
They focused on 52 nonconglomerate and 151 conglomerate mergers. It was also
found, however, that returns to shareholders were larger in horizontal and vertical
acquisitions than in conglomerate acquisitions.34
Is There a Diversiﬁcation Discount?
Using the aforementioned large sample drawn from the 1960s, Henri Servaes compared
the Tobin’s qs of diversified firms to those that were not diversified. He found no evidence
that diversification increased corporate values. On the contrary, he found that the
Tobin’s qs for diversified firms were significantly lower than those for multisegment
companies. Other research has found that the diversification discount was not restricted
to the conglomerate era. A study conducted by Berger and Ofek, using a large sample
of firms over the 1986–1991 sample period, found that diversification resulted in
a loss of firm value that averaged between 13% and 15%.35 This study estimated
the imputed value of a diversified firm’s segments as if they were separate firms. The
results found that the loss of firm value was not affected by firm size but was less
when the diversification occurred within related industries. The loss of firm value
results were buttressed by the fact that the diversified segments showed lower operat-
ing profitability than single-line businesses. The results also showed that diversified
firms overinvested in the diversified segments more than single-line businesses. This
implies that overinvestment may be a partial cause of the loss of value associated with
diversification.
Value-reducing effects of diversification were detected by Lang and Stulz.36 Using
a large sample of companies (in excess of 1,000), Lang and Stulz found that greater
corporate diversification in the 1980s was inversely related to the Tobin’s q of these
firms. Like Berger and Ofek, when these findings are combined with those of Lang and
Stulz, we see that diversification often lowers firm values. Finance researchers, however,
do not universally accept this conclusion. Villalonga believes that the diversification
discount is merely an artifact of the data used by these researchers.37 He states that the
data used by these researchers were artificially restricted by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board definition of segments, as well as requirements that only segments
that constitute 10% or more of a company’s business are required to be reported. Using

a data source that is not affected by this problem, Villalonga finds a diversification
premium, as opposed to a discount. As we will discuss further, this issue is a com-
plicated one, and it is hard to draw broad generalizations about diversification that
universally apply.
FOCUS HYPOTHESIS
Other studies have tackled the problem differently. Comment and Jarrell analyzed a sam-
ple of exchange-listed firms from 1978 to 1989. They found that increased corporate
focus or specialization was consistent with shareholder wealth maximization.38 They
concluded that the commonly cited benefits of diversification, economies of scope, go
unrealized and that the access to greater internal capital does not appear to affect the
diversified firm’s propensity to pursue external capital. One “benefit” of diversification
that was found was that diversified firms tend to be targets of hostile takeovers less fre-
quently than their less diversified counterparts. Nonetheless, diversified firms were more
active participants, as both buyers and sellers, in the market for corporate control.
Some studies have explored the issue of which firms are the most likely to diversify.
These studies have shown the poorer performing firms are more likely to diversify than
their better performing counterparts.39 One would think that if this is true, it is
motivated by managers of relatively poorly performing companies trying to enter
industries that generate higher returns. Critics of the diversification discount point to
this research as saying that the studies that find such a discount are not controlling
for endogenous factors stemming from poorly performing firms doing the acquisitions
and possibly extending their poor management to the diversified entities they acquire.
However, studies that have attempted to control for these endogenous factors also find
a diversification discount.40
Types of Focus Increases
A study by Dasilas and Leventi analyzed the types of focus-increasing spin-offs that
had the greatest positive shareholder wealth effects.41 Their research compared
spin-offs that increased industrial focus with those that increased geographical
focus. Spin-offs that increased industrial focus generated positive shareholder wealth
effects while those that increased geographical focus did not. In addition, the positive
market response to increases in industrial focus was greater for U.S. spin-offs than it
was for European deals.

Focus Increasing Asset Sales Increase Firm Values
When companies notice their market values are below the values that would result from
determining the estimated market value of all their major business units as stand-alone
entities,theymaylooktoassetsalestoraisetheirequityprice.JohnandOfekusedseveral
accounting measures of performance, such as operating margins and return on assets,
to determine if a company’s performance improved after it sold off assets.42 They com-
pared 321 divestitures that resulted in greater focus with ones that did not. They found
that only those firms in their sample that had greater focus after the assets sales showed
improved performance. Those that sold assets but did not have an increase in focus failed
to show improved performance. Thus, their conclusion is that it is the focus-enhancing
effects of the divestitures, not just the simple act of a divestiture, that are the source of
the value gains. These value gains can then serve to undo the diversification discount.
POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE DIVERSIFICATION
DISCOUNT
On the surface, we may be led to simply conclude that diversification itself destroys
value. We can easily think of some very logical explanations for this destruction process.
Perhaps it is the greater managerial demands of a diverse and less focused enterprise
that limit the potential of diverse companies. Perhaps it is simply wasteful managers
who pursue diverse M&As for their own self-interests. For example, the larger diversified
company might compensate its senior managers much better and allow them to believe
they were great empire builders. However, could it also be the greater analytical demands
such enterprises present for market analysts who may be inclined to assign them lower
valuations compared to more focused business?
Many analysts specialize in a type of business. For example, in its heyday, Altria was
followed by tobacco analysts, who covered the Philip Morris part of the business, but also
food analysts, who covered the Kraft side. Investors had to put the two together when
assessing the investment prospects of the overall entity. The problem was even more
challenging when Altria owned Miller beer and beer industry analysts had to chime in
with their thoughts about this relatively weaker business.
An interesting study by Lamont and Polk of a large sample of 2,390 diverse firms,
covering the 19-year period of 1979 through 1997, raises some questions regarding a
simple explanation for value destruction of diverse companies.43 Among their various
findings was that companies with discounts have higher subsequent returns than com-
panies that trade at a premium! Could it be that the market is incorrectly assigning
discounts that turn out to be wrongfully assigned when the diverse firms end up gen-
erating higher returns than what the discounts implied?

Possible Explanation for the Diversiﬁcation Discount

The Lamont and Polk study is just one part of the answer to the diversification
discount. Their analysis focused on just returns; there are many other measures,
such as profitability, capital expenditures, and other fundamental measures, that may
give support for the traditional explanations of the diversification discount, such as
irrational managers, productivity, corporate waste, and so on. However, for adherents of
behavioral finance, whose ranks have been rapidly growing, one additional explanation
for the diversification discount may be that the market irrationally undervalues diverse
companies. At a minimum, the Lamont and Polk research sheds light on the complexity
of the diversification puzzle.
Related versus Unrelated Diversiﬁcation
Diversification does not mean conglomerization. That is, it is possible to diversify into
fields that are related to the buyer’s business. An example of a related diversification
occurred in 1994, when Merck purchased Medco. Merck is one of the largest pharma-
ceutical companies in the world, and Medco is the largest marketer of pharmaceuticals
in the United States. The two businesses are different in that one company is a manu-
facturer and the other company is a distributor. Nonetheless, the two companies are
both in the broadly defined pharmaceutical industry, and each has a greater knowledge
of the other’s business than an outside firm would have. In addition, there may be a
more reliable expectation of economies of scale and scope in related diversifications
because a buyer may be better able to leverage its current resources and expertise if
it stays closer to its current business activities. However, while these two companies
were leaders in their respective segments of the drug industry, their combination
did not yield synergistic benefits. Merck assumed that in the world of managed care,
owning a company such as Medco would provide it competitive advantages. Indeed,
shortly after the Merck-Medco merger in 1994, some of Merck’s competitors thought
the same, as Roche acquired Syntex Corp. for $5.3 billion and Eli Lilly bought PCS
Health Systems for $4.1 billion. Unfortunately, relatedness was not enough to ensure
success, and Merck and Medco had to later undo the deal after concluding that
they did not understand the regulatory environment that would not allow Medco to
influence the usage by physicians and consumers of its drugs. This eliminated certain
synergistic benefits.
It is not always clear when another business is related in a meaningful way. One
example put forward by Young and Morck is the 3M Corp.44 3M is well known for
its brand of Scotch tape. This company was able to extend its brand name to other
products whose manufacturing and marketing have some commonalities with its main
business activities.
The track record of related acquisitions is significantly better than that of unrelated
acquisitions. Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny found that the market punished sharehold-
ers in companies that engaged in unrelated acquisitions, whereas shareholders in
44 Bernard Young and Randall Morck, “When Synergy Creates Real Value,” in Mastering Strategy (Upper
Saddle River, NJ: Financial Times Press, 1999).

154

Merger Strategy
companies that made related acquisitions did significantly better.45 Their study of 326
acquisitions between 1975 and 1987 presented a more favorable picture of this type
of diversification. Rather, a particular form of diversification, unrelated diversification,
showed poor results. They measured relatedness by determining if the two firms had at
least one of their top three lines of business in the same Standard Industrial Classifica-
tion (SIC) code. Not all the research on related diversification shows the same results.
For example, the result found by Agrawal, Jaffe, and Mandelker was the opposite of the
result of Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny. Their result showed that unrelated acquisitions
outperformed related acquisitions.46 The market performance of diversified firms is
discussed later in this chapter.
Atkas, de Bodt, and Roll showed that for companies and CEOs who engage in
multiple acquisitions, the average time between deals was greater for related deals.47
One reasonable explanation for this is that related targets present the potential of more
synergistic gains and thereby are more likely to bring about an auction process that
may consume more time and generate higher premiums for their shareholders.
LVMH: IS LUXURY RELATED?
I
f the track record of related diversiﬁcations is better than unrelated, then how do
we deﬁne related? This is not that obvious and, unfortunately, is open to inter-
pretation. If it is misinterpreted, it can result in losses for shareholders. One such
example was LVMH’s ﬁfth merger wave expansion strategy. LVMH, which stands for
Louis Vuitton, Moet, and Hennessy, led by its ﬂamboyant chief executive ofﬁcer
(CEO), Bernard Arnault, seems to see any connection to luxury to be related. The
Paris-based company went on an acquisition binge that focused on a wide variety
of companies that marketed products or services to upper-end customers. This led
it to acquire such major brand names as Chaumet jewelry, Dom Perignon (part of
Moet), Fendi, Givenchy, Donna Karan, Loewe leather goods, Sephora, TAG Heuer,
Thomas Pink shirts, and Veuve Clicquot champagne. The company has become a
clearinghouse for luxury products, but the combination of various acquired compa-
nies has provided few, if any, synergies. Many of the acquired businesses, such as
Fendi and Donna Karan, while major international brands, generated few proﬁts. In
November 1999, LVMH stretched the luxury-related connection by buying ﬁne art
auctioneer Phillips de Pury & Luxembourg for $115 million. However, in doing so,
Arnault violated several rules of merger success. First, he acquired a company that
was a distant third behind Sotheby’s and Christie’s. Second, he stretched the deﬁ-
nition of related so far that there were no possible synergies. Finally he acquired a

company that needed a large cash infusion with little potential for it to be recouped.
As with many other failed deals, CEO Arnault went unchecked by his directors, and
shareholders paid the price. LVMH eventually admitted this failure and sold off the
art auctioneering company at a loss. Clearly, deﬁning related as any luxury good or
service was a faulty strategy. Relatedness is a subjective concept; the more narrow
the deﬁnition, the more likely the deal will be successful. Nonetheless, if anything,
LVMH has expanded its deﬁnition of related in 2015 when it acquired the daily
newspaper Le Parisien-Aujourd’hui en France. More consistent with past deals,
though, in 2015–2016 it also acquired numerous luxury-related assets throughout
the world, from Brazil to Russia.
Like all conglomerates which have enjoyed some success, LVMH regularly
revisits its portfolio of companies/brands and disposes of those which are not
making a sufﬁcient contribution. For example, in 2016 it sold off Donna Karan for
$650 million. It had already sold the auction house Phillips de Pury & Luxembourg.
Like all such selloffs of prior acquisitions, management was reluctant to admit the
poor strategic ﬁt of these prior deals.
The LVMH that we see today seems to have stood the test of time, even though
its strategy raises some questions. As Figure A shows, it is quite diversiﬁed within
the so-called luxury market. It also is quite diversiﬁed internationally (see Figure B).
Its global strength and reputation helped it successfully expand into markets such
as Asia.

One of the beneﬁts of being a large international luxury conglomerate has
been the ability to grow by taking advantage of all available global alternatives. We
see in Figures C and D that while the global recession slowed LVMH’s revenue and
proﬁt growth in 2009, the company recovered impressively, although proﬁt ability
weakened in 2015–2016—partly due to economic weakness in Asia and Europe.

DO DIVERSIFIED OR FOCUSED FIRMS DO BETTER
ACQUISITIONS?
We have examined the benefits and costs of a diversified, as opposed to more focused
business structure. However, a separate question is which type of companies, diversified
or focused, are better at M&A. Cihan and Tice analyzed a large sample of 1,810 deals
over the period 1981–2010.48 They found that diversified firms had 1.5% higher
announcement returns than single-segment bidders. They then went on to try to find
the source of the higher value for diversified acquirers. They conducted a regression
analysis in which postmerger performance measures reflecting profitability and costs
were regressed against bidders’ diversification status and premerger performance.
They found, for example, “that SG&A is 1.8% to 2.6% lower for firms with diversified
acquirers than for firms with focused acquirers.”49 The combined companies where the
bidder was diversified had higher profit margins and lower costs. These results imply
that diversified acquirers are better able to implement postdeal efficiency improvements
compared to more focused bidders.

Other Economic Motives

157
OTHER ECONOMIC MOTIVES
In addition to economies of scale and diversification benefits, there are two other
economic motives for M&As: horizontal integration and vertical integration. Horizontal
integration refers to the combination of firms that are at the same stage in the production
process or supply chain. An example of such a horizontal combination, this one in
the medical device sector, was the 2017 $24 billion acquisition of C.R. Bard by the
Becton Dickinson Company. Another was the acquisition of Craftsman by Stanley Black
and Decker in the same year. Vertical integration refers to the merger or acquisition of
companies that have a buyer-seller relationship. An example of a vertical deal was
insurer United Health Group’s 2017 acquisition of Surgical Care Affiliates Inc. through
its Optum subsidiary, which provides healthcare while the parent company, United,
insures patients receiving care.
Horizontal Integration
When two competitors merge, they may have an opportunity to realize certain
economies given the fact that they each know the other’s business and may have
a good sense of where redundant costs could be eliminated. They should also have a
good sense, compared to nonhorizontal deals, such as diversifications, of the product
market impact of the combination. Albert Sheen examined the product quality reports
shown in Consumer Reports magazine over the period 1980–2009.50 He found when
two competitors merge, the quality of their brands converges. While the overall quality
of the combined brands did not change significantly, the prices of the products fell.
This seems to imply that there may be real cost-related synergies from such horizontal
combination.
Horizontal combinations that result in an increase in market share may have a sig-
nificant impact on the combined firm’s market power. Whether market power actually
increases depends on the size of the merging firms and the level of competition in the
industry. Economic theory categorizes industries within two extreme forms of market
structure. On one side of this spectrum is pure competition, which is a market charac-
terized by numerous buyers and sellers, perfect information, and homogeneous, undif-
ferentiated products. Given these conditions, each seller is a price taker with no ability
to influence market price. On the other end of the industry spectrum is monopoly, which
is an industry with one seller. The monopolist has the ability to select the price-output
combination that maximizes profits. Of course, the monopolist is not guaranteed a profit
simply because it is insulated from direct competitive pressures. The monopolist may
or may not earn a profit, depending on the magnitude of its costs relative to revenues
at the optimal “profit-maximizing” price-output combination. Within these two ends
of the industry structure spectrum is monopolistic competition, which features many
sellers of a somewhat differentiated product. Closer to monopoly, however, is oligopoly,
50 Albert Sheen, “The Real Product Market Impact of Mergers,” Journal of Finance 69, no. 6 (December 2014):
2651–2688.

158
◾
Merger Strategy
in which there are a few (i.e., 3 to 12) sellers of a differentiated product. Horizontal
integration involves a movement from the competitive end of the spectrum toward the
monopoly end.
Market Power
Market power, which is sometimes referred to as monopoly power, is defined as the ability
to set and maintain price above competitive levels. Because in the long run sellers in a
competitive industry earn only a normal return and do not earn economic rent, compet-
itive firms set price equal to marginal cost. Market power refers to the ability to set price
in excess of marginal cost. Abba Lerner developed what has been known as the Lerner
index, which measures the magnitude of the difference between price and marginal cost
relative to price. Simply having a positive difference between price and marginal cost,
however, does not guarantee profits, because fixed costs could be sufficiently high that
the firm generates losses.
Lerner index = P −MC∕P
(4.4)
where:
P
= price
MC = marginal cost
There are three sources of market power: product differentiation, barriers to entry,
and market share. Through horizontal integration, a company is able to increase its
market share. It could be the case that even with a substantial increase in market share,
the lack of significant product differentiation or barriers to entry could prevent a firm
from being able to raise its price significantly above marginal cost. If an industry does not
possess imposing barriers to entry, raising price above marginal cost may only attract
new competitors who will drive price down toward marginal costs. Even in industries
that have become more concentrated, there may be a substantial amount of competi-
tion. In addition, if prices and profits rise too high, new entrants may enter such con-
testable markets quickly, raising the degree of competition.
Secular Trend in Market Power in United States
While there has been concern in the business media about rising levels of concentration
inmanyindustries,suchanincreaseinconcentrationbyitselfdoesnotnecessarilymean
there has been an increase in market power, although it does imply that conditions are
ripe for such an increase. Fortunately, this issue has been addressed by DeLoecker and
Eeckhout.51 They analyzed a large sample of all public firms in the Compustat database
over the period 1950–2014. They found that while the markup of price above marginal
cost was relatively constant over the period 1960–1980, there has been a steady rise

starting in 1980. Over that period markups rose from roughly 1.2 in 1980 to 1.67 by
2014 (see Figure 4.1). By 2014, the average public company charged prices that were
67%abovemarginalcostswhilein1980thedifferencewasonly18%.Interestingly,they
did not find that larger firms had higher markups. DeLoecker and Eeckhout analyzed the
macroeconomic factors that they believe caused the increase in markups. Among those
factors were a weakening of labor’s share of national income as well as the decrease in
the labor force participation rate as well as the decline of the wages of low skill workers.
They also found that the profitability of the public companies in their sample rose even
faster than the growth of markups, which supports the intuitive conclusion that higher
markups imply greater market power.
Empirical Evidence on M&As and Market Power
Research in this area has approached the question of whether M&As increase market
power using two broad methodologies. One focuses on the stock price effects of rivals
of the merged companies, whereas other studies focused on product prices. If a merger
results in increased market power for the combined company, we would expect a posi-
tive stock price effect for the bidder. Indeed, if the industry became more concentrated
after the combination and competitors also benefited from greater market power, we
would expect their stock prices to rise as well. Unfortunately, just focusing on stock price
effects does not enable us to discern if the cause of the positive response was due to
greatermarketpower,orincreasedefficiency,orboth.Thus,stockpricestudiesalonewill
not allow us to conclude that a positive equity market response was due to the greater
market power.

Merger Strategy
Early studies by Stillman and also by Eckbo found that rival firms received either
zero or some positive stock market responses to horizontal merger announcements.52
The Stillman and also the Eckbo study sample periods featured more aggressive
antitrust enforcement than in the years that followed. Schumann analyzed a sample
of 37 merger proposals that were challenged by the FTC over the years 1981–1987.53
While the time period and the level of antitrust enforcement were very different in the
Schumann sample compared to the Stillman and Eckbo study periods, the results were
similar. Schumann detected a statistically significant positive stock price effect around
the announcement of the deal but no effect in response to the filing of the antitrust
complaint. Once again, the market power collusive hypothesis was not supported.
A later study by Eckbo expanded the time period and number of horizontal merger
proposals and actually found a negative stock market response—which clearly provides
no support for the market power hypothesis.54 Some studies focused on specific indus-
tries, and their findings were similar to the broad-based studies of Stillman and Eckbo,
Becher, Mulherin, and Walking, which found negative industry wealth effects when
analyzing horizontal mergers in the electric utility industry.55 Akdogu detected similar
effects when he studied the telecommunications industry.56
Several other studies examined the effects in markets outside of the United
States. These studies found negative stock price effects for rivals. For example, using
a U.S.-Canadian sample, Eckbo found such negative industry wealth effects on rivals
following horizontal merger announcements.57 In a sample drawn from the European
Union, Aktas, de Bodt, and Roll also found negative abnormal returns when analyz-
ing a sample of horizontal mergers, several of which were challenged on antitrust
grounds.58
When we consider the variety of studies that are broad-based, industry-specific, and
international in their perspective, it seems clear that there is little support for the view
that firms merge to collude and achieve monopoly power. This does not mean that this
never occurs. It simply means that, in general, this is not the case.
Other research went on to focus on the role of consumers and suppliers. First focus-
ing on rival firms, both Fee and Thomas and also Shahrur reported positive shareholder
wealth effects around the merger announcements. Fee and Thomas analyzed a sample

of 554 horizontal transactions over the period 1980–1997.59 They used accounting
rules that require reporting of data on customers, which comprise 10% or more of a
given public company’s sales. They also traced the sales of suppliers. The question they
were addressing was, What was the source of the positive stock market response? Both
Fee and Thomas as well as Shahrur determined that price increases for customers were
not the source of the positive stock market responses. However, when focusing on sup-
pliers, the results were different. Both Fee and Thomas and Sharhur did find evidence of
losses to suppliers, which implies the positive shareholder wealth effects may come from
some monopsonist buying power. Fee and Thomas, who analyzed a sample of 463 hori-
zontal mergers and tender offers over the period 1987–1999, went on to explore further
the source of the supplier losses. They found that the losses came from the termination of
the supply relationship. When the relationship remained intact, suppliers did not incur
losses. In other words, if the M&A causes the supplier to “lose the account,” they will
incur losses—a very common-sense outcome.
Structural Remedies and Horizontal Mergers
Companies pursuing horizontal M&As may encounter antitrust concerns from reg-
ulators that may require them to implement structural remedies such as the sale of
specific units. Nain and Qian analyzed a sample of 1,153 horizontal mergers over the
period 1980–2010.60 They found that post-merger increase in product prices was
smaller when the deal was accompanied by divestitures, as opposed to not having to
dispose of assets. This limit on price increases was greater when the buyer of the assets
was outside the industry of the merged companies. These results seem to confirm that
structure remedies, such as asset sales, do limit market power.
Horizontal Integration, Consolidation, and Roll-Up Acquisition Programs
The 1990s featured a consolidation within certain industries. Many of these deals
involved larger companies buying smaller rivals in a series of acquisitions. The acquired
companies were then combined into an ever-growing larger company. Such deals are
sometimes referred to as roll-up acquisitions.
The market of the 1990s liked roll-ups, although not as much as it was enamored
with Internet companies. The typical market that was attractive to consolidators
was one that featured many relatively smaller competitors in an industry that was
fragmented and unconcentrated. Many of the targets in such industries, such as those
in the bus transportation or the funeral home business, were closely held. The owners
lacked liquidity, and being acquired by a large public company enabled them to convert
their illiquid, closely held shares into a more liquid asset. Consolidators were able to
convince the market that the large-scale acquisition of these smaller targets would
enable the combined company to realize scale economies while also enhancing sales

through a greater ability to service national clients. The scale economies were supposed
to have many sources, including increased buying power that a national company
would have compared to a small regional firm. A whole host of roll-up companies were
formed in the United States during the fifth wave, with names such as Coach USA,
Metals USA, and Floral USA.
For many of the privately held sellers, the dream of liquidity, combined with an
attractive premium, proved to be a nightmare. This was the case in the funeral home
industry, where big consolidators like Service Corp. and Leowen encountered financial
problems; Leowen eventually had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Many
consolidators were good at only one thing—doing deals. They were not good managers,
and it took the market a long time to come to this realization.
Serial Acquirers and Corporate Acquisitions Programs
Roll-up acquisitions are a form of serial acquisitions. Dealmakers combine fragmented
industries to form larger, typically national, companies. Serial acquirers engage in an
acquisition program that might not involve consolidation. Cisco is an example of a com-
pany that used many M&As to fuel revenue and profit growth in the 1990s. However, in
recent years, competitors, such as Arista, started to eat into Cisco’s market share in the
switching business. Oracle is another company that has used a pattern of serial M&As
to greatly expand its position in its industry. While these companies may be able to cite
M&As as a source of some of their success, the track record of serial acquirers is not that
favorable. Indeed Aktas, de Bodt, and Roll show that returns to acquiring firms and their
CEOs decline as a function of the number of deals they do.61
WORLDCOM
O
ne classic example of a consolidation acquisition program is the acquisitions
of WorldCom, formerly LDDS, over the second half of the 1980s and the 1990s.
WorldCom, based in Jackson, Mississippi, was formed through a series of more than
40 acquisitions, culminating in the $37 billion acquisition of MCI in 1998. Many of
these deals were acquisitions of regional long-distance telecommunication resellers,
who added more minutes to WorldCom’s market clout while bringing a regionally
based sales force to service the acquired market. It is ironic that WorldCom was
a telecommunications business owned by ITT that was later acquired by LDDS.
ITT was a conglomerate that underwent a series of downsizing transactions (see
Chapter 10), whereas LDDS went on to grow horizontally to become the second
leading long-distance company in the U.S. market. In paying a high price for MCI,
which enabled it to outbid British Telecom, WorldCom asserted that it would realize
signiﬁcant cost savings from combining these two long-distance companies.
WorldCom is a classic example of a company run by a chief executive ofﬁcer
(Bernie Ebbers) who was a good dealmaker but a bad manager. The company’s
board was asleep at the wheel and allowed its CEO to pursue deals when the

company was already of a sufﬁcient size. They also allowed him to continue to run
the company when he was clearly out of his element. He continued to pursue deals,
but the company became so large that meaningful deals, such as the proposed
acquisition of Sprint, were halted by antitrust regulators. It has been alleged that
management resorted to illegal means to try to manufacture proﬁts that it could
not otherwise achieve. The end result of this acquisition program was an inefﬁcient
company that spiraled into the largest bankruptcy of all time. For his role in a fraud
on the market, Bernie Ebbers was sentenced for 25 years in prison—a questionably
long sentence.
Further support was provided by Ismail, who studied 16,221 takeovers over the
years 1985–2004 and found that single acquirers, companies that pursue only one
acquisition, outperformed multiple acquirers by 1.66%.62
Many of the roll-up deals of the 1990s fell into bankruptcy when the market eupho-
ria and economic expansion of that period came to an end. Some, such as Coach USA, a
company put together by consolidator Simon Harter, were sold to other buyers. Others,
such as Wayne Huizinga’s Waste Management and Blockbuster Video, and Jonathan
Ledecky’s Cort Business Services, survived the collapse of the roll-ups. Still others, such
as Westinghouse, thrived.
Serial Acquirers and M&A Expertise
The research on serial acquirers tends to support the idea that companies that depend
on M&As as the main source of their growth will realize diminishing returns over time.
However, there may be important exceptions. That is, there is evidence to also support
the view that certain acquirers who engage in repeat acquisition may be better at M&As
than other firms and they can realize extra-normal performance even after they pursue
multiple M&As over years. Companies such as Cisco Systems seem to be good examples
of this.
Golubov, Yawson, and Zhang analyzed a sample of 12,491 completed acquisitions
involving 4,128 companies over the years 1990–2011.63 They found certain acquirers
generate extraordinary performance that is persistent over time. Such extraordinary
acquirers seem to continue to make good acquisitions while bad repeat acquirers do the
opposite. The extraordinary performance of these good acquirers continued even after
the CEO changed, so it was not so CEO-driven.
Characteristics of Serial Acquirers
What do we know about the characteristics of serial acquirers? Macias, Rasu, and
Stouraitis analyzed a large sample of 56,095 M&As involving 9,166 unique acquirers

over the period 1984–2013.64 With respect to the number of deals, the distributions of
acquirers is quite skewed.
In this large sample, a little over a quarter of the acquirers only did one M&A and
another 1,500 did just two while 1,317 acquirers did 14% of all the M&As. In fact, 81
did 50 or more M&As and 12 did more than 100 during the sample period. We see that
a relatively small number of acquirers do a significant number of acquisitions and rely
on M&As for a major part of their growth.
Rise of Superstar Firms
The issue of the rise of “superstar” firms and the alleged resulting negative impact on
worker compensation has become a hot topic in microeconomics. The term superstar
firms refers to certain large companies that have grown to attain dominant positions
in their respective industries. With the growth of these companies, concentration
increased significantly in certain industries. Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely have
pointed out that three quarters of U.S. industries experienced an increase in concentra-
tion, as measured by Herfindahl Hirschman indices, over the past two decades while
the average publicly traded company is three times larger, in real terms, than it was two
decades ago.65 The market shares of the top four companies in most industries have
increased significantly while approximately half of the publicly traded companies in the
United States have disappeared. M&As have played a significant role in this process.
Grullon et al. found significant announcement period returns for firms that announce
M&As that increased concentration. This has become a controversial topic when this
increased concentration is related to weak real wage growth on workers. That issue is
also related to the rising inequality in Western nations.66 As this topic receives further
attention, it may put pressure on regulators to limit horizontal M&As that further
increase concentration.
Vertical Integration
Vertical integration involves the acquisition of firms that are closer to the source of sup-
ply or to the ultimate consumer. An example of a movement toward the source of supply
was Chevron’s acquisition of Gulf Oil in 1984. Chevron bought Gulf primarily to aug-
ment its reserves, a motive termed backward integration. In the same year, Mobil bought
Superior Oil for similar reasons. Mobil was strong in refining and marketing but low
on reserves, whereas Superior had large oil and gas reserves but lacked refining and
marketing operations. A recent example of a proposed backward transaction is the 2017
proposed $66 billion bid by drug chain CVS for health care insurer Aetna. An example
of forward integration would be if a firm with large reserves bought another company
that had a strong marketing and retailing capability.

MERCK’S ACQUISITION OF MEDCO: AN
EXAMINATION OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION
AND COPYCAT M&A
I
n July 1993, Merck & Co., the largest pharmaceutical company in the world at
that time, acquired Medco Containment Services for $6.6 billion. Medco was the
largest prescription beneﬁts management company. With the drug industry expe-
riencing the effects of managed care, pharmaceutical companies had to adapt to
new means of distribution. Merck realized that the decisions of what treatments and
what drugs should be used in patients’ care were increasingly being inﬂuenced by
the managed care environment rather than by physicians. In the world of managed
care, it was no longer sufﬁcient to market just to physicians. The successful phar-
maceutical companies of the future would be companies that were able to adapt
to the changed distribution system.
This vertical integration move by Merck was not lost on its rival drug compa-
nies. Shortly after the Medco acquisition, other drug companies began their own
acquisitions so as not to leave Merck with better channels to the ultimate consumer.
Toward that end, in 1994, Eli Lilly bought PCS Health Systems for $4.1 billion, while
Roche Holdings bought Syntex Corp. for $5.3 billion. This is an example of copycat
acquisitions, as Merck’s competitors instinctively reacted to a perceived competitive
advantage that Merck may have achieved. Copycat acquisitions are very common.
The automobile industry did the same with its forward and backward vertical inte-
gration strategies as well as its international expansion programs. All of these have
yielded questionable results for many of these companies.
Merck and its copycat competitors, however, did not do their homework.
Regulatory concerns arose regarding Merck possibly unduly inﬂuencing consumers’
prescription alternatives through Medco. Merck was forced to eventually undo this
acquisition.
Another example of forward integration took place in the securities industry when
ShearsonLehmanBrothersboughtE.F.Hutton.ShearsonwasattractedbyE.F.Hutton’s
strong network of retail brokers. This vertical combination was motivated by a move-
ment toward the consumer. It is also an example of a previously vertically integrated
firm that wanted to expand its access to the consumer. Before the merger, Shearson
Lehman had a large network of retail brokers. After the merger, however, it acquired
a retail capacity to rival all competitors, including Merrill Lynch. Although this strat-
egy of combining seemingly complementary and closely related businesses appeared to
make sense, it also was later undone and the firms were sold off.
Motives for Vertical Integration
A firm might consider vertically integrating for several reasons. As seen in the case of the
Mobil–Superior Oil combination, companies may vertically integrate to be assured of a
dependable source of supply. Dependability may be determined not just in terms of supply
availability but also through quality maintenance and timely delivery considerations.

166
◾
Merger Strategy
Having timely access to supplies helps companies to provide their own products on a reli-
able basis. In addition, as companies pursue just-in-time inventory management, they
may take advantage of a vertically integrated corporate structure to lower inventory
costs.
It is popularly believed that when a company acquires a supplier, it is obtaining a
cost advantage over its rivals. The thinking is that it will not have to pay the profit to
suppliers that it was previously paying when it was buying the inputs from independent
suppliers. This raises the question: What is the appropriate internal transfer price? It is the
price carried on the company’s books when it acquires its supplies or inputs from a sup-
plier that it now controls and may be a subsidiary. If the price for these inputs is less than
the prevailing market price, the parent company will appear to be more profitable than
it really is. The reason is that the lower costs and higher profits for the parent company
come at the cost of lower profitability for the subsidiary. This is a paper transfer, however,
and does not result in increased value to the combined firm.
Although the establishment of an accurate transfer price helps dismiss the illusion
that supplies derived from a newly acquired supplier come at a lower cost, there may
be other cost savings from acquiring a supplier. These savings may come in the form of
lower transactions costs.67 By acquiring a supplier and establishing a long-term source
of supply at prearranged costs, the acquiring firm may avoid potential disruptions that
might occur when agreements with independent suppliers end. When the buyer owns
the supplier, it may be better able to predict future supply costs and avoid the uncertainty
that normally is associated with renegotiation of supply agreements.
Still another reason for vertical integration could arise from the need to have spe-
cialized inputs. These may be custom-designed materials or machinery that might have
little or no market value other than to the buyer. The buyer may then be at the mercy of
these companies if they choose not to provide the products. It may be difficult to switch
to other suppliers if there are fixed costs associated with the initial manufacture of the
materials. Other suppliers may be unwilling to produce the specialized products unless
the buyer compensates for the initial costs or enters a long-term supply agreement that
allows the supplier to amortize the up-front costs. One way to eliminate this problem is
to acquire the supplier. The buyer can then have access to these specialized inputs and be
in an even better position to oversee the maintenance of the company’s own standards
of manufacturing. In Chapter 13, however, we will explore whether some of these goals
can be better accomplished through lower costs, joint ventures, or strategic alliances.
Another interesting example of vertical integration occurs in the marketing of auto-
mobiles. Automobile manufacturers have long realized that they may need to provide
potential buyers with financial assistance, in the form of less expensive and more readily
available credit, to sell more cars. For this reason, General Motors (GM) formed General
MotorsAcceptanceCorporation(GMAC).GeneralMotorsAcceptanceCorporation,now
Ally Financial Inc., provides low-cost credit to many car buyers who might not be able
to get the financing necessary to buy a new car. Companies such as GMAC were able to

VERTICAL INTEGRATION IN THE AUTOMOBILE
INDUSTRY
F
or a period of time, all of the U.S. automakers were vertically integrated, both
backward and forward, in one form or another. General Motors, the number-one
auto company in the world for many years, owned its own supplier, Delphi, which
is the largest parts supplier in the automobile business. GM spun off this entity
in 1999. Ford was in the auto supply business for many years, going back to the
decision of Henry Ford to create his own parts supplier and avoid reliance on other
suppliers, such as those controlled by the Dodge brothers. Ford spun off this entity
in 2000 when it formed Visteon. Unfortunately, due to the tight hold the United Auto
Workers (UAW) had on these two companies, they could not sever their ﬁnancial
obligations to the workers at these companies. Ford was forced to take back many
of Visteon’s employees in 2005. When Delphi ﬁled for bankruptcy, it reminded GM
that it must honor obligations to its workers.
There are many suppliers of parts, and by buying a large percentage of their
parts from their own captive suppliers, both Ford and GM, in effect, were purchasing
parts at higher prices than what they would otherwise pay if they were dealing with
suppliers who did not have the same burdensome labor agreements with the
UAW. Both Ford and GM, and other automakers, pressure their suppliers to be
very competitive in their prices. The combination of intensely competitive pricing,
combined with high labor costs, did not make this an attractive business for Ford
and GM.
At one time, Chrysler, Ford, and GM all were vertically integrated forward
through their purchases of car rental companies. In 1989, Chrysler bought Thrifty
Rent-A-Car, which in turn bought Snappy Rent-A-Car in 1990. In addition, Chrysler
solidiﬁed its presence in the car rental business by buying Dollar Rent-A-Car in
1990. Lee Iacocca termed the combination a “natural alliance.” However, what was
natural in 1990 became unnatural just a few years later.
Similarly, in 1988, GM acquired a 45% interest in National Car Rental. The
company also owned an interest in Avis—the number-two company in the industry.
Ford acquired Hertz, the number-one company in the car rental industry, in 1987
from Allegis for $1.3 billion.
The automakers thought that the purchase of the larger buyers of their cars,
car rental companies, would lock in demand for their products. In addition, the
entry of these automakers into the car rental business is an example of “copycat”
acquisitions as one auto manufacturer did not want to let another one gain market
share at its expense. Market share has always been a major focus in the auto industry
as the industry has a huge investment in capital in its plants as well as relatively
ﬁxed obligations to workers that are not ﬂexible due to the pressures from the UAW.
(continued )

Merger Strategy
(continued )
These burdensome agreements with the UAW caused the companies to lose market
share to non-U.S. manufacturers, such as Toyota and Honda, who built nonunion
plants in the United States that enjoyed major cost advantages over their U.S. rivals.
Unfortunately for the U.S. automakers, the sales gained from deals with the car
rental industry were not very proﬁtable. Car rental companies, being large buyers,
purchase at attractive prices and require the manufacturers to buy back these autos
after a period such as one year, so that they can maintain a relatively modern ﬂeet
of vehicles. The terms of these sales were not good for U.S. car companies because
they used such sales, along with heavily discounted promotional sales and rebate
offers, to try to offset their shrinking market shares. Foreign automakers, such as
Toyota, Nissan, and Honda, steered clear of this part of the market and focused on
gaining market share while maintaining proﬁtability.
As U.S. automakers began to rethink the beneﬁts of forward vertical integration,
they began to extricate themselves from the car rental business. GM took a $300
million charge related to National Car Rental and had to write down the goodwill
on its balance sheet stemming from National. In 1995, it sold National to Lobeck
for $1.3 billion. In 1997, Chrysler did an equity carve-out of its car rental business for
$387.5 million. Finally, in 2005, Ford sold off Hertz to a private equity group. Ironically,
Hertz was a proﬁtable business, valued at approximately $15 billion. However, at
that time Ford was losing money and market share and had to sell off this asset to
try to consolidate its business.
By the mid-2000s, the U.S. automakers had reversed many of their vertical
integration efforts (to the extent the UAW agreement allowed them to). Clearly,
their moves to vertically integrate were not a success.
HUBRIS HYPOTHESIS OF TAKEOVERS
An interesting hypothesis regarding takeover motives was proposed by Roll.68 He con-
sidered the role that hubris, or the pride of the managers in the acquiring firm, may play
in explaining takeovers. The hubris hypothesis implies that managers seek to acquire
firms for their own personal motives and that the pure economic gains to the acquiring
firm are not the sole motivation or even the primary motivation in the acquisition.
Roll and others have researched this hypothesis to explain why managers might
pay a premium for a firm that the market has already correctly valued. Managers, they
claim, have superimposed their own valuation over that of an objectively determined
market valuation.69 Their position is that the pride of management allows them to
believe that their valuation is superior to that of the market. Implicit in this theory is an
underlying conviction that the market is efficient and can provide the best indicator of

Hubris Hypothesis of Takeovers

the value of a firm. Many would dispute this point. As evidence, there is a wide body of
research studies that we review in the following section.
Empirical Evidence
A large body of research covering a quarter of a century has lent support to the hubris
hypothesis as an explanation for many takeovers. Early research sought to see if the
announcements of deals caused the target’s price to rise, the acquirer’s to fall, and
the combination of the two to result in a net negative effect. Various studies lend support
for some or all of these effects.
Early Research
A number of studies show that the acquiring firm’s announcement of the takeover
results in a decline in the value of the acquirer’s stock. Dodd found statistically sig-
nificant negative returns to the acquirer following the announcement of the planned
takeover.70 Other studies have demonstrated similar findings.71 Not all studies support
this conclusion, however. Paul Asquith failed to find a consistent pattern of declining
stock prices following the announcement of a takeover.72
There is more widespread agreement on the positive price effects for target stock-
holders who have been found to experience wealth gains following takeovers. Bradley,
Desai, and Kim show that tender offers result in gains for target firm stockholders.73
Admittedly, the hostile nature of tender offers should produce greater changes in
the stock price than friendly takeover offers. Most studies, however, show that target
stockholders gain following both friendly and hostile takeover bids. Varaiya showed
that bidders tend to overpay.74
In a study that examined the relationship between the bid premium and the com-
bined market values of the bidder and the target, it was found that the premium paid
by bidders was too high relative to the value of the target to the acquirer. The research
on the combined effect of the upward movement of the target’s stock and the downward
movement of the acquirer’s stock does not seem to provide strong support for the hubris
hypothesis. Malatesta examined the combined effects and found that “the evidence indi-
cates that the long-run sequence of events culminating in merger has no net impact on
combined shareholder wealth.”75 It could be countered, however, that Malatesta’s fail-
ure to find positive combined returns does support the hubris hypothesis.

Merger Strategy
Later Research
Later research lends support to the hubris hypothesis by approaching the problem
differently.76 Using a sample of 106 large acquisitions, Hayward and Hambrick found
CEO hubris positively associated with the size of premiums paid. Hubris was measured
by variables such as the company’s recent performance and CEO self-importance
(as reflected by media praise and compensation relative to the second-highest paid
executive). The study also considered independent variables, such as CEO inexperience,
as measured by years in that position, along with board vigilance, as measured by the
number of inside directors versus outside directors (see Figure 4.2).
Other studies provide support for the hubris hypothesis for takeover of U.S. firms by
foreign corporations. Using shareholder wealth effect responses similar to those theo-
rized by Roll, in a sample of 100 cross-border deals over the period 1981 to 1990, Seth,
Song, and Pettit found that hubris played an important role in these deals.77 Other fac-
tors, such as synergy and managerialism, also played a role. Managerialism is somewhat
similar to hubris, in that both may involve overpaying for a target. In managerialism,
however, the bidder’s management knowingly overpays so as to pursue their own gains,
even though it comes at the expense of their shareholders—to whom they have a fidu-
ciary obligation.
Malmendier and Tate investigated the role that overconfidence played in deals done
by 394 large companies.78 They measured overconfidence by the tendency of CEOs to

overinvest in the stock of their own companies and their statements in the media. They
found that the likelihood of doing acquisitions was 65% higher for the overconfident
group of CEOs in their sample. They also determined that overconfident CEOs were
more likely to make lower-quality, value-destroying acquisitions. Billet and Qian
further researched the role of overconfidence by examining the acquisition history of
2,487 CEOs and 3,795 deals over the years 1980–2002.79 CEOs who had a positive
experience with acquisitions were more likely to pursue other acquisitions. These CEOs’
net purchases of their company’s own stock were greater prior to the subsequent deals
than they were prior to the first deals. The researchers interpret this result as these
CEOs being overconfident and attributing the success of the original deal to their own
managerial abilities and superior insight.
Aktas, de Bodt, and Roll showed that overconfident and hubris-filled CEOs tend to
do deals more rapidly and there is less time between their deals.80 They also noted there
was a “learning effect,” in which CEOs who had done more deals in the past tended
to act faster and have less time between their deals. This learning effect has been sup-
ported by other research by these same authors.81 The research of Aktas et al., as well
as other studies, has shown that the cumulative abnormal returns of serial acquirers

cator of hubris as the CEOs continue to pursue deals that generate decreasing returns
to shareholders. Others opine that the declining returns could merely be a function of
less productive opportunities available in the marketplace. While this is a possible causal
explanation, it still seems that the hubris-filled CEOs should refrain from continuing an
acquisition program when the returns fall below some specific targeted return.
DO MANAGERIAL AGENDAS DRIVE M&A?
Managers have their own personal agendas, and these may differ from that of the com-
pany. For managers, and CEOs in particular, it may be to extend their stay in their posi-
tions and to continue to receive what in the United States are bountiful compensations
and perks. This monetary compensation is on top of the psychic income they receive
from being “the Big Cheese.”
Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny analyzed 326 acquisitions over the period 1975–
1987.82 They found that bad deals were driven by the objectives of the managers doing
the deals. They found that three types of acquisitions caused lower and usually negative
announcement period returns. These were: diversifying M&As, acquiring a rapidly
growing target, and acquiring a company when the managers have a poor performance

track record prior to the deals. Their findings about diversification are further evidence
that such a strategy is questionable. However, their results related to rapidly growing
targets probably reflect the fact that it is hard to “buy growth,” and when you do, you
will likely be forced to overpay. We saw this in Chapter 3.
Their findings related to bad managerial track records are also quite intuitive. If
you are bad at running the business you have, adding to it and thereby increasing the
managerial demands will only worsen managerial performance. Perhaps managers are
good at managing a specific type of focused business. Allowing them to foray into areas
beyond their knowledge base may be a prescription for disaster. On the other hand,
senior management at companies that have been historically diverse, such as GE, is
in the business of managing very diverse enterprises. These management abilities are
their skill set. In effect, this is what they do.
VIVENDI AND MESSIER’S HUBRIS: ANOTHER
FAILED CORPORATE TRANSFORMATION
V
ivendi Universal SA (Vivendi) is a colorful case study involving a stodgy French
water utility run by a chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO) who wanted to be a high-ﬂying
leader of an international media company. He eventually transformed this water
utility into a media giant. The only problem was that he sacriﬁced shareholders’
interests to do so. Shareholders picked up the tab for his grandiose dreams, and
when they failed he walked away with too much of their money in his pockets and
in the pockets of others he brought in to help with his schemes.
Vivendi’s roots come from being a 100-year-old water utility that was housed in
an entity eventually called Vivendi Environment SA. When the division was sold off
as part of the bust-up of the company, it raised 2.5 billion euros. This was a relatively
small amount compared to the losses that Messier’s media empire would generate.
If Vivendi’s ﬁnancial performance had been good, no one would have ques-
tioned the apparent lack of synergy between Vivendi’s water and entertainment
industry assets. Unfortunately, the combination of the two produced very poor
results. The company lost 23 billion euros in 2002, which followed a 13.6 billion euro
loss in 2001. This was the largest corporate loss in French history. Vivendi cannot
be proud that its 2002 23.6 billion euro loss narrowly passed the prior record of 23
billion euros that was held by French Telecom. As the situation worsened in 2002,
major shareholders pushed for action—they were just a few years too late.
CEO Messier was not satisﬁed with being the CEO of a water utility. Messier
had a dealmaker’s background. He was formerly an investment banker at Lazard
LLC, where he spent six years of his business career. If you put an investment banker
at the helm of a water utility, odds are that he is going to engage in investment
banker–like activities. Messier, originally a utility CEO, became an entertainment
CEO by engaging in major acquisitions of entertainment companies.
One of Messier’s big deals was to buy Seagram Universal in 2000. This sale
gave the Bronfmans, major shareholders in Seagram, 88.9 million shares in Vivendi,
which constituted 8.9% of the company.a This acquisition marked Vivendi’s major

foray into the media industry by buying a company that itself was a combination
between the liquor and soft drinks company, Seagram, and the Universal movie
studios. It is quite ironic that Messier would buy Seagram Universal as this company
was formed by the acquisition engineered by young Edgar Bronfman when he took
a leadership position at Seagram. He used the assets and cash ﬂows of the Seagram
family business to ﬁnance its venture into the entertainment sector. This deal went
through its own rocky period as the movie business proved to be not as exciting to
Seagram’s shareholders as it was to the young Mr. Bronfman.
Messier’s acquisition plans did not stop with Seagram Universal. He then bought
Canal Plus—a pay-cable French TV network, which also owned shares in British Sky
Broadcasting. He then purchased Barry Diller’s USA Networks in December 2001
for $10.3 billion, only to see its value drop, like many other Messier purchases. The
deal brought together the Universal Studios Group with the entertainment assets
of the USA Networks to form what they called Vivendi Universal Entertainment. As
with so many other acquisitions, Vivendi stated that it hoped to realize signiﬁcant
synergies that would improve content, ratings, and subscriber fees.b
Messier paid 12.5 billion euros for Canal Plus, even though there were sig-
niﬁcant limitations on the ability of any buyer to make signiﬁcant changes at the
European cable company to make the programming more proﬁtable. Canal Plus
was not proﬁtable and had approximately 2.8 billion euros of debt.c Messier also
bought a 44% stake in Cegetal—a French phone company that owned 80% of
SFR, France’s second biggest mobile phone operator. In addition, the company
purchased Houghton Mifﬂin, a book publisher, for $2.2 billion, which included $500
million in debt. Vivendi also owned an equipment division that held U.S. Filter
Corporation.
In the midst of his acquisition binge, Messier, the CEO of this water/worldwide
media company, moved to New York in September 2001. To say that Messier was
ﬁlled with hubris seems to be an understatement. He himself concedes that this
may be a normal characteristic of a CEO. In his book, he stated, “Don’t ask a
CEO to be modest. The costume does not ﬁt him. A strong ego, not to say an
outsized one, is more becoming, although each has its way of wearing.” We would
have to say that when this ego leads the company down the path of billions in
losses, it can be very draining on the value of investors’ portfolios. Messier loved
the limelight—especially the lights of New York—much to the chagrin of his French
management and shareholders.
When Vivendi began to rack up huge losses, shareholders and creditors began
to call for an end of the acquisition binge and the ouster of its colorful CEO. After
a new, supposedly more conservative management team of Chairman Jean-Rene
Fourtou and CEO Bernard Levy were put in place, the company began the slow
and costly process of disassembling the media and utility conglomerate that the
hubris-ﬁlled Messier had built. They sold four Gulfstream corporate jets, a castle
outside Paris, and a publishing company.d The new management returned the
company to proﬁtability while enjoying stable growth in revenues. In 2009 the
company announced it was selling its 20% stake in NBC Universal and would use
some of the billions it received to pursue “bolt-on” acquisitions. They started the
M&A process again and acquired Brazil telecom company GVT for $1.87 billion. In
2011 it acquired the recorded music division of EMI for $1.87 billion. Finally, the

board had enough and Levy was forced to step down. The sell-offs then resumed,
and in 2013 Vivendi sold its interest in Activism Blizzard for $13.2 billion.

Winner’s Curse Hypothesis of Takeovers
The concept of the winner’s curse was first put forward by three engineers at Atlantic
Richfield who discussed auctions for oil drilling rights and the challenges of bidding for
assets whose true value is difficult to estimate.83 The winner of these bidding contests
can then be cursed by putting forward a winning bid that exceeds the value of the assets.
Richard Thaler has demonstrated how the winner’s curse could work in a variety of
contexts, including mergers and acquisitions.84
The winner’s curse of takeovers is the ironic hypothesis that states that bidders who
overestimate the value of a target will most likely win a contest. This is due to the fact
that they will be more inclined to overpay and outbid rivals who more accurately value
the target. This result is not specific to takeovers but is the natural result of any bidding
contest.85 One of the more public forums where this regularly occurs is the free agent
markets of sports such as baseball and basketball.86 In a study of 800 acquisitions from
1974 to 1983, Varaiya showed that on average the winning bid in takeover contests
significantly overstated the capital market’s estimate of any takeover gains by as much as
67%.87 He measured overpayment as the difference between the winning bid premium
and the highest bid possible before the market responded negatively to the bid. This study
provides support for the existence of the winner’s curse, which in turn also supports the
hubris hypothesis.
Do Bad Bidders Become Good Targets?
Given that many acquisitions have failed to live up to expectations, the question arises:
Does the market punish companies that make bad acquisitions? Using a sample of

1,158 companies, Mitchell and Lehn examined their control transactions from 1980
to 1988.88 They determined that companies that make acquisitions that cause their
equity to lose value are increasingly likely to become takeover targets. That is, they
found that “the likelihood of becoming a takeover target is significantly and inversely
related to the abnormal stock price performance with the firm’s acquisitions.”89 Their
analysis shows that takeovers may be both a problem and a solution. Takeovers that
reduce market value may be bad deals, assuming the market correctly assesses them,
and this is a problem. The deals market, however, may take care of the problem through
another takeover of the “bad bidder.” The Mitchell and Lehn analysis also implies that
just looking at the returns to acquirers, which research has shown may be zero or
slightly negative, obscures the picture because it aggregates good deals and bad deals.
When the negative market impact of bad deals is taken into account, it becomes clear
that good acquisitions should have a positive impact on share values, whereas bad deals
should cause the stock price of these acquirers to lag behind the market.
Fortunately, there is some evidence that the corporate governance process may
eventually address the poor performance of the “bad acquirer” CEOs. In an analysis of
390 firms over the period 1990–1998, Lehn and Zhao found an inverse relationship
between the returns of acquiring firms and the likelihood that the CEOs would be
fired.90
Executive Compensation and Corporate Acquisition Decisions
One theory of acquisitions that is closely related to the hubris hypothesis is the theory
that managers of companies acquire other companies to increase their size, which, in
turn, allows them to enjoy higher compensation and benefits.91 Khorana and Zenner
analyzed the role that executive compensation played in the corporate acquisition deci-
sions of 51 firms that made 84 acquisitions between 1982 and 1986.92 For companies
that engaged in acquisitions, they found a positive relationship between firm size and
executive compensation but not for those that did not. However, when they separated
good acquisitions from bad acquisitions, they found that good acquisitions increased
compensation, whereas bad deals did not have a positive effect on compensation. When
the fact that bad deals may result in departures from the firm is taken into account, there
is even a negative relationship between bad acquisitions and executive compensation.
More recent evidence from the fifth merger wave provides evidence that CEOs
receive compensation for doing deals. Grinstein and Hribar conducted a study using
a database of 327 large deals drawn from the period 1993 to 1999.93 In examining

proxy statements that identified the components of CEO compensation, they found that
in 39% of the cases the board of directors’ compensation committee cited completing
deals as one of the reasons why the compensation was at the level it was.
OTHER MOTIVES
Improved Management
Some takeovers are motivated by a belief that the acquiring firm’s management can bet-
ter manage the target’s resources. The bidder may believe that its management skills are
such that the value of the target would rise under its control. This leads the acquirer to
pay a value for the target in excess of the target’s current stock price.
The improved management argument may have particular validity in cases of large
companies making offers for smaller, growing companies. The smaller companies, often
led by entrepreneurs, may offer a unique product or service that has sold well and facil-
itated the rapid growth of the target.
The growing enterprise may find that it needs to oversee a much larger distribu-
tion network and may have to adopt a very different marketing philosophy. Many of the
decisions that a larger firm has to make require a different set of managerial skills from
those that resulted in the dramatic growth of the smaller company. The lack of man-
agerial expertise may be a stumbling block in the growing company and may limit its
ability to compete in the broader marketplace. These managerial resources are an asset
that the larger firm can offer the target.
Little significant empirical research has been conducted on the importance of the
improved management motive. The difficulty is determining which takeovers are moti-
vated solely by this factor, because improved management usually is just one of several
factors in the acquirer’s decision to make a bid. It is difficult to isolate improved manage-
ment and to explain its role in the bidding process. The argument that takeover offers
by large companies for smaller, growing companies are motivated in part by managerial
gains may be reasonable.
For large public firms, a takeover may be the most cost-efficient way to bring about
a management change. Proxy contests may enable dissident stockholders to oust the
incumbent management, whom they may consider incompetent. One problem with this
process is that corporate democracy is not very egalitarian. It is costly to use a proxy fight
to replace an incumbent management team. The process is biased in favor of manage-
ment, who may also occupy seats on the board of directors. It is therefore difficult to win
a proxy battle. The proxy process is explained in detail in Chapter 6.
Improved Research and Development
Research and development (R&D) is critically important to the future growth of many
companies, particularly pharmaceutical companies. This was one of the reasons for the
consolidation that occurred in the pharmaceutical industry in the fifth merger wave.
For example, the $73 billion megamerger between Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline

Other Motives

177
Beecham in 1999, which formed the largest company in that industry at that time,
merged the R&D budgets of two companies. This was estimated to equal an annual total
of $4 billion, which was, at that time, more than double the R&D budgets of some of
their larger rivals, such as Pfizer and Merck. In response, other companies began to look
for their own merger targets so as to remain competitive in pharmaceutical R&D. This
helps explain the successful 2000 acquisition by Pfizer of Warner-Lambert. Not only did
this deal give Pfizer enhanced R&D, but also it filled up its drug pipeline, including the
addition of the largest-selling drug in the world—Lipitor. Interestingly, Pfizer acquired
Warner Lambert by breaking up a bid from American Home Products—a company
that would later go under the name of one of its units—Wyeth. In 2000 Pfizer acquired
Wyeth and its promising group of blockbuster drugs. Pfizer was also able to combine
the two company’s R&D departments.
The drug development and approval process is a slow one, oftentimes taking
over 10 years. It is also quite expensive, with a blockbuster drug (a drug with annual
sales in excess of $1 billion) costing as much as $1 billion to develop. The Federal
Drug Administration approves relatively few drugs per year, making the problem of
drugs coming off patent protection a challenging issue for large drug companies. The
drug discovery process has evolved over time, with the role of biotech research being
very important. This helps explain why in 2009 Pfizer acquired Wyeth. Wyeth had a
number of blockbuster drugs that it marketed. In addition, it had a promising “biologic”
research program investigating treatments for important illnesses, such as Alzheimer’s,
schizophrenia, and antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, to name a few.
MERCK: INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OR M&A—
THE PURSUIT OF NEW DRUGS
D
uring the ﬁfth merger wave, widespread consolidation took place in the phar-
maceutical industry. One of the motives for such deals was the mounting cost
of the research and development (R&D) needed to come up with new drugs. Such
factors help explain the megamergers that took place between Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham in 1999 and the merger between Pﬁzer and Warner-Lambert
in 2000. However, not all the industry leaders decided that merging was the best
way to enhance product development.
One prominent example is the internal development program that was pur-
sued by Merck as an alternative to M&As. Part of the problem continually facing
pharmaceutical companies is that patents, which allow developers to recoup the
substantial costs of drug development, eventually expire, subjecting the company
to competition with generic “knockoffs.” For example, two of Merck’s big sellers
were Vasotec, an antihypertensive drug that was scheduled to come off patent pro-
tection in August 2000, and Mevacor, an anticholesterol drug that would lose patent
protection in December 2001.a Amid the consolidation going on in its industry in
the ﬁfth wave, Merck was left with the choice to continue to use internal resources to
come up with replacement drugs or to engage in expensive acquisitions to replace
(continued )

(continued )
the drugs about to come off patent protection. Merck decided to go it alone. Using
internal R&D it came up with a number of promising replacement drugs, such as
the anti-inﬂammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor—Vioxx.
For a while, Merck’s decision not to acquire R&D externally raised many
questions. Merck had enjoyed impressive revenue growth in the 1980s, but this
growth slowed in the ﬁrst half of the 1990s. By the beginning of 2001, Merck was
again among the industry leaders in revenue growth and proﬁtability while maintain-
ing its independence. This growth was stunted in 2005–2006, when it encountered
a massive wave of Vioxx-related lawsuits.
However, in 2009 Merck departed from its internal growth strategy when it
agreed to acquire rival Schering-Plough Corp. for $41 billion. Part of the reason for
this was that the internal development process stopped bearing fruit, and some of its
leading products, such as asthma treatment Singulair, which had global sales of $4.3
billion in 2008, were coming off patent protection. If Merck kept pursuing internal
development, it may have had to accept being a signiﬁcantly smaller pharmaceutical
company. In the years after the Schering deal, Merck continued to pursue M&A as
a way of offsetting an industry-wide lack of R&D productivity. In 2011, it acquired
Inspire Pharmaceuticals, and in 2014 it acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for $3.85
billion and antibiotics maker Cubist Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion. Part of the
funds for these deals came from the sale of Merck’s consumer business to Bayer
for $14.2 billion. In 2015, Merck acquired OncoEthix, and in 2016 it acquired IOmet
Pharma and Afferent.
a Gardiner Harris, “With Big Drugs Dying, Merck Didn’t Merge—It Found New Ones,” Wall
Street Journal, January 10, 2001.
While drug companies used M&A as a means to make up for blockbuster drugs
that were coming off patent protection, the track record of M&A as a means to greatly
enhance R&D has not been impressive. In the pharmaceutical industry, M&A has
been more successful in creating large global sales and distribution organizations
and wringing out cost savings from the consolidation of acquired targets. Even with
respect to R&D, drug companies recognized that there were great redundancies in the
separate R&D departments that different drug firms maintained. Merck was able to
benefit from this in 2010 by closing 16 such sites following its 2009 acquisition of
Schering. Nonetheless, while the large drug firms’ key need is productive R&D, the large
bureaucratic structures created by megamergers have not been fertile environments
for development of new blockbuster drugs.
Improved Distribution
Companies that make a product but do not have direct access to consumers need to
develop channels to ensure that their product reaches the ultimate consumer in a prof-
itable manner. Vertical mergers between manufacturers and distributors or retailers
often give competitor manufacturers cause for concern, in that they worry about being
cut off from distribution channels. Locking in dependable distribution channels can be
critical to a firm’s success.

Other Motives

179
PEPSI: UNDO SELL-OFF TO IMPROVE
DISTRIBUTION
I
n 1999, in a robust equity market, PepsiCo Inc. spun off in an initial public offering
(IPO) its lower-margin bottling business. PepsiCo’s stock had been weak for years
even in the bull market, and it was hoped this move would help lift its stock price.
The company also used the IPO proceeds to lower its risk proﬁle by paying down
debt. This move is what many similar businesses have done as they have discovered
that distribution is capital- and labor-intensive and not where the proﬁtability of the
business lies—or so it seemed at the time. Following those transactions, two large
bottling ﬁrms became independent public companies on which PepsiCo depended
for its distribution.
By the late 2000s, PepsiCo had a change of heart and regretted losing control
over its distribution. It had retained minority stakes in the two bottlers but could
not control the strategy of these companies, which deviated from Pepsi’s.
In recent years, as the U.S. consumer became increasingly health-conscious, soft
drink sales weakened. Pepsi wanted to promote more sales of water and enhanced
water products. The bottlers wanted access to Gatorade, which Pepsi owned but
which is manufactured through a different process than what the bottlers use to
make soda and which is distributed through a more traditional warehouse system.
In addition, the bottlers began to distribute Crush soda, made by the Pepsi rival Dr.
Pepper Snapple Group. As a result, the former Pepsi distribution system became
a distribution channel for Pepsi’s competition. All this was too much for Pepsi to
take, and in August 2009, it reached an agreement to reacquire the bottlers for
$7.8 billion.
Tax Motives
Whether tax motives are an important determinant of M&As has been a much-debated
topic in finance. Certain studies have concluded that acquisitions may be an effective
means to secure tax benefits. Gilson, Scholes, and Wolfson have set forth the theoreti-
cal framework demonstrating the relationship between such gains and M&As.94 They
assert that for a certain small fraction of mergers, tax motives could have played a signif-
icant role. Hayn, however, has empirically analyzed this relationship and has found that
“potential tax benefits stemming from net operating loss carry forwards and unused tax
credits positively affect announcement-period returns of firms involving tax-free acqui-
sitions, and capital gains and the step-up in the acquired assets’ basis affect returns
of firms involved in taxable acquisitions.”95 Moreover, whether the transaction can be
structured as a tax-free exchange may be a prime determining factor in whether to go
forward with a deal. Sellers sometimes require tax-free status as a prerequisite of approv-
ing a deal. We discuss the tax aspects of M&As in Chapter 16.

CHAPTER FIVE
Antitakeover Measures
A
NTITAKEOVER MEASURES HAVE EVOLVED greatly over the past quarter of a
century. Corporate takeovers reached new levels of hostility during the 1980s.
This heightened bellicosity was accompanied by many innovations in the art
of corporate takeovers. Although hostile takeover tactics advanced, methods of corpo-
rate defense were initially slower to develop. As a result of the increased application of
financial resources by threatened corporations, however, antitakeover defenses became
quite elaborate and more difficult to penetrate. By the end of the 1980s, the art of anti-
takeover defenses became very sophisticated. Major investment banks organized teams
of defense specialists, who worked with managements of larger corporations to erect
formidable defenses that might counter the increasingly aggressive raiders of the fourth
merger wave. After installing the various defenses, teams of investment bankers, along
with their law firm counterparts, stood ready to be dispatched in the heat of battle to
advise the target’s management on the proper actions to take to thwart the bidder. By
the 1990s, most large U.S. corporations had in place some form of antitakeover defense.
In the 2000s, the trend reversed somewhat as pressure built for companies to be more
measured in their implementation of these defenses.
The array of antitakeover defenses can be divided into two categories: preventative
and active measures. Preventative measures are designed to reduce the likelihood of a
financially successful hostile takeover, whereas active measures are employed after a
hostile bid has been attempted.
This chapter describes the more frequently used antitakeover defenses. The impact
of these measures on shareholder wealth, a controversial topic, is explored in detail.
Opponents of these measures contend that they entrench management and reduce
the value of stockholders’ investment. They see the activities of raiders, or their more
modern version, activist hedge funds, as an element that seeks to keep management

Antitakeover Measures
“honest.” They contend that managers who feel threatened by raiders will manage the
firm more effectively, which will, in turn, result in higher stock values. Proponents of
the use of antitakeover defenses argue, however, that these measures prevent the actions
of the hostile raiders who have no long-term interest in the value of the corporation but
merely are speculators seeking to extract a short-term gain while sacrificing the future
of the company, which may have taken decades to build.
MANAGEMENT ENTRENCHMENT HYPOTHESIS VERSUS
STOCKHOLDER INTERESTS HYPOTHESIS
The management entrenchment hypothesis proposes that nonparticipating stockholders
experience reduced wealth when management takes actions to deter attempts to take
control of the corporation. This theory asserts that managers of a corporation seek to
maintain their positions through the use of active and preventative corporate defenses.
According to this view, stockholder wealth declines in response to a reevaluation of this
firm’s stock by the market.
The shareholder interests hypothesis, sometimes also referred to as the convergence
of interests hypothesis, implies that stockholder wealth rises when management takes
actions to prevent changes in control. The fact that management does not need to devote
resources to preventing takeover attempts is considered a cost savings. Such cost savings
might come in the form of management time efficiencies savings, reduced expenditures
in proxy fights, and a smaller investor relations department. The shareholder interests
hypothesis can also be extended to show that antitakeover defenses can be used to maxi-
mize shareholder value through the bidding process. Management can assert that it will
not withdraw the defenses unless it receives an offer that is in the shareholders’ interests.
The shareholder wealth effects of various antitakeover measures, both preventative
and active, are examined with an eye on the implications of the validity of these two
competing hypotheses. If the installation of a given antitakeover defense results in
a decline in shareholder wealth, this event lends some support to the management
entrenchment hypothesis. If, however, shareholder wealth rises after the implementa-
tion of such a defense, the shareholder interests hypothesis gains credence. An early
study by Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny examined the validity of these two competing
hypotheses separate from a consideration of antitakeover defenses.1 They considered
the entrenchment of managers along with several other relevant factors, such as
management’s tenure with the company, personality, and status as a founder, and
other factors such as the presence of a large outside shareholder or an active group of
outside directors. The study examined the relationship between Tobin’s q—the market
value of all of a company’s securities divided by the replacement costs of all assets—as
the dependent variable and the shareholdings of the board of directors in a sample of
371 of the Fortune 500 firms in 1980. They found that Tobin’s q rises as ownership

stakes rise. The positive relationship was not uniform in that it applied to ownership
percentages between 0% and 5% as well as to those above 25%, whereas a negative
relationship applied for those between 5% and 25%. The positive relationship for all
ownership percentages, except the 5% to 25% range, provides some support for the
shareholder interests hypothesis, because higher ownership percentages imply greater
entrenchment, which in turn was shown to be associated with higher values of
securities except the intermediate range of 5% to 25%. The conflicting results for the
intermediate 5% to 25% range notwithstanding, Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny have
provided some weak support for the shareholder interest hypothesis. More recent
support comes from a study by Straska and Waller that showed that companies with
low bargaining power can improve their position and shareholders’ potential gains by
adopting antitakeover measures.2
RIGHTS OF TARGETS’ BOARDS TO RESIST: UNITED STATES
COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
U.S. laws give the boards of directors of U.S. companies much leeway in resisting hostile
bids and taking an array of evasive actions. Under U.S. laws, boards can offer such
resistance as part of what they see as their fiduciary responsibilities. This is different
from how such actions are viewed in other regions, such as Great Britain, the Eurozone,
and Canada. In these jurisdictions the laws are more shareholder rights–oriented and
boards are more limited in the defensive actions they can take. Here the laws tend to
favor offers being made directly to shareholders and letting them decide. In the United
States the laws allow directors to exercise their own judgment about what is best
for shareholders. When boards are too close to entrenched managers, this can work
against shareholders’ interests.
Life Cycle Effects of Takeover Defenses
The value of takeover defenses often changes over the life of a firm. In the initial post-IPO
years, takeover defenses can solidify the bond between the company and important
stakeholders such as customers and suppliers. For example, Johnson, Kang, and Yi
report that 65% of IPO firms report at least one large customer.3 For smaller companies,
such relationships can be quite important. In a later study, the same researchers
analyzed a sample of 1,219 public companies over the period 1997–2005.4 They found
that valuations of companies were higher when they had more than three defenses in
place, compared to those that had fewer—but only if the company reported it had at
least one large customer.

Antitakeover Measures
Johnson, Karpoff, and Yi analyzed a sample of over 2,000 companies that went
public over the period 1997–2011.5 They found that, on average, firms had 2.42
defenses in place at the time of the IPO but that this average increased by an additional
0.67 defenses during the next 10 years. They also found that 90% of the companies in
their sample never removed any of these defenses over this time period—showing that
such defenses are “sticky.” They also noted that early in the companies’ public lives,
the implementation of takeover defenses were associated with increases in firm value,
while the opposite was the case later in a pubic company’s life. This suggests that such
defenses might outlive their value as public companies age.
PREVENTATIVE ANTITAKEOVER MEASURES
Preventative antitakeover measures have become common in corporate America. Most
Fortune 500 companies have considered and developed a plan of defense in the event
that the company becomes the target of a hostile bid. One of the key actions a potential
target can take is to enhance its preparedness. This means having a defensive strategy
already designed and a defense team selected. This includes an outside law firm, invest-
ment bankers, proxy solicitors, and a public relations firm. Ideally, this group should
meet, perhaps even once a year, and outline the strategy they will deploy in the event of
an unwanted bid. This strategy should be revisited based on changes in the M&A arena
as well as other changes, such as industry M&A trends.
The potential target will want to prepare what is sometimes referred to as a corpo-
rate profile. This document may outline the company’s potential vulnerability and will
suggest a strategy for how hostile bids may be dealt with. It will describe the relevant
corporate bylaws and charter provisions. This is a very important part of a company’s
takeoverpreparedness,astakeoverbattlescanbesurprisinglyswiftandapotentialtarget
must have its defensive strategy well thought out in advance. In fact, there are compa-
nies that assess the takeover vulnerability of public firms and market this information.
Early Warnings Systems: Monitoring Shareholding and Trading
Patterns
One of the first steps in developing a preventative antitakeover defense is to analyze the
distribution of share ownership of the company. Certain groups of shareholders, such
as employees, tend to be loyal to the company and probably will vote against a hostile
bidder. Institutional investors usually invest in the security to earn a target return and
may eagerly take advantage of favorable pricing and terms of a hostile offer. If a company
is concerned about being a target of a hostile bid, it may closely monitor the trading of its
shares. A sudden and unexpected increase in trading volume may signal the presence
of a bidder who is trying to accumulate shares before having to announce its intentions.

August 2016 working paper.

Such an announcement will usually cause the stock price to rise, so it is in a bidder’s
interest to accumulate as many shares as possible before an announcement.
At a minimum, a potential target company can be aware of a threatening investor
if the investor crosses the 5% threshold and files a Schedule 13D 10 days later. This is
really not that timely. Smaller holdings, though, may trigger the Hart-Scott-Rodino dol-
lar value reporting requirement ($80.8 million in 2017) for an even earlier warning.
However, this may not be sufficiently early for a target to be well prepared. Targets may
use services of companies such as Thompson Reuters, which provides data to companies
on who are their shareholders, in a level of detail and timeliness that goes beyond what
is in the public record. Even still, this may not be sufficient for wary targets, and they
may choose to employ the services of a proxy solicitor firm, such as DF King, Georgeson,
and Innisfree. They may be able to tell the client company that, for example, certain
specific activist investors are accumulating their shares. Another way a target may find
out is if an activist or hostile bidder simply calls the target’s CEO and indicates that they
have been accumulating the company’s shares and have certain plans that they want to
come to the firm to discuss. Ideally, the target would like some more advance information
prior to receiving that call.
Types of Preventative Antitakeover Measures
In effect, the installation of preventative measures is an exercise in wall building.
Higher and more resistant walls need to be continually designed and installed because
the raiders, and their investment banking and legal advisors, devote their energies to
designing ways of scaling these defenses. These defenses are sometimes referred to as
shark repellants.
Among the most common preventative measures are the following:
◾
Poison pills. These are securities issued by a potential target to make the firm less
valuable in the eyes of a hostile bidder. They can be an effective defense that has to
be taken seriously by any hostile bidder. In fact, they can be so effective that share-
holders’ rights activists have pressured many companies to remove them.
◾
Corporate charter amendments. The target corporation may enact various amend-
ments in its corporate charter that will make it more difficult for a hostile acquirer
to bring about a change in managerial control of the target. Some of the amend-
ments that are discussed are supermajority provisions, staggered boards, fair price
provisions, and dual capitalizations.
These are discussed more specifically in the following sections.
POISON PILLS
Poison pills were invented by the famous takeover lawyer Martin Lipton, who used them
in 1982 to defend El Paso Electric against General American Oil and again in 1983
during the Brown Foreman versus Lenox takeover contest. Brown Foreman, then the

188
◾
Antitakeover Measures
fourth largest distiller in the United States, made a bid for china producer Lenox. Brown
Foreman believed that Lenox’s stock, then trading at $60, was undervalued and offered
a rich $87 a share for each share of Lenox. Lenox’s counsel, Martin Lipton, suggested
that Lenox offer each common stockholder a dividend of preferred shares that would be
convertible into 40 shares of Brown Foreman stock if Brown Foreman took over Lenox.
These convertible shares would be an effective antitakeover device because, if converted,
they would seriously dilute the Brown family’s 60% share ownership position.
The type of poison pill Lenox used to fend off Brown Foreman is referred to as a pre-
ferred stock plan. This was a cumbersome pill, as the issuer could redeem them only after
an extended period of time, which might be in excess of 10 years. Another major disad-
vantage is that they had an immediate adverse impact on the balance sheet as analysts
often group preferred shares with debt when assessing a company’s leverage.
MartinLiptonadaptedthepoisonpillin1985byusingrightsasopposedtopreferred
stock. These rights allowed the holders to buy stock in the acquiring firm at a low price.
Such poison pills are called flip-over poison pills. These rights are distributed to share-
holders as a dividend and become activated after a triggering event. A typical triggering
event for modern poison pills is one of the following:
◾
An acquisition of a percentage, usually 10% to 20%, of the outstanding stock by any
individual, partnership, or corporation.
◾
A tender offer for 30% or more of the target corporation’s outstanding stock.
These new poison pills Lipton developed seemed formidable but they were effec-
tively overcome in the 1985 takeover of the Crown Zellerbach Corporation by the
Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. Goldsmith acquired more than 50% of
Crown Zellerbach’s shares to gain control of the company and its forest assets, which
he coveted. However, he avoided acquiring control of the target, thus avoiding the
flip-over pill Crown Zellerbach had in place. The flip-over pill was designed to prevent
100% acquisitions, which Goldsmith avoided doing by not completing the back-end
closeout transaction for the remaining shares. Ironically, the pill made it difficult
for Crown Zellerbach to seek out a white knight and its stock price suffered. This
improved Goldsmith’s bargaining position, and he was able to negotiate a favorable
total acquisition, followed by a sale of Crown Zellerbach’s assets, including the Camus
Mill, which he sold to the James River Corporation.6
Flip-over poison pills have the drawback that they are effective only if the bidder
acquires 100% of the target; they are not effective in preventing the acquisition of a
controlling but less than 100% interest in the target. This drawback was corrected
by the development of flip-in poison pills. Flip-in provisions allow holders of rights to
acquire stock in the target, as opposed to flip-over rights, which allow holders to acquire
stock in the acquirer. The flip-in rights were designed to dilute the target company
6 In 1997 James River and Fort Howard Corporations merged to form the Fort James Corporation, which then
became the largest tissue producer in the United States. In 2000 the Camus Mill was sold to Georgia Pacific
Corp.

regardless of whether the bidder merged the target into his company. They can be
effective in dealing with raiders who seek to acquire a controlling influence in a target
while not acquiring majority control. The raider does not receive the benefits of the
rights while other shareholders do. Thus, the presence of flip-in rights makes such
controlling acquisitions very expensive.
Modern poison pills typically contain both flip-over and flip-in provisions as well as
other protections, which we will discuss.
Legality of Poison Pills
In a November 1985 ruling in the Delaware Supreme Court, the court upheld the
legality of Household International’s use of a poison pill. At that time, Household
owned various businesses, including Household Finance, Von’s Grocery, and National
Car Rental. The board sought to prevent a takeover by one of its largest shareholders
and member of Household’s board—John Moran. He argued that this use of a pill was
discriminatory, as it was unfairly directed at him and his bid. However, the Delaware
Supreme Court’s position in Moran v. Household International was that the pills did not
necessarily keep bidders away; rather, they gave target corporations the opportunity to
seek higher bids.7 The Delaware court’s decision occurred in 1985—the same year as
the Unocal decision. Together, they gave companies concerned about hostile bids legal
support to use their “business judgment” to install defenses.
The Delaware court has not supported poison pills when they are used to preempt
the auction process. This was also the court’s position in the Pantry Pride bid for Revlon,
where the court found that Revlon’s use of its poison pill preempted the auction process
in favoring Forstmann Little’s offer while halting Pantry Pride’s bid.8 Similarly, in 1988,
British publisher Robert Maxwell successfully challenged the publisher Macmillan’s
poison pill defense. A Delaware court ruled that Macmillan’s poison pill defense unfairly
discriminated against Maxwell’s offer for the New York publishing firm. The court
concluded that poison pills should be used to promote an auction. In the court’s view,
Macmillan’s pill prevented an effective auction. Also in 1988, a Delaware court reached
a similar decision when it ruled that Interco’s poison pill unfairly favored Interco’s own
recapitalization plan while discriminating against the Rales tender and the offer.
In 1995, two court rulings also provided support to companies using poison pills
as a defense. In one case, Unitrin, which we will discuss later in this chapter, the court
took no issue with the target’s, Unitrin’s, use of a poison pill defense even though it had
other issues with Unitrin’s response to American General’s unwanted bid.9 In another
case, Moore Corp. Limited v. Wallace Computer Services, Inc., Wallace was able to use a poi-
son pill to thwart Moore’s offer.10 There were other relevant issues such as Wallace’s
staggered board and the apparent support by Wallace’s shareholders for the hostile bid.
Nonetheless, this decision supported the directors use of such defenses, including poi-
son pills. Some were concerned this would lead to greater management entrenchment.
7 Moran v. Household International, Inc., 500 A. 2d 1346 (Del. 1985).
8 Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc., 506 A.2d 173 (Del. 1986).
9 Unitrin v. American General Corp., 651 A. 2d 1361, 1388 (Del. 1995).
10 Moore Corp. Ltd. V. Wallace Computer Services, Inc., 898 F. Supp. 1089 (D. Del. 1995).

Antitakeover Measures
However, research by Heron and Lie showed that these decisions did not affect the use of
poison pills or the completion rate of hostile bids and the premiums associated with such
bids, thereby failing to support the view that the court rulings enhanced management
entrenchment.11
In 2014, activist hedge fund manager David Leob, and his fund, Third Point,
challenged a particularly aggressive use of a poison pill by the famed auction house
Sotheby’s. Sotheby’s adopted a poison pill that limited Loeb’s holdings to 10% before
incurring the adverse effects of the company’s poison pill defense but allowed other
passive investors to hold up to 20% without being affected by the pill. Leob sued on
the grounds that this was clearly unfair. In a ruling issued on May 2, 2014, Judge
Donald Parson ruled companies could use poison pills in this manner—a manner that
discriminated against a specific activist investor.
Trends on Poison Pill Adoptions
After the use of poison pills was upheld in the courts, large corporations rushed to adopt
their own poison pill defenses. In the 1990s, poison pill defenses were commonplace
(see Figure 5.1). During that period, most of the S&P 500 companies had poison pills in
place. In the 2000s, however, pressures were placed on companies to not renew poison
pill plans and to not adopt new ones. This helps explains the downward trend in pills
adopted starting in 2003. Now they are much less common for large companies but
are more common among smaller firms. The reason why many large companies have
backedawayfromshareholderrightsplansisduetothepressurefromshareholderrights

Poison Pills
◾
191
Instead of having a plan in place, targets may simply adopt a pill after a bid has
taken place or an activist has targeted the company. This is sometimes referred to as a
shadow pill. For large companies, this can be done in a single day at a board of directors
meeting during which the members approve the pill.12 This is a fact that bidders and
activists should be aware of when weighing a target’s defenses. Simply looking at the
number of shareholder rights plans currently adopted is very deceptive, as companies
typically have different variations of plans “on the shelf” ready to be deployed depending
on the type of threat the board perceives. This is why such plans are sometimes referred
to as “shelf plans.” With shelf plans, the boards have already discussed the plan and the
circumstances in which it might be used. No rights have yet been issued and no public
announcements have taken place.
Companies are not always free to use on-the-shelf plans. Shareholder activist
groups, such as the Institutional Shareholders Services (ISS), have pressured compa-
nies not to adopt plans longer than one year and to secure voting approval before a plan
is adopted. Shareholder approval always seems like a good idea, but it may not work
that quickly when a company is confronted by a hostile bidder or aggressive activist.
ISS also has tried to prevent companies from having pills with thresholds lower than
20%. However, potential targets might not find enough protection from pills with such
as high threshold.
Number of Poison Pill Plans in Place
As we have discussed and showed in Figure 5.1, fewer companies are adopting poi-
son pills. Therefore, it is no surprise when we see in Figure 5.2 that the number of

Antitakeover Measures
shareholder rights plans in place has also been declining. Companies are aware that
such plans can be adopted quickly if a threat appears on the horizon. This is known as
in-play adoptions.
Mechanics of Issuing Poison Pills
Poison pills are issued by distributing to common stockholders a dividend of one right for
each share of stock they own. Rights holders receive the right to purchase one share of
preferred stock of the issuer during the exercise period, which used to typically be 10
years in length, but in recent years, many plans have shorter exercise periods such as a
few years. The rights are initially redeemable by the board and trade with the common
stock but are not initially exercisable. They can be redeemed for a nominal price such as
$0.01 or $0.05. They trade with the stock and are not detachable until a distribution
date, which is a date after the board becomes aware of a triggering event. On the distri-
bution date the company distributes the rights certificates to the shareholders and the
rights may trade separately from the common stock.
Rights plans are usually authorized by the board of directors without shareholder
approval. However, shareholder rights entities have pressured companies whose boards
adopt them to secure shareholder approval within a reasonable time period, such
as a year.
Until the occurrence of the first triggering event, such as a bidder’s announcement
of intentions to purchase a given percentage, usually between 10% and 20%, of the
issuer stock (without board approval) or to make an offer for 30% of its shares, the rights
trade with the common shares and no separate rights certificates are issued. The bidder
(sometimes referred to as the “acquiring person”) does not get to enjoy the benefits of
the rights.
In Chapter 7 we discuss the issue of wolf-pack activism, where activist hedge funds
may work in concert to affect the control of a target corporation. In recent years, poi-
son pill developers have adapted their plans to adjust the trigger percentage to reflect
the combined holdings of different investors who might be working together as a group.
Newer plans also try to include provisions that address owners of derivatives who might
try to use those securities in a way that affects the control of the company.
When shareholder rights plans are adopted, they may allow for certain sharehold-
ers who already own large stakes to not be affected by the trigger percentage by being
grandfathered in. Large institutional shareholders also may be able to have exceptions
made for them.
A poison pill plan may exempt certain “qualified offers” that have certain desirable
financial characteristics, such as all-cash consideration and a minimum offer price. In
fact, shareholder activist groups like ISS have put forward various specific financial cri-
teria such qualified offers should have.
Once a triggering event occurs, the rights detach and become exercisable. At that
time, rights certificates are mailed to shareholders. However, the exercise price of these
rights is set so high that they really have no value as it would not make any sense
to exercise them. However, the second trigger occurs when the bidder closes on the
purchase of the target’s shares. The rights now convey upon the holder the right to
purchase shares at “50% off ” prices.

◾
193
As noted previously, the issuer may redeem the rights after the first trigger for a
nominal amount, such as $0.02 per right, if it decides that it is advantageous. For
example, if the issuer receives a bid that it finds desirable, the existence of the rights may
be an impediment to an advantageous deal and the issuer may want to remove them.
However, once the second trigger has occurred, the rights are no longer redeemable by
the board.13
Simple Example of Poison Pill Mechanics
Let us consider a very simplistic example of the mechanics of flip-in poison pills. Assume
that Corporation A makes a bid for Company B and the target has a poison pill. Let us
further assume that the pill has an exercise price (Pe) of $60, while the target’s stock
price (Ps) is $10. Then the number of shares that can be purchased are as follows:
Pe = $60 and Ps = $10, so the number of shares that can be purchased are
Pe∕(Ps∕2) = $60∕($10∕2) = $60∕5 = 12 shares.
It is important to note that when the board sets the exercise price, often with the
assistance of a valuation firm, it is not putting forward an appropriate transaction value
of acquisition price. It tries to consider the long-term value of the stock over the life of the
plan. Often, a range of three to five times the current value of the stock may be a norm,
but it can be higher for growth companies and lower for mature firms. So our example
is of a firm that may be more growth-oriented.
Let us also assume that there are 1,000 shares outstanding (SO) prior to the bid and
that the bidder has purchased 200 of them, so the remaining 800 shares are not in the
hands of the bidder. Then the poison pill allows each of these 800 shares to be used to
purchase 12 new shares, for a total of 9,600 shares. If all of the warrants are exercised,
then the total shares outstanding will be 1,000 + 9,600 =10,600 shares.
In this simplistic analysis, the value of the target’s equity prior to the exercise of the
warrants was $10 × 1,000 shares, or $10,000. The exercising of the warrants adds to
this equity in the amount of $60 × 800 shares or $48,000. At this point, total equity
capital is $10,000 + $48,000, or $58,000. There are 10,600 shares outstanding, so
the per share equity value is $58,000/10,600, or $5.47.
The loss of the value of the shares to the control shareholder is as follows:
($10.00 −$5.47) = 0.453, or 45.3%
The loss of the value of the shares does not fully capture the control shareholder’s
total loss. In addition to losing a significant portion of the value of its shares, the
control shareholder has also lost a very significant amount of its control in the target
company. After the warrants are exercised, we have 10,600 shares outstanding. Prior
to the exercise of the warrants, the control shareholder owned 20% of the company
(200/1,000). After the warrants are exercised, this “control” shareholder now owns
1.89% of the firm (200/10,600).

Antitakeover Measures
Poison Pills and Shareholder Approval
Directors can quickly authorize a poison pill defense without formally requesting
shareholder approval. For many years, such defenses were in place for 10 years before
they came up for renewal. In effect, they were “Not for Sale” signs on corporations.
However, shareholder rights advocates, such as Institutional Shareholders Services,
opposed such indiscriminate implementation of poison pills. They recognized that,
properly used, they can enhance shareholder value. Their concern, however, was that
they could also be used to entrench managers. Therefore, they tend to oppose pills that
are in place for more than a year without shareholders providing their approval.
A chewable pill, also known as a qualified offer provision, allows for a shareholder vote
on whether a particular takeover bid would be covered by the company’s poison pill. This
helps prevent pills from being used to entrench managers.
Another alternative is a TIDE (three-year independent director evaluation) plan.
Thisiswherethepoisonpillplancontainsaprovisionrequiringthatthecompany’sinde-
pendent directors review the plan every three years to see if it still is serving the interests
of shareholders. If they decide that the plan is no longer in shareholders’ interest, the
plan may also provide them with the ability to rescind it.
Blank Check Preferred Stock
Although a board of directors may have authority to issue rights, its ability to issue
shares is dictated by the corporate charter. For this reason, boards may amend the
articles of incorporation so as to create and reserve a certain amount of preferred stock
that can be issued in the event that the rights become exercisable.14 This prevents the
board from having to solicit shareholder approval to amend the charter to allow for
the issuance of shares to satisfy the rights. Such a request for shareholder approval
would be tantamount to a referendum on the poison pill itself. It would also mean
additional delay and uncertainty and would effectively weaken the poison pill defense.
Typically, the board has the right to determine voting, dividend, and conversion rights
of such shares.
Blank check preferred stock can also be used in conjunction with a white squire
defense. Here a board can quickly issue shares to a friendly party, such as an employee
stock ownership plan or an outside investor not interested in control. Shareholder rights
groups, such as ISS, are not supportive of blank check preferred rights if they are used
as an antitakeover defense.
Dead-Hand, Slow-Hand, and No-Hand Provisions
Poison pills can be deactivated by the target’s board of directors. Bidders can try to use
this feature to offset the poison pill by initiating a tender offer that is contingent on the
removal of the pill. The higher the premium offered, the more pressure on the board to
remove the pill defense. Dead-hand provisions give the power to redeem the poison pill
14 Arthur Fleischer Jr., and Alexander Sussman, Takeover Defense, 5th ed. (New York: Aspen, 1995), 5–105.

to the directors who were on the target’s board of directors when the pill was adopted
or who were appointed by such directors. Even if these directors are ousted, they retain
the voting power to control the pill’s redemption. Courts in several states, including
Delaware, have struck down dead-hand provisions.15 These courts concluded that such
provisions basically render proxy contests impossible while also coercing shareholders
to vote for the incumbent directors as those directors would be the only ones who could
redeem the pill.
Slow-hand provisions place a limit on the time period when only prior directors can
redeem the pill. Limitation periods are typically 180 days.16 Some states, such as Penn-
sylvania, but not Delaware, allow slow-hand provisions. No-hand provisions limit the
period for redemption to a certain time frame.
Although U.S. courts have often supported the use of poison pills when they do not
preempt the auction process, other nations that place greater emphasis on shareholder
rights have not viewed them so kindly. For example, the United Kingdom and the Euro-
pean Union have not been supportive of poison pills.
Net Operating Loss (NOL) Poison Pills
A company’s poor financial performance can actually provide value by allowing the
owner of these NOLs to offset other income in the future and lower its tax obligations.
NOLs are tax losses that can be used to offset profits two years past and up to 20
years forward. However, the IRS has placed limitations on their use in cases of stock
ownership changes. The IRS defines ownership changes as 50% or more of the shares
changing ownership over a three-year period. However, the only shareholders whom
the IRS focuses on (for this 50% change in ownership) are those who have obtained 5%
or more of the outstanding stock over a three-year period. Thus, the NOLs have a lower
share threshold.
In Selectica, Inc. v. Versata, Inc. the Delaware court applied the Unocal standard when
it concluded that it was legitimate for a company to use its pill—in this case, one that had
a low 4.99% trigger threshold—to protect its NOLs.17
This decision was interesting in that the court did not have a problem with the fact
that the value of the NOLs was not clearly established. This case was also interesting in
that it is one of the rare instances where a bidder actually triggered a pill.
As we have noted, an NOL pill typically has a lower threshold, usually 4.99%, and
it contains provisions for the event that one or more 5% shareholders increase their
position over a three-year period. The lower trigger threshold effectively means that tar-
get board approval is required in order for 5% or more shareholders to increase their
ownership.

Antitakeover Measures
Poison Pills and Proxy Fights
While a poison pill may make a hostile bid such as a tender offer prohibitively expensive
unless it is deactivated, it does not prevent a proxy contest. This creates an opportunity
for activists seeking control of the board of directors, which, in turn, can lead to deacti-
vating the poison pill. We will return to this issue later in this chapter after we discuss
classified boards.
Impact of Poison Pills on Shareholder Wealth
Several studies have examined the impact of poison pill provisions on stock prices.
Early studies, such as one by Malatesta and Walking that considered what effect the
announcement of the adoption of a poison pill had on 132 firms between 1982 and
1986, found that poison pill defense reduced shareholder wealth.18 Malatesta and
Walking found that poison pill defenses appeared to reduce stockholder wealth and
that, on average, the firms that announced poison pill defenses generated small, but
statistically significant, abnormal negative stock returns (–0.915%) during a two-day
window around the announcement date. When these firms abandoned their poison pill
plans, they showed abnormal positive returns.
Malatesta and Walking’s results provide some support for the managerial entrench-
ment hypothesis in that the firms adopting the pills tended to have below-average
financial performance. They also found that, on average, the managerial ownership
percentage was significantly less for firms that adopted poison pills compared with
industry averages. This supports the management entrenchment hypothesis. The
findings of Malatesta and Walking were supported by other early studies, such as one
by Michael Ryngaert of 380 firms that had adopted poison pill defenses between 1982
and 1986.19 Ryngaert found statistically significant stock price declines from firms
that adopted pill defenses and that were perceived as takeover targets. Ryngaert also
analyzed the impact on the target firm’s stock of legal challenges to the pill defense.
He noted negative excess stock returns in 15 of 18 promanagement court decisions
(upholding the legality of the pill) and positive excess returns in 6 of 11 proacquirer
decisions (invalidating the pill). Ryngaert’s research also touched on the effectiveness of
poison pills as an antitakeover defense. He found that hostile bids are more likely to be
defeated by firms that have a poison pill in place. Thirty-one percent of the pill-protected
firms remained independent after receiving unsolicited bids, compared with 15.78% for
a control group of non-pill-protected firms that also received unsolicited bids. Moreover,
in 51.8% of the unsolicited bids, pill-protected firms received increased bids, which
Ryngaert attributes to the presence of the pill defense. This finding is consistent with
other research, such as the Georgeson study that is discussed next.

Poison Pills

More comprehensive research by Comment and Schwert indicated that poison pills
do not necessarily harm shareholders.20 They find this is the case based on the impact
of poison pill on takeover premiums. We will discuss the impact of pills on premiums
shortly.
ORACLE HELD AT BAY BY PEOPLESOFT’S POISON
PILL
I
n June 2003, the second-largest U.S. software maker (behind Microsoft), Oracle
Corp., initiated a $7.7 billion hostile bid for rival and third-largest PeopleSoft
Inc. Both ﬁrms market “back-ofﬁce” software that is used for supply management
as well as other accounting functions. Lawrence Ellison, Oracle’s very aggressive
chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO), doggedly pursued PeopleSoft, which brandished its
powerful poison pill defense to keep Ellison at bay. The takeover battle went on
for approximately a year and a half, during which PeopleSoft was able to prevent
Oracle from completing its takeover due to the strength of its poison pill.
PeopleSoft’s board rejected Oracle’s offer as inadequate and refused to remove
the poison pill. Oracle then pursued litigation in Delaware to force PeopleSoft to
dismantle this defense. Over the course of the takeover contest, Oracle increased
its offer from an initial share offer price of $19 to $26, lowered it to $21, and then
raised it back up to $24. PeopleSoft also used a novel defense when it offered its
customers, in the event of a hostile takeover by Oracle, a rebate of up to ﬁve times
the license fee they paid for their PeopleSoft software. PeopleSoft defended this
defense by saying that the hostile bid made it difﬁcult for PeopleSoft to generate
sales: Customers were worried that if they purchased PeopleSoft software, it would
be discontinued by Oracle in the event of a takeover, as Oracle had its own compet-
ing products and no incentive to continue the rival software. Ironically, Oracle really
wanted PeopleSoft’s customer base, not its products or even many of its employees.
The takeover contest became very hostile, with the management of the com-
panies launching personal attacks against each other. PeopleSoft’s management
called Ellison the “Darth Vader” of the industry. PeopleSoft’s own board eventually
got so fed up with this way of handling the contest that it asked the company’s
CEO, Craig Conway, to step down.
The battle went on for approximately a year and a half, but eventually Peo-
pleSoft succumbed in January 2005. One week later Oracle began sending layoff
notices to thousands of PeopleSoft’s employees. While the poison pill did not help
these employees directly, PeopleSoft’s shareholders beneﬁted by the higher $10.3
billion takeover price. Employees indirectly beneﬁted as the prolonged contest
allowed many of them to make alternative employment plans.
This takeover contest featured an effective use of a poison pill defense and also
showed just how useful it can be in increasing shareholder value. However, while it
underscored the effectiveness of poison pills, it also showed that even a poison pill
will not necessarily hold off a determined bidder who is willing to pay higher and
higher prices.

Antitakeover Measures
Impact of Poison Pills on Takeover Premiums
Two often-cited studies concerning the impact of poison pills on takeover premiums
were conducted by Georgeson and Company, a large proxy solicitation firm. In a study
released in March 1988, the firm showed that companies protected by poison pills
received 69% higher premiums in takeover contests than unprotected companies.
The study compared the premiums paid to pill-protected companies with those paid
to companies without pill protection. Protected corporations in the Georgeson sample
received premiums that were 78.5% above where the company’s stock was trading
six months before the contest. Unprotected corporations received premiums that were
56.7% higher. The firm did a later study in November 1997, analyzing transactions
from 1992 to 1996. The results were similar, although the difference between premi-
ums was less. Premiums paid to pill-protected companies averaged eight percentage
points, or 26%, higher than those without pill protection. The difference was greater
for small-capitalization companies than for large-capitalization companies.
The positive impact of poison pills on takeover premiums that was found in both
Georgeson studies has also been confirmed by academic research. Comment and
Schwert also found that poison pills are associated with higher takeover premiums.21
More generally, Varaiya found that antitakeover measures were one of the determinants
of takeover premiums.22 For companies that are taken over, target shareholders may
receive higher premiums. However, in those instances where the pill prevents a takeover,
shareholders lose the opportunity to get the premium.
Poison Pills and the Auction Process
The fact that poison pills result in high takeover premiums has been supported by other
research on the relationship between poison pills and the auction process.23 One of the
reasons poison pills result in higher premiums is that they facilitate the auction pro-
cess. Bradley, Desai, and Kim have shown that auctions result in an added takeover
premium of 11.4%,24 whereas Comment and Schwert found added premiums equal
to 13%. Poison pill defenses are often circumvented when the bidder increases its bid
or makes an attractive all-cash offer. All-cash offers have been associated with 12.9%
higher premiums.25 In the face of increased prices brought about by an auction that
may have been combined with more attractive compensation, such as an all-cash offer,
target boards are often pressured to deactivate the poison pill.

Conclusion of Research on Shareholder Wealth Effects
of Poison Pills
The consensus of the research is that the implementation of poison pill defenses tends to
be associated with negative, although not large, excess returns to the target’s stock. We
must remember, however, that these studies focus on a narrow time period around the
date when the adoption of the pill plan is announced. Pill-protected firms that ultimately
are acquired may receive higher returns as a result of the pill defense. These higher pre-
miums were not reflected in this body of research, which focuses on short-term returns
around the announcement date of the poison pill defense.
Poison Puts
Poison puts are a unique variation on the poison pill theme. They involve an issuance of
bonds that contain a put option exercisable only in the event that an unfriendly takeover
occurs. A put option allows the holder to sell a particular security to another individual
or firm during a certain time period and for a specific price. The issuing firm hopes that
the holders’ cashing of the bonds, which creates large cash demands for the merged firm,
will make the takeover prospect most unattractive. If the acquiring firm can convince
bondholders, however, not to redeem their bonds, these bond sales may be avoided. In
addition, if the bonds are offered at higher than prevailing interest rates, the likelihood
of redemption will not be as high.
Corporate Boards and Poison Pills
The board of directors of a company has the power to deactivate the poison pill defense.
Therefore, if a bidder can change the target’s board, it can get around the poison pill.
So while the poison pill is a powerful defense, if the bidder believes that it can, perhaps
through activism and the proxy process, replace the target’s board, the poison pill
will look less formidable. If, however, the target can include another defense we will
discuss shortly, a staggered board, a defense that makes it more difficult to change an
entire board, then this combination can be a quite powerful defense. However, perhaps
the greatest pressure a bidder can exert on the target’s board is a high-premium,
all-cash offer.
CORPORATE CHARTER AMENDMENTS
Before discussing corporate charter amendments in detail, it is useful to differentiate
between a corporate charter and the corporation’s bylaws. The bylaws are usually
established by the board of directors, and they set forth important rules for how the
company will operate. For example, they will indicate when directors meet and when
and where the corporation’s annual shareholders’ meeting will be. They may also
specify what corporate officer and director positions exist and how directors may be
replaced. A corporate charter, sometimes also called the articles of incorporation, is a

200
◾
Antitakeover Measures
more fundamental document that sets forth the company’s purpose and the different
classes of shares it may have. Usually, a shareholder vote is required to change the
articles of incorporation. More major changes in how a company operates may have to
be set forth in the corporate charter and not the bylaws. From an M&A perspective, an
action such as staggering the board of directors, which we will discuss shortly, needs
to be in the corporate charter. In order to get it in the charter, it needs shareholder
approval. If this is not in the corporate charter prior to a hostile bid, it is unlikely
shareholders will approve it.
Changes in the corporate charter are common antitakeover devices. The extent
to which they may be implemented depends on state laws, which vary among states.
Corporate charter changes generally require shareholder approval. The majority of
antitakeover charter amendments are approved. Only in extreme cases of poor man-
agement performance do stockholders actively resist antitakeover amendments. This is
partly because management is generally much more organized in its lobbying efforts
than those shareholders who may oppose the proposed charter changes. Another
important reason that shareholders tend to approve these amendments is that the
majority of shareholders in large U.S. corporations are institutions, which have in the
past been known to side with management. Some evidence suggests that this tendency
is starting to change. Moreover, institutions as a whole are not unified in their support
of management.
Brickley, Lease, and Smith point out that certain types of institutional investors,
such as banks, insurance companies, and trusts, are more likely to vote in favor
of management’s proposals than other institutions, such as mutual funds, public
pension funds, endowments, and foundations.26 They believe that the latter category
of investors is more independent of management in that they do not generally derive
income from the lines of business controlled by management. When the charter
amendment proposal clearly reduces shareholder wealth, institutions in general are
more clearly found to be in opposition to the amendment.
The process of proxy approval of shareholder amendments is discussed in Chapter 6.
A later study by Brickley, Lease, and Smith explored the circumstances under which
managers are more constrained by the voting process.27 They found that although there
is a high rate of passage of proposals put forward by management, managers tend to
make such proposals only when they are highly likely to pass. In addition, in a study of
670 antitakeover corporate charter amendments involving 414 firms, they showed that
managersaremoreconstrainedbyvotingwhenthefollowingconditionsapply:(1)small
companies with more concentrated ownership, (2) companies that have large outside
blockholders, (3) when information about possible adverse shareholder wealth effects
has attracted media attention, and (4) companies that have stringent voting rules.
We will examine the shareholder wealth effects of the various specific types of
amendments. However, research on amendments in general points to negative effects

following their passage.28 When we explore the wealth effects of specific amendments,
we will see that they tend to differ and various factors, such as the strength of the
specific defense, tend to determine whether there are significant impacts.
Some of the more common antitakeover corporate charter changes are as follows:
◾
Staggered terms of the board of directors
◾
Supermajority provisions
◾
Fair price provisions
◾
Dual capitalizations
Staggered Board Amendments
A normal direct election process provides for each director to come up for election at the
company’s annual meeting. Shareholders may or may not have the right to call a special
meeting where directors can be elected. If shareholders, such as a hostile bidder, do not
have that right, then they have to wait for the next annual meeting. In Delaware, these
rights may be specified either in the corporate charter or in the bylaws.
However,whenaboardisstaggeredorclassified,onlyacertainpercentageor“class”
of directors, such as one-third, will come up for election during any one year, so that
each director is elected approximately once every three years.29 In all states, installing a
staggered board through amending the corporate charter requires both shareholder and
board approval, whereas installing it through the bylaws requires either shareholder or
board approval.30 To uninstall a staggered board that was put in place via the char-
ter requires the approval of both groups while a staggered board that was put in place
through the bylaws requires approval of either group.
Staggered or classified boards are a controversial antitakeover defense. While in the
early2000s,themajorityofU.S.publiccompanieshadstaggeredboards,alsocalledclas-
sified boards, the majority of companies now have declassified or unitary boards. The
staggered board defense varies the terms of the board of directors so that only a few, such
as one-third, of the directors may be elected during any given year. This may be impor-
tant in a takeover battle because the incumbent board may be made up of members who
are sympathetic to current management. Indeed, boards may also contain members of
management. When a bidder has already bought majority control, the staggered board
may prevent him from electing managers who will pursue the bidder’s goals for the cor-
poration, such as the sale of assets to pay down the debt incurred in the acquisition
process. In a proxy contest, staggered boards require insurgents to win more than one
proxy fight at two successive shareholder meetings to gain control of the target. Basi-
cally, staggered boards introduce a significant minimum delay and much uncertainty
in the hostile takeover process.

Antitakeover Measures
At first glance, a poison pill defense seems much more powerful than a staggered
board. However, without a staggered board to keep it in place, a poison pill defense could
be deactivated by a hostile bidder if it were to secure sufficient voting support. With a
staggered board in place, then, poison pill remains powerful; without it, not so much.
The power of staggered boards was underscored by Bebchuk et al. when they showed
that having a staggered board nearly doubled the likelihood that a target would remain
independent.31
The trend toward declassification of boards has partially been in response to pres-
sure by shareholder rights activists. Indeed, a significant amount of this pressure came
from the Harvard Shareholder Rights Project, which started these efforts in the 2010
proxy season. This project works with institutional investors such as pension funds to
initiate proxy proposals to pressure companies to declassify their boards. It claims that
98 boards of S&P 500 and Fortune 500 companies were declassified as a result of these
efforts during the 2012–2014 proxy seasons. However, the project has attracted more
than its share of criticism.32
Many companies have declassified their boards in response to outside pressure.
This trend is much more pronounced at larger, S&P 500 firms, than at smaller public
companies. While over half of S&P500 had classified boards in 2000, this percentage
fell to 10% by the end of 2015 (see Figure 5.3). At smaller public companies, however,
such as those in the S&P Small Cap 600, the number of firms with classified boards

is 43%. Given that larger companies, such as those in the S&P500, tend to be under
greater scrutiny, the governance concerns about smaller companies, which are less in
the public eye, can be greater.
Under Delaware law, classified directors cannot be removed before their term
expires. Nonclassified board members, however, can be removed by majority voting
from the shareholders.
Like many other corporate charter amendments, staggered boards are not a suf-
ficiently powerful defense to stop a determined bidder; rather, they are usually one of
a collection of defenses that together can make a takeover difficult and costly to com-
plete. In addition, in recent years shareholders are much more reluctant to approve a
staggered board, especially if the proposal comes after a hostile bid has been launched.
As we have noted in our discussion of poison pills, the combination of a poison pill
and a staggered board can be a powerful defensive combination since one way to deacti-
vatethepoisonpillistochangethetarget’sboardandgetanewboardwhowilleliminate
the pill. When a staggered board imposes long delays to change the board, the poison pill
defense becomes more powerful.33
A potentially less powerful staggered board is one with no limitations on the size of
the board. Here, a controlling shareholder could win an election and replace one-third of
the board but also could increase the size of the board and place his own representatives
in these new board positions. In doing so, he could have a majority of the board votes.
This is sometimes referred to as a leaky staggered board. A company’s corporate charter
should set forth the rules for how the board size is determined. If, however, this issue is
addressed only in the corporate bylaws, then a controlling shareholder may be able to
amend these bylaws to allow for the board size to increase. Potential target companies
need to make sure the corporate charter includes such rules, as well as prohibitions on
the removal of directors for any reason other than valid cause. Under Delaware law, it is
assumed that a classified board may have its board members removed only for cause if
the charter is silent on this.
Staggered Board Research
The impact of staggered boards on shareholder wealth has been the subject of research
for over 30 years. Some early studies, such as the one conducted by DeAngelo and
Rice, seemed to find some evidence of negative shareholder wealth effect. They studied
a sample of 100 different firms, of which 53 had a staggered board.34 However, their
sample included other forms of antitakeover amendments, although staggered boards
made up a significant percentage of the amendments considered. These results were
also tempered by low statistical significance. Other early research by Ruback failed to
find a statistically significant relationship between a negative stock price effect and

staggered board provisions.35 His research showed a negative 1% decline in stock prices
resulting from passage of staggered board provisions; these results were not statistically
significant.
A later study by Bhagat and Jefferis considered 344 companies that adopted
classified boards along with other defenses.36 They did not find evidence of significant
shareholder wealth effects following the adoption of several defenses, including stag-
gered boards. However, once again, this study did not exclusively focus on staggered
boards alone but rather a grouping of various different preventative antitakeover
defenses.
Research by Bebchuk and Cohen found a negative relationship between firm value,
as measured by Tobin’s q, and the implementation of a staggered board.37 They focused
on the period between 1995 and 2002. This study implies that staggered boards lower
firm values. Other recent empirical research has reached similar conclusions.38 In fact,
Olubunmi Faleye, analyzing a large sample of over 2,000 companies with classified
boards, found that companies with classified boards underperform those without such
boards and that such companies are less likely to fire their CEO for poor performance.
This research lends support to the view that classified boards entrench management.
Like much of M&A research, inconsistent evidence presents a less clear view. Cremers,
Litov, and Sepe analyzed a large dataset covering the period 1978–2011 and did indeed
find that, from a cross-sectional perspective, companies with staggered boards do
have lower values as reflected by the Tobin’s q values.39 However, from a time series
perspective, this is not the case. That is, looking at the impact of a staggered board on q
values over time, they find that adopting a staggered board increases certain companies’
q values and de-staggering lowers them. They interpret these results as reflecting a
company’s commitment to long-term values and that staggered boards may help
prevent short-term-oriented attacks on firms with a more long-term orientation—such
as those that have significant R&D investments.
Supermajority Provisions
A corporation’s charter dictates the number of voting shares needed to amend the cor-
porate charter or to approve important issues such as mergers. Other transactions that
may require stockholder approval are corporate liquidation, lease of important assets,
sale of the company, or transactions with interested parties or substantial shareholders.
The definition of a substantial shareholder may vary, but it most often means a stock-
holder with more than 5%–10% of the company’s outstanding shares.

Corporate Charter Amendments
◾
205
A supermajority provision provides for a higher-than-majority vote to approve a
merger—typically 80%, or two-thirds approval. The more extreme versions of these
provisions require a 95% majority. Supermajority provisions may be drafted to require
a higher percentage if the size of the bidder’s shareholding is larger. They are more
effective when management, or other groups that tend to be very supportive of manage-
ment on issues such as mergers, hold a sufficient amount of stock to make approval of
a merger more difficult. For example, if management and an employee stock ownership
plan (ESOP) hold 22% of the outstanding stock and the corporation’s charter requires
80% approval for mergers, it will be very difficult to complete a merger if the 22% do
not approve.
Supermajority provisions generally contain escape clauses, sometimes called board
out clauses, which allow the corporation to waive or cancel the supermajority provision.
Themostcommonescapeclauseprovidesthatthesupermajorityprovisionsdonotaffect
mergers that are approved by the board of directors or mergers with a subsidiary. Most of
these escape clauses are carefully worded so that the members of the board of directors
who are interested parties may not vote with the rest of the board on related issues. An
example of the interested party qualification would be the raider who holds 12% of a
target company’s stock, which has allowed the raider to command one or more seats on
the board of directors. The escape clause would prevent this raider from exercising his
votes on issues of approving a merger offer.
Supermajority provisions are most frequently used in conjunction with other
antitakeover corporate charter changes. Corporations commonly enact supermajority
provisions along with or after they have put other antitakeover charter amendments
into place. If the supermajority provisions require a supermajority to amend the
corporate charter, it is more difficult for a raider to erase the other antitakeover
provisions once the supermajority provision is in place. Supermajority provisions are
more effective against partial offers. Offers for 100% of the target tend to negate the
effects of most supermajority provisions. Exceptions may occur when certain groups
loyal to the target hold a percentage greater than the difference between 100% and the

Antitakeover Measures
Supermajority Provision Shareholder Wealth Effects
Early research on the shareholder wealth effects of antitakeover amendments, many of
which included supermajority provisions, found some initial negative effects around
the announcement of their implementation. DeAngelo and Rice41 and Linn and
McConnell42 both conducted studies in 1983 and failed to find significant negative
price effects for the various antitakeover amendments considered. These results are
somewhat contradicted, however, by Jarrell and Poulsen, who point out that these other
studies considered only the earlier versions of supermajority provisions, which do not
include an escape clause.43 They found that the later supermajority provisions, which
included such escape clauses, were associated with a statistically significant negative
5% return. However, those supermajority provisions without escape clauses did not
show significant negative returns.
In 1987, a study shed light on the effectiveness of classified boards and superma-
jority provisions. Pound examined two samples of 100 firms each; one group had super-
majority provisions and classified boards, whereas the control group had neither. His
results showed that the frequency of takeovers was 28% for the group with the anti-
takeover amendments in place but 38% for the nonprotected control group.44 These
findings were also supported in a study by Ambrose and Megginson, who found that
companies with supermajority amendments were insignificantly less likely to be the tar-
get of a takeover bid.45
Dual Capitalization
Dual capitalization is a restructuring of equity into two classes of stock with different
voting rights. This equity restructuring can take place only with shareholder approval.
An example of a company with such a voting structure is News Corp, in which Rupert
Murdoch and his family hold Class B shares that command 39% of the company’s voting
power. About two-thirds of the equity base of the company is Class A shares, which actu-
ally have no voting rights. From an antitakeover perspective, however, the purpose of
dual capitalization is to give greater voting power to a group of stockholders who might
be sympathetic to management’s view. Management often increases its voting power
directly in a dual capitalization by acquiring stock with greater voting rights. A typi-
cal dual capitalization involves the issuance of another class of stock that has superior
voting rights to the current outstanding stock. The stock with the superior voting rights

might have 10 or 100 votes for each share of stock. This stock is usually distributed by
the issuance of superior voting rights stock to all stockholders. Stockholders are then
given the right to exchange this stock for ordinary stock. Most stockholders choose to
exchange the supervoting rights stock for ordinary stock because the super stock usu-
ally lacks marketability or pays low dividends. However, management, who may also
be shareholders, may not exchange its supervoting rights stock for ordinary stock. This
results in management increasing its voting control of the corporation.
Why Do Dual Class Recapitalizations Get Approved?
Companies must first receive the approval of shareholders before they can create a dual
class recapitalization. It is easy to see why the shareholders of closely held companies
going public approve a dual class structure. They are trying to raise capital while pre-
serving control. For example, in 2017, Snap Inc. did an IPO where the two founders
retained 38% of the voting power while only owning 45% of the outstanding shares
after the IPO.46 In fact, new shareholders received no voting power! Such a dual class
structure is popular among tech companies seeking to raise capital while still affording
control to the founders. For example, Mark Zuckerberg controls 57.6% of Facebook’s
votes while owning 27.6% of its shares.47 One may wonder, why would shareholders in
companies that are already public approve a recapitalization that would concentrate
voting power in the hands of a small group who usually are insiders? The answer is
straightforward—shareholders seek the financial gain from the higher dividends and
may not value control that highly. Research also shows that companies that pursue
dual class recapitalizations seem to do better in some ways (not as well in others) than
another group of firms—leveraged buyout (LBO) firms, which also change their capi-
tal structure while increasing control in the hands of management. Lehn, Netter, and
Poulsen showed that, for the firms in the sample, which covered the period 1977–1987,
dual class firms spent more on capital expenditures although LBO firms showed better
financial performance.48 However, this compares companies with dual classifications
and companies that have undergone an LBO as opposed to companies that have not
done either.
There has been rising pressure from various sources against companies adopting
dual classifications of stock. In 2017 the managers of the S&P500 announced that
they would not allow new companies to join the index if they had multiple classes of
stock with varying voting rights. Pressure is also coming from large institutions which
offer index-tracking products. For example, also in 2017, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard,
and State Street Global Advisors approved a governance initiative put forward by the
Investor Stewardship Group, which supports the principle of one-share-one-vote and
opposez unequal voting rights.

Antitakeover Measures
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Dual Capitalizations
In early research Jarrell and Poulsen examined 94 firms that recapitalized with dual
classes of stock that had different voting rights between 1976 and 1987.49 Forty
of the firms were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 26 on the American
Stock Exchange and 31 traded over the counter. The study found significant abnormal
negative returns equal to 0.82% for a narrow time period around the announcement
of the dual capitalization. Jarrell and Poulsen also reported that the greatest negative
effects were observed for firms that had high concentrations of stock held by insiders
(30%–50% insider holdings). Dual capitalization will be more effective in consolidating
control in the hands of management when management already owns a significant
percentage of the firm’s stock. The fact that negative returns were higher when man-
agement already held more shares implies that when management entrenchment was
more likely (which, in turn, implies that the potential for a successful bid was lower),
the market responded by devaluing the shares.
Later research by Shum, Davidson, and Glascock found that, although the imple-
mentation of dual capitalizations may not generate significant shareholder wealth
effects, when their implementation causes the original shareholders to lose control
without receiving compensation in return, there are negative effects.50 Bacon, Cornett,
and Davidson found out that how the market reacted to dual capitalizations depended
on how many independent directors were on the board.51 When independent directors
dominated, the market response was positive. This implies that the market believes
that if a largely independent board approved the dual capitalizations, then the defense
furthered shareholders’ interests and did not entrench management. When corporate
governance is discussed in Chapter 12, we will see that shareholder wealth is enhanced
when boards are dominated by independent directors.
More recent research has not cast dual classifications in a favorable light. As we
will also discuss in Chapter 13, Masulis, Wang, and Xie analyzed a large sample of 503
dual class companies over the period 1995–2003. They found that the greater the diver-
gence between insider voting rights and cash flow rights, the more likely shareholder
wealth will decline.52 In addition, as this divergence increases, CEO compensation rises
and the propensity to pursue value-destroying M&As grows. They also found that the
productivity of capital investments was less at dual classification. This led them to reach
the intuitive result that dual classification facilitates management entrenchment and
enables managers to engage in empire-building and value-destroying M&As.

Corporate Charter Amendments
◾
209
Fair Price Provisions
A fair price provision is a modification of a corporation’s charter that requires the
acquirer to pay minority shareholders at least a fair market price for the company’s
stock. This may be stated in the form of a certain price or in terms of the com-
pany’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio. That is, it may be expressed as a multiple of the
company’s earnings per share. The P/E multiple chosen is usually derived from
the firm’s historical P/E ratio or is based on a combination of the firm’s and the
industry’s P/E ratio. Fair price provisions are usually activated when a bidder makes an
offer. When the fair price provision is expressed in terms of a specific price, it usually
states that stockholders must receive at least the maximum price paid by the acquirer
when he or she bought the holdings.
Many state corporation laws already include fair price provisions. As we have noted
in Chapter 3, research by Cain, McKeon, and Solomon implies that such laws can have
a more significant impact on shareholder wealth than other state antitakeover laws
such as business combination statutes.53 Fair price amendments to a corporation’s
charter augment the fair price provisions of the state’s laws. In states in which fair
price provisions exist, corporate fair price provisions usually provide for higher prices
for stockholders in merger offers. The target corporation may waive most fair price
provisions.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Fair Price Provisions
Research on the impact of fair price provisions on stockholder wealth has thus far failed
to show a significant relationship between fair price amendments and stock prices.
Jarrell and Poulsen reported a small but statistically insignificant (negative) −0.65%
change in stock prices in response to the implementation of fair price amendments.54
This means that although they found the expected sign (negative), their results were
not sufficiently robust to state confidently that there is any relationship between the
fair price provisions and stock prices.
Antigreenmail Provisions
Antigreenmail charter amendments restrict the ability of a target corporation to pay
greenmail to a potential hostile bidder. Some amendments allow the payment if share-
holders extend their approval. Other variations allow for the payment of some ceiling
amount,suchasthemarketprice.Inthecaseofatakeoverbattle,whichgenerallycauses

Greenmail is discussed later in this chapter with active antitakeover defenses.

Antitakeover Measures
Restrictions on Ability to Call an Election
Unless there are specific restrictions in the corporate charter, most states require
corporations to call a special shareholder meeting if a certain percentage of the share-
holders request it. Such meetings may be used as a forum whereby insurgents try to
gain control of the company. At shareholder meetings, takeover defenses such as poison
pills may be dismantled. These meetings may also be used to promote proxy fights.
Given the opportunities for bidders that shareholder meetings present, companies may
try to amend the charter to limit the ability to call meetings. Some of the more extreme
restrictions limit the ability to call a meeting to the board of directors or only if a certain
high percentage of the shareholders request it. In addition, there may be limitations
imposed on the types of issues that may be raised at the shareholder meeting.
Antitakeover Amendments and Takeover Probability
and Premiums
Various studies have shown that, at a minimum, antitakeover amendments delay
a takeover, perhaps enough to enable management to secure a better offer, or they
may prevent a takeover altogether.55 Cunat, Gine, and Guadalupe analyzed a data
set of all proposals to remove an antitakeover provision at annual meetings of S&P
1500 companies over the period 1994–2013.56 They found that votes to remove such
provisions increased the probability of takeover within five years by 4.5% and that for
those firms that were taken over their premiums were 2.8% higher. These are very
intuitive results.
CHANGING THE STATE OF INCORPORATION
Because different U.S. states have antitakeover laws that vary in degrees of protection,
a company may choose to relocate its legal corporate home so it is protected by another
state’s laws that have stronger antitakeover provisions. This is usually accomplished by
a company creating a subsidiary in the new state and then merging the parent into
the subsidiary. Reincorporating in another state that has stronger antitakeover laws,
however, will not ensure a firm’s independence. For example, Singer moved its state of
incorporation from Connecticut to New Jersey, a state that has a strong antitakeover
law. The move did not prevent Singer from ultimately being taken over by raider Paul
Bilzerian in 1988. Nonetheless, reincorporating may make a takeover more difficult for
the raider. This stronger bargaining position may help the target get a better price for
the shareholders.

Shareholder Wealth Effects of Reincorporation
Netter and Poulsen examined the shareholder wealth effects of reincorporation
announcements for 36 firms in 1986 and 1987.57 They divided their sample into two
groups: 19 firms that reincorporated from California and the remaining 17 firms. They
point out that California is a shareholder rights state whose corporation laws protect
shareholder interests. Among the rights provided are mandatory cumulative voting, a
prohibition against classified boards, and other shareholder rights, such as the ability to
remove directors without cause or to call special meetings. Netter and Poulsen reasoned
that if there were stock price effects, they would be greater in reincorporations from
California to Delaware. Their results failed to reveal any shareholder wealth effects
either from the 36 reincorporations in their sample or from the California subsample.
On the basis of their study, we may conclude that the greater flexibility provided to
management by incorporating in Delaware will not reduce shareholder wealth.
ACTIVE ANTITAKEOVER DEFENSES
Installing the various preventative antitakeover defenses will not guarantee a com-
pany’s independence. It may, however, make the takeover more difficult and costly. Some
bidders may decide to bypass a well-defended target in favor of other firms that have not
installed formidable defenses. Nonetheless, even those firms that have deployed a wide
array of preventative antitakeover defenses may still need to actively resist raiders when
they become targets of a hostile bid. The second half of this chapter describes some of
the various actions a target may take after it receives an unwanted bid or learns that it
is about to be the target of such a bid. The target may become aware of this in several
ways, such as through the results of its stock watch or market surveillance programs or
through required public filings, such as a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing.
The following actions are discussed in the second half of this chapter:
◾
Greenmail. Share repurchases of the bidder’s stock at a premium (not really in use
in recent years).
◾
Standstill agreements. These agreements usually accompany a greenmail payment.
Here the bidder agrees not to buy additional shares in exchange for a fee.
◾
White knights and white squires. The target may seek a friendly bidder, or white
knight, as an alternative to the hostile acquirer. Alternatively, the target may place
shares or assets in the hands of a friendly firm or investor, a white squire. Targets
can use lockup options, topping fees, or bust-up fees as incentives to entice white
knights or white squires to step in.
◾
Capital structure changes. Targets may take various actions that will alter the com-
pany’s capital structure. Through a recapitalization, the firm can assume more debt

debt without using the proceeds to pay shareholders a dividend. Both alternatives
make the firm more heavily leveraged and less valuable to the bidder. Targets may
also alter the capital structure by changing the total number of shares outstanding.
This may be done through a new offering of stock, placement of shares in the hands
of a white squire, or an ESOP. Instead of issuing more shares, some targets buy back
shares to ensure they are not purchased by the hostile bidder.
◾
Litigation. Targets commonly sue the bidder, and the bidder often responds with a
countersuit. It is unusual to see a takeover battle that does not feature litigation as
one of the tools used by either side.
◾
Pac-Man defense. One of the more extreme defenses occurs when the target makes
a counteroffer for the bidder. This is one of the more colorful takeover defenses,
although it is seldom used.
◾
Just-say-no defense. The target simply refuses to accept a takeover bid and will not
deactivate any defenses or even take the offer to shareholders.
The coverage of these active antitakeover defenses is similar to the coverage of the
preventative measures. The use of each action is described, along with the research on
its shareholder wealth effects. Bear in mind that a target may choose to use several of
these defenses together as opposed to selecting merely one. It is difficult, therefore, for
research studies to isolate the shareholder wealth effects of any specific defense. In addi-
tion, some of the research, using different datasets drawn from different time periods
withvaryingmarketconditions,reachesconflictingconclusions.Asthemarketchanges
and adapts to the various defenses, their effectiveness—and therefore their impact on
stock prices—also varies. These problems were also apparent in the research studies on
the preventative measures.
Greenmail
In the 1980s, it was not unusual for a bidder to accumulate a share position in a
target so as to threaten it in the hopes that the target would repurchase its shares at
a premium. Paying greenmail became a controversial active antitakeover defense that
was upheld by various court rulings. However, for a variety of reasons, greenmail has
become uncommon. Federal tax laws imposed a 50% tax penalty on gains derived
from greenmail payments. Under this law, greenmail is defined as consideration paid
to anyone who makes or threatens to make a tender offer for a public corporation. In
order for the payment to be considered greenmail, the offer must not be available to all
shareholders. Companies have adopted antigreenmail amendments to their corporate
charters that limit the company’s ability to pay greenmail. Combined, these changes
have rendered greenmail interesting from a historical perspective but less relevant to
the current world of M&A.
Evolution of the Greenmailer
We really do not have greenmail like we had in the fourth merger wave, as the
greenmailer has evolved into a new form of activist shareholder and is practicing his
art somewhat differently. We now have hedge funds, which assume significant stock
positions in corporations and, instead of seeking to be bought out at a premium lest

they launch a hostile takeover, these activist investors are taking a different tack in the
2000s. Rather than demand greenmail, raiders-turned-activist hedge fund managers,
such as Carl Icahn, demand changes that will increase the value of their, and other
shareholders, equity holdings. We discuss this phenomenon in detail in Chapter 7.
Standstill Agreements
A standstill agreement occurs when the target corporation reaches a contractual agree-
ment with a potential acquirer whereby the would-be acquirer agrees not to increase
its holdings in the target during a particular time period. This has been found to be
legal under Delaware law.58 Such an agreement takes place when the acquiring firm
has established sufficient stockholdings to be able to pose a threat to mount a takeover
battle for the target. Many standstill agreements are accompanied by the target’s agree-
ment to give the acquirer the right of first refusal in the event that the acquirer decides
to sell the shares it currently owns. This agreement is designed to prevent these shares
from falling into the hands of another bidder who would force the target to pay them
standstill compensation or, even worse, attempt to take over the target. Another version
of a standstill agreement occurs when the acquirer agrees not to increase its holdings
beyond a certain percentage. In other words, the target establishes a ceiling above which
the acquirer may not increase its holdings. The acquiring firm agrees to these various
restrictions for a fee. Like greenmail, standstill agreements may provide compensation
for an acquirer not to threaten to take control of the target. In fact, standstill agreements
often accompany greenmail. However, while greenmail is not normally a part of the cur-
rent M&A world, standstill agreements are often featured in normal M&A negotiations.
In fact, it is often the case when two potential merger partners enter into a nondisclo-
sure agreement (NDA) they often also enter into a standstill agreement that provides
some assurance that the information exchanged will not be used to further a hostile bid
if friendly negotiations fall apart.
Standstill agreements usually have a time limit on them, such as one year. In that
case, the control shareholder agrees not to increase his holdings and/or make a bid for a
year. It is usually the case, though, that the control shareholder can privately approach
the target and ask if it would be acceptable to make a bid for the company—perhaps at
more attractive terms than what the shareholder first had in mind at the time he entered
into the standstill. Courts would look negatively at the bidder if he chose to go public with
his offer in violation of the standstill agreement, as then the “cat is out of the bag” and
the company might thereby be put in play by a bidder who agreed to a standstill.
The stock purchases threshold is usually less than 5% and often is 2% to 3%. The
5% ceiling is due to the Williams Act disclosure requirements, which may require the
potential buyer to indicate its interest in buying the target. This disclosure may then put
the company in play, which the target may want to avoid.
The parties to a standstill agreement may agree on a fall-away clause, which essen-
tially says that if another party makes a bid or the company is put in play, then the initial
party who agreed to the standstill can be released from it.

Antitakeover Measures
Don’t Ask, Don’t Waive Standstills
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Waive” standstill agreements include the typical provision of tradi-
tional standstill agreements but also include a provision that prohibits the potential
bidder from submitting even a private proposal to the board.
Boards may even be prohibited by such agreements from seeking information on
bids outside of the auction process. These are sometimes referred to as “No Talk” provi-
sions. Such agreements state that the bidder may not ask, even privately, for the board
to waive the standstill.
This may seem to be not in the interests of target shareholders, but some courts,
including Delaware, have recognized that there are benefits to shareholders when
boards can control a bidding process in furtherance of the Revlon duties. Boards want
bids submitted as part of that auction process and not one at a time in a piecemeal
fashion.
In spite of courts, including Delaware, being enamored with the Revlon auction
process, they have also recognized that Don’t Ask, Don’t Waive and No Talk provisions
may leave the target’s board in an informational vacuum, which may not be in the
interest of its shareholders. The Delaware Chancery Court in Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Cyprus
Amax Minerals Company found the No Talk provision of a merger agreement is not in
shareholders’ interests.59 In addition, in the Complete Genomics case, Vice Chancellor
J. Travis Laster found the Don’t Ask, Don’t Waive portion of the merger agreement
between BGI-Shenzhen and Complete Genomics Inc. to be problematic and chose
not to enforce it, although he found the rest of the standstill agreement acceptable.60
However, as reflected by Chancellor Strine’s position on the In Re Ancestry.com case,
there is no per se rule against such provisions in Delaware.61
One of the problems with restrictions such as Don’t Ask, Don’t Waive agreements is
if they are focused on one bidder and serve to impede, rather than facilitate, the bidding
process. If this is the case, courts will have problems with them.
White Knights and White Squires
Sometimes,corporationsenlisthelpfromanothercompanytofightoffahostiletakeover.
The track record of these “solutions” is mixed.
Seeking White Knights
When a corporation is the target of an unwanted bid or the threat of a bid from a poten-
tial acquirer, it may seek the aid of a white knight—that is, another company that would
be a more acceptable suitor for the target. The white knight will then make an offer to
buy all or part of the target company on more favorable terms than those of the original
bidder. These favorable terms may be a higher price, but management may also look for
a white knight that will promise not to disassemble the target or lay off management or
other employees. It is sometimes difficult to find a willing bidder who will agree to such

restrictive terms. The target often has to bargain for the best deal possible to stay out
of the first bidder’s hands. The incumbent managers of the target maintain control by
reaching an agreement with the white knight to allow them to retain their current posi-
tions. They may also do so by selling the white knight certain assets and keeping control
of the remainder of the target. A target company may find a white knight through its
own industry contacts or through the assistance of an investment banker who will sur-
vey potential suitors. The potential white knight might request favorable terms or other
consideration as an inducement to enter the fray. However, if this consideration is given
only to the white knight and not to the hostile bidder, and if it is so significant an advan-
tage that it could cause the hostile bidder to withdraw, the deal with the white knight
may be a violation of the target’s Revlon duties.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of White Knight Bids
Research results show that white knight bids are often not in the best interests of bid-
ding firm shareholders. One study of 100 white knights over a 10-year period between
1978 and 1987 showed that white knight shareholders incurred losses in shareholder
wealth.62 These results are consistent with prior research. The explanation for these
negative shareholder wealth effects is that such bids are not part of a planned strategic
acquisition and do not yield net benefits for the acquiring firm’s shareholders. In addi-
tion, the white knights are bidders in a contested auction environment, where prices
tend to be higher than nonauction acquisitions.
Research has shown that competition has a negative effect on shareholder wealth
of bidding firms.63 This negative effect is even greater for subsequent bidders.

made a bid for the Cities Service Oil Company. Although not part of the Seven
Sisters, the seven largest oil companies in the United States at that time, Cities
Service was approximately 20 times as large as Mesa Petroleum. Mesa had been
carrying an investment in Cities Service since 1979 and had chosen this time to
make a bid for the larger oil company. Pickens thought that Cities Service possessed
valuable assets but was badly managed. Cities Service is a case study of what was
wrong with Big Oil’s management. Based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Cities Service was a

barrels of oil and 3.1 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, it had been depleting its
gas reserves for at least 10 years. Although it had leases on 10 million acres, it was
ﬁnding practically no new oil and gas. Cities Service’s problems were hidden by its
cash ﬂow, which continued in tandem with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) price increases. The stock, however, reﬂecting management’s
record, sold at approximately a third of the value of its underlying assets. The
management did not understand the problem or did not care; either condition
is terminal.a
Mesa Petroleum made a $50-per-share bid for Cities Service. Cities Service
responded with a Pac-Man defense in which it made a $17-per-share bid for the
smaller Mesa Petroleum. The Cities Service offer was not a serious one because
Mesa’s stock had been trading at $16.75 before the Cities offer, which therefore
did not contain a premium. Cities Service asked Gulf Oil to be its white knight.
Pickens, a critic of the major oil companies, was equally critical of Gulf Oil. Gulf
made a $63-per-share bid for Cities Service. Cities saw Gulf as a similar type of oil
company, and one that would be much friendlier to Cities management than Mesa.
At that time Gulf was the third-largest oil company in the United States. Cities
accepted Gulf’s bid. Mesa ended up selling its shares back to Cities for $55 per
share, which resulted in an $11-per-share proﬁt for Mesa, or a total of $40 million.
However, Gulf had second thoughts about the Cities acquisition: Gulf would have
taken on a signiﬁcant amount of debt if it had gone through with the merger. In
addition, Gulf was concerned that the Federal Trade Commission might challenge
the merger on antitrust grounds. Much to Cities Service’s surprise and chagrin, Gulf
dropped its offer for Cities. Cities Service stock dropped to $30 a share following
the announcement of Gulf’s pullout. Cities Service management was highly critical
of Gulf and stated that its action was reprehensible. Cities Service then had to look
for another white knight. Occidental Petroleum, led by the well-known Armand
Hammer, made an initial offer of $50 per share in cash for the ﬁrst 49% of Cities
stock and securities of somewhat uncertain value for the remaining shares. Cities
rejected this bid as inadequate, and Occidental upped its offer to $55 in cash for
the front end and better-quality securities for the back end. Cities Service then
agreed to sell out to its second white knight.

White Squire Defense
The white squire defense is similar to the white knight defense. In the white squire
defense, however, the target company seeks to implement a strategy that will preserve
the target company’s independence. A white squire is a firm that consents to purchase
a large block of the target company’s stock. The stock selected often is convertible pre-
ferred stock. The convertible preferred shares may be already approved through a blank
check preferred stock amendment of the company’s charter. The target may need to
receive the approval of shareholders even if the shares are blank check preferred stock.

Active Antitakeover Defenses
◾
217
The New York Stock Exchange, for example, requires that shareholder approval be
received if such shares are issued to officers or directors or if the number issued equals
20% of the company’s shares outstanding. The white squire is typically not interested
in acquiring control of the target. From the target’s viewpoint, the appeal is that a large
amount of the voting stock in the target will be placed in the hands of a company or
investor who will not sell out to a hostile bidder. The deal may be structured so that the
shares given to the white squire may not be tendered to the hostile bidder. Sometimes,
however, a potential white squire is given incentives to go ahead with the transaction,
such as a seat on the board. Other possible incentives could be a favorable price on the
shares or a promise of generous dividends. In an effort to insure that the white squire
does not become hostile, the white squire may have to agree in advance to vote with the
target and not against it.
A classic example of a white squire defense was Carter Hawley Hale’s (CHH’s) sale of
convertible preferred stock to the General Cinema Corporation in 1984. The stock sold
to General Cinema had voting power equal to 22% of CHH’s outstanding votes. CHH
believed this was necessary to prevent a takeover by the Limited Corporation in 1984.
CHH accompanied this white squire defense with a stock repurchase program that
increased the voting power of General Cinema’s stock to 33% of CHH’s voting shares.
Merger Agreement Provisions
Targets may seek to enter into agreements with friendly parties, such as white knights,
that provide these parties with certain benefits that give them an incentive to participate
in the merger process. These incentives, which may come in the form of lockup options,
topping fees, or bust-up fees, may work to the target’s benefit by making a takeover by a
hostile bidder more difficult and expensive.
Lockup Transactions
A lockup transaction is similar to a white squire defense. In the case of lockups, the target
is selling assets to another party instead of stock. Sometimes the term lockup transaction
is also used more generally to refer to the sale of assets as well as the sale of stock to a
friendly third party. In a lockup transaction, the target company sells assets to a third
party and thus tries to make the target less attractive to the bidder. The target often sells
those assets it judges the acquirer wants most. This may also come in the form of lockup
options, which are options to buy certain assets or stock in the event of a change in con-
trol. These options may be written so that they become effective even if a bidder acquires
less than 51% of the target.
In some instances, lockup options have been held to be invalid. The court’s posi-
tion has been that, in limiting the desirability of the target to the original bidder, lockup
options may effectively preempt the bargaining process that might result during the
20-day waiting period for tender offers required by the Williams Act. An example of such
an invalid option was Marathon Oil’s option that it gave to U.S. Steel in 1981 to buy its
Yates Oil Field at a fixed price in an attempt to avoid a takeover by Mobil Oil Corporation.
This option would be exercisable in the event that Marathon was taken over. It would

218

have an important impact on future bidding contests because it was one of Marathon’s
most valued assets. The court invalidated this option on the grounds that it violated the
spirit of the Williams Act. An appeals court later affirmed this ruling. U.S. Steel ended up
acquiring Marathon Oil when Mobil’s bid was stopped on antitrust grounds.
In 1994, the Delaware Supreme Court invalidated Viacom’s lockup option to pur-
chase 24 million shares of Paramount Communications treasury stock at a negotiated,
preacquisition price if QVC acquired Paramount.64 The option would have enabled Via-
com to sell the shares to QVC, thereby increasing QVC’s price.
REVLON VERSUS PANTRY PRIDE
I
n 1985, Ronald Perelman, chief executive ofﬁcer of Pantry Pride, made an offer
for Revlon Inc. MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings, the parent company of Pantry
Pride, had built a diversiﬁed company with acquisitions between 1978 and 1984
that included a jewelry company, a cigar company, a candy manufacturer, and
Pantry Pride—the supermarket chain. Charles Revson had built Revlon into one of
the nation’s largest cosmetics companies. Revson’s successor, Michael Bergerac, a
former head of the conglomerate ITT and protégé of Harold Geneen, expanded
Revlon considerably through large acquisitions in the health-care ﬁeld. In terms of
its revenues, Bergerac’s Revlon was more of a health-care company than a cosmet-
ics company. In terms of assets, Revlon was approximately ﬁve times the size of
Pantry Pride.
Revlon’s acquisition strategy had not fared well for Bergerac, and Revlon’s
earnings had been declining. Perelman decided to make a bid for Revlon, his goal
being to sell off the health-care components and keep the well-known cosmetics
business. Pantry Pride made a cash tender of $53 a share. It ﬁnanced its offer for
the signiﬁcantly larger Revlon by borrowing $2.1 billion. Revlon’s board of directors
had approved a leveraged buyout (LBO) plan by Forstmann Little at $56 cash per
share. When Pantry Pride increased its offer to $56.25, Revlon was able to get
Forstmann Little to increase its offer to $57.25 by giving Forstmann Little a lockup
option to purchase two Revlon divisions for $525 million. This was reported by
Revlon’s investment banker to be $75 million below these divisions’ actual value.a
This option would be activated if a bidder acquired 40% of Revlon’s shares.
Delaware’s Chancery Court ruled that in agreeing to this lockup agreement,
the board of directors had breached its ﬁduciary responsibility. The court believed
that this option effectively ended the bidding process and gave an unfair advan-
tage to Forstmann Little’s LBO. However, in its ruling, the court did not declare
lockup options illegal. It stated that the options may play a constructive role in the
bargaining process and thus increase bids and shareholder wealth.
a Dennis Block, Nancy Barton, and Stephen Radin, Business Judgment Rule (Englewood Cliffs,
NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1988), 101.
The prevailing wisdom is that lockup options are used by management to entrench
themselves. This surely is the case in some instances. However, in a study of 2,067

deals over the period from 1988 to 1995, of which 8% had lockup options, Birch
found that announcement returns for targets were higher when lockup options were
present, whereas acquirer returns were lower.65 This implies that, on average, target
shareholders may benefit from such arrangements.
Although the J. P. Stevens and West Point–Pepperell decision outlined the legally
legitimate uses of lockup agreements, a subsequent decision in the Delaware Supreme
Court further underscored the illegitimate uses of these agreements. The court ruled
that a lockup agreement between Macmillan Inc. and Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts (KKR),
which allowed KKR to buy certain valuable Macmillan assets even if the agreement
between KKR and Macmillan fell through, was merely designed to end the auction
process and to preempt bidding, which would maximize the value of stockholder wealth.
The court stated that a lockup could be used only if it maximized stockholder wealth. In
this case, the lockup was used to drive away an unwanted suitor, Maxwell Communi-
cations Corporation. The court’s position remains that a lockup may be used only to
promote, not inhibit, the auction process.66
Termination, Breakup, and Topping Fees
Termination or breakup fees as well as topping fees can occur when a target agrees to
compensate a bidder if the target company is taken over by a company other than the
initial bidder. These fees, which typically range between 2% and 3% of purchase price,
may help compensate the bidder for its deal costs in case the transaction falls through.
Sometimes they are used to encourage a bidder who may be reluctant to engage in a
costly bidding process with an uncertain outcome. They are somewhat of a disincen-
tive for a raider because they are liabilities of the target and, therefore, are a cost that
will have to be assumed if its takeover is successful. That is why we discuss them in this
chapter,althoughtheyreallyshouldnotbeconsideredantitakeoverdefensesinthesense
of other formidable defenses, such as poison pills. The fact that termination fees are a dis-
incentive to the bidding process is the reason that when they are set too high, say over
5%, courts do not view them favorably as they become too preclusive.
The largest termination fee of all time was the $4 billion paid by AT&T in 2011
in connection with its failed acquisition of T-Mobile.67 The deal failed when antitrust
authorities opposed the deal. Given the concentrated nature of the mobile phone indus-
try, and all the expensive advisors and managers AT&T had working for it, it is amazing
that AT&T once again blundered in its M&As.68
Termination fees have become quite common. In the fourth merger wave, termi-
nation fees were relatively uncommon. However, by the late 1990s, two-thirds of the

M&A bids featured termination fee clauses.69 One view of these fees is that they deter
bids and therefore help entrench managers. Another view is that they give the target
leverage that allows it to extract higher bids from acquirers. Micah Officer analyzed a
sample of 2,511 merger bids and tender offers over the period 1988 to 2000. He found
an average termination fee of just $35.24 million, although the median was just $8 mil-
lion.70 The mean termination fee was 5.87% of the equity being acquired. He found an
average increased premium of 4% when the bids featured termination fees. The find-
ing of higher premiums was supported by a study by Bates and Lemmon, who analyzed
a sample of 3,307 deals and found that takeover premiums for firms with termination
fees were 3.1% higher.71 They also found that bids with termination fee clauses had a
higher probability of completion.
For deals in which the bidder’s advisors, such as investment banks and law firms,
may be retained on a success-oriented basis, they may contract with the bidder to receive
some part of the termination fee if the deal does not go through.
Termination fees can be a source of capital to finance an expansion strategy.
In 2015, the Irish drug company Shire received a $1.6 billion termination fee from
AbbVie as a result of the fact that AbbVie canceled its tax inversion–motivated merger
with Shire when the United States changed the rules on the treatment of such deals.
Shire then used the termination fee to help finance a $5.2 billion acquisition of
New Jersey–based NPS Pharmaceuticals.
Reverse termination fees allow the buyer to walk away from a deal after a merger
agreement has been reached through the payment of a fee to the seller. These clauses
becamepopularin2005,mainlyforprivateequitydeals,astheyenhancedthefinancing
out clause, which would allow the private equity buyer to walk away if it could not get
the necessary financing. This was the case in 2007 when private equity firm Cerberus
agreed to pay a reverse termination fee to United Rentals (but only after an intense legal
battle). Reverse termination fees are usually between 3% and 5% of the deal’s value.
Termination Fees and the Bidding Process
One view of termination fees is that they may inhibit the takeover process and limit
auction, thereby entrenching management. Another view is that such fees are a nor-
mal part of the successful takeover process and do not really limit legitimate bidders. In
analyzing the bidding process, Boone and Mulherin point out that only part of the pro-
cess is public—the part that follows a public announcement.72 However, this is often
preceded by a nonpublic process that features bidding by potentially more than one bid-
der. Thus, prior research based on public auctions reflects only part of the whole process.
As Figure 5.4 shows, the private component may start with initial discussions that are

followed by the signing of confidentiality and standstill agreements. Negotiations will
follow, and they, in turn, are often followed by the signing of a termination agreement.
Somewhere around this time is a public announcement that may give rise to other bid-
ders and possibly an auction. The auction, however, will reflect only part of the bidding
for the company. Boone and Mulherin confirmed this in an analysis of takeovers over the
years 1989–1999. They analyzed SEC filings of companies that were taken over, which
revealed the presence of other bids prior to any termination fee agreements.
No-Shop and Go-Shop Provisions
No-shop provisions are agreements that may be part of an overall acquisition agreement
or letter of intent in which the seller agrees not to solicit or enter into negotiations to sell
to other buyers. Targets may try to reach such an agreement with a white knight and
use the existence of the no-shop provision as the reason they cannot negotiate with a
hostile bidder.
This was done by Paramount Communications when it was trying to avoid a hostile
takeover by QVC. As in this case, the courts tend to not look kindly on these provisions
because they often have the effect of inhibiting the auction process. Although the court
was highly critical of the no-shop provision in the Paramount-QVC takeover contest, it
is not illegal under Delaware law.
In order to reduce the probability of a lawsuit from shareholders who may oppose
a deal, sometimes merger agreements contain go-shop provisions. These provisions
require a target who may want to accept an overture from a bidder to also attempt to
seek a better offer. After such legitimate attempts to do so, the merger partners are in a
better position to defend the terms of their deal to target shareholders.
One criticism of go-shop provisions is that they often allow only a relatively short
window for the target to find a better deal. For example, in 2014 Media General reached
an agreement to acquire LIN Media for $1.6 billion in cash and stock. The merger
agreement provided for a one-month go-shop period wherein LIN Media would open its
books to qualified potential buyers to see if it could achieve a better deal. If a new buyer
emerged, then the agreement provided for that buyer to pay a 1.625% breakup fee on
the $1.6 billion, which equated to $26 million. Defendants of a short period such as
one month say it is difficult to suspend the operations of two companies for longer than

that while they await the outcome of the merger. In addition, in a narrow industry such
as the TV media business of Media General and LIN, there is a limited number of buyers
who, presumably, all know the industry and the parties involved.
Capital Structure Changes
A target corporation may initiate various changes in its capital structure in an attempt
to ward off a hostile bidder. These defensive capital structure changes are used in four
main ways:
1. Recapitalize
2. Assume more debt:

Bonds
b.
Bank loan
3. Issue more shares:

Recapitalize
In the late 1980s, recapitalization became a more popular, albeit drastic, antitakeover
defense. After a recapitalization, the corporation is in dramatically different financial
condition than it was before it. A recapitalization plan often involves paying a superdiv-
idend to stockholders, which is usually financed through assumption of considerable
debt. For this reason, these plans are sometimes known as leveraged recapitalizations.
When a company is recapitalized, it substitutes most of its equity for debt while pay-
ing stockholders a large dividend. In addition to the stock dividend, stockholders may
receive a stock certificate called a stub, which represents their new share of ownership
in the company.
In a recapitalization, total financial leverage usually rises dramatically. Studies
have shown that, on average, total debt to total capitalization ratios increase from 20%
to 70%.73
Recapitalization as an antitakeover defense was pioneered in 1985 by the Mul-
timedia Corporation with the assistance of the investment bank of Goldman Sachs.
Multimedia, a Greenville, South Carolina, broadcasting company, initiated a recapital-
ization plan after the original founding family members received unsolicited bids for
the company in response to their LBO offer. In addition to a cash payout, Multimedia

Financial Management 20 (Autumn 1991): 38–68.

stockholders saw the value of their stub increase from an original value of $8.31 to
$52.25 within two years.74 The success of the Multimedia deal led to several other
recapitalizations, such as FMC Corp., Colt Industries, and Owens Corning, several of
which were completed in the following two years.
One attraction of a recapitalization plan is that it allows a corporation to act as its
own white knight. Many companies in similar situations would either seek an outside
entity to serve as a white knight or attempt an LBO. The recapitalization plan is an
alternative to both. In addition, the large increase in the company’s debt makes the
firm less attractive to subsequent bidders. A recapitalization may defeat a hostile bid
because stockholders receive a value for their shares that usually is significantly in
excess of historical stock prices. This amount is designed to be superior to the offer from
the hostile bidder.
Another feature of recapitalization that is most attractive to the target company’s
management is that it may give management a greater voting control in the target fol-
lowing the recapitalization. The target company may issue several shares of common
stock to an ESOP.75 It may also create other security options that may give manage-
ment enhanced voting power. Other stockholders, however, will receive only one share
in the recapitalized company (the stub) as well as whatever combination of debt and
cash has been offered. The company is required to make sure that all nonmanagement
stockholders receive at least a comparable monetary value for their common stockhold-
ings as did management. After the recapitalization, the concentration of shares in the
hands of insiders tends to significantly increase.
Many recapitalizations require stockholder approval before they can be imple-
mented, depending on the prevailing state laws and the corporation’s own charter.
When presenting a recapitalization plan to stockholders, corporations often seek
approval for a variety of other antitakeover measures that are proposed as part of a joint
antitakeover plan. Some of the other measures discussed previously, such as fair price
provisions or staggered boards, might be included here.
In addition to possible restrictions in the company charter and state laws, com-
panies may be limited from using the recapitalization defense by restrictive covenants
in prior debt agreements. The corporation enters into these legal agreements when
it borrows from a bank or from investors through the issuance of corporate bonds.
Such agreements place limitations on the firm’s future options so as to provide greater
assurance for the lenders that the debt will be repaid. The language of these restrictive
covenants might prevent the company from taking on additional debt, which might
increase the probability that the company could be forced into receivership.
Use of Recapitalization Plans Protected by Poison Pills
The recapitalization plan is the company’s own offer, which is presented to stockholders
as an alternative to a hostile raider’s offer. Before 1988, companies used poison pills to
try to counteract the bidder’s tender offer while presenting their own unencumbered
74 “The New Way to Halt Raiders,” New York Times, May 29, 1988, D4.

recapitalization plan. In November 1988, a Delaware Chancery Court struck down the
combined use of these defenses.76 In a case involving a challenge to the use by Interco
of a recapitalization plan and a poison pill in opposition to a hostile bid from the Rales
Brothers, the court ruled that both offers should be presented on an equal footing to
shareholders as opposed to having the poison pill directed at the tender offer while not
affecting the company’s own recapitalization plan offer.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Recapitalization Plans
The shareholder wealth effects of recapitalization plans differ depending on the reason
for the recapitalization. If it is a recapitalization that is done for reasons other than
to defend against a takeover, such as to change the company’s capital structure to
increase stockholder return, the shareholder wealth effects tend to be positive. For
example, Handa and Radhakrishnan found that for the 42 recapitalizations that they
studied, shareholder returns were 23% for the period between 60 and 15 days prior
to the event, with some other days of positive returns before day 0 for the group of
firms in their sample that were actual takeover targets.77 For firms that were not actual
takeover targets there was no run-up in prices and some days of negative returns before
the recapitalization. Gupta and Rosenthal found similar positive returns for the period
leading up to the announcement of the recapitalization (26.7%) for firms that were in
play and lower but positive returns (15.1%) for those that were not in play.78
These results are somewhat intuitive. Defensive recapitalizations usually generate
a substantial amount of cash that can be used as an alternative to the offer from the
hostile bidder. These shareholder wealth effects, however, are initial stock market reac-
tions. Whether the recapitalization is good for the long-term welfare of the corporation
is another issue.
Dennis and David found that 31% of the 29 recapitalizations that they studied that
did leveraged recapitalizations encountered subsequent financial distress.79 Nine either
filed Chapter 11 or had to restructure claims out of court. They attributed many of
these problems to industry-wide troubles, as well as poor proceeds from asset sales. This
was the case, for example, in the Interco recapitalization, which we discuss in a separate
case study. Interco believed it would generate greater proceeds from asset sales, which
could be used to pay down debt. These overly optimistic assessments were not shared
by the market.
Assume More Debt
Although the assumption of more debt occurs in a recapitalization plan, the firm can
also directly add debt without resorting to the implementation of recapitalization to

prevent a takeover. A low level of debt relative to equity can make a company vulnerable
to a takeover. A hostile bidder can utilize the target’s borrowing capacity to help finance
the acquisition of the target. Although some may interpret a low level of debt to be
beneficial to the corporation, by lowering its risk, it can also increase the company’s vul-
nerability to a takeover. However, additional debt can make the target riskier because of
the higher debt service relative to the target’s cash flow. This is something of a scorched
earth defense because preventing the acquisition by assuming additional debt may result
in the target’s future bankruptcy.
INTERCO: THE PROBLEMS WITH
RECAPITALIZATION
I
nterco’s recapitalization plan and the company’s subsequent ﬁnancial problems is
a highly instructive case study. It highlights the problems not only of too much
leverage but also of overoptimistic projections that often underlie both takeover
and recapitalization failures.
In the fall of 1988, St. Louis–based Interco, a diverse manufacturer of well-known
products, such as London Fog rainwear, Converse shoes, and Ethan Allan and
Broyhill furniture, found itself the object of a hostile bid from the Rales Brothers.
Steven and Michael Rales, relatively little-known investors from Washington, DC,
had offered $74 per share in a $2.73 billion all-cash tender offer. Interco responded
with a recapitalization plan defense. This defense was coupled with a poison pill,
however. As is explained elsewhere in this chapter, the use of a poison pill to
shield a recapitalization plan was found to be illegal by a Delaware Chancery
Court. Nonetheless, the recapitalization plan proved sufﬁcient to counter the Rales
Brothers’ offer. Although the recapitalization plan ensured Interco’s independence,
it did so at a drastic price. The plan, in part developed by merger strategists
Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, increased Interco’s debt service obligations
beyond the ﬁrm’s ability to pay. The result was a cash ﬂow crisis that culminated in
the ﬁrm’s eventual default on June 15, 1990. Holders of junk bonds issued in the
recapitalization process eventually had to accept equity in exchange for their bonds
to avoid further losses that would result from bankruptcy.a
The expected success of the Interco recapitalization plan was contingent on the
accuracy of the forecasts developed for asset sales and revenues from the company’s
operations. This plan, labeled Project Imperial, was reported by the Wall Street
Journal to have been developed by “a few number crunching ﬁnancial people with
very little oversight from top ofﬁcials at either Interco or Wasserstein-Perella.”b The
Journal reported that 10-year projections of cash ﬂows and earnings were made by a
team of ﬁnancial analysts, one of whom was only one-and-a-half years out of college,
without the beneﬁt of much basic research. Several scenarios were considered, but
the worst case showed a 20% annual return following the recapitalization.
The ﬁrm of Wasserstein-Perella earned $5.5 million for its work in the anti-
takeover defense of Interco. The plan it developed called for the sale of divisions
such as the Ethan Allen furniture chain for approximately $500 million. However, the
eventual sale price proved to be only $388 million. The Central Hardware division
was valued at $312 million in the recapitalization plan but brought only $245 million

when it was sold. Record annual proﬁts of $70 million were forecasted for divisions
such as Converse shoes, whereas ﬁscal 1990 proﬁts proved to be only $11 million.
Given the volatile and competitive nature of the athletic shoe industry (particularly
at that time when there were more competitors that engaged in aggressive compe-
tition), the continual generation of increasing proﬁt levels would be a most difﬁcult
task for any company in this industry (Figure A).

The fate of the Interco recapitalization plan is symbolic of much of what went
wrong in the world of leveraged mergers during the late 1980s. Seemingly sophis-
ticated ﬁnancial analysis could be developed to make risky leveraged deals appear
attractive. For those deals that fell into bankruptcy, the accuracy valuation analysis
was questioned.c

The target can acquire the additional debt in two ways: It can borrow directly from
a bank or other lender, or it can issue bonds. If the target has to wait for SEC approval
for the bonds to be issued, it might be taken over before the debt issuance is completed.
Companies with this defense in mind can prepare for it by obtaining prior SEC approval
to issue bonds and taking advantage of SEC Rule 415, which is called the shelf registration
rule.ThisruleallowsthecorporationtoregisterwiththeSECallthosesecuritiesofferings

Issue More Shares
Another antitakeover option available to the target company is to issue more shares.
Issuing more shares changes the company’s capital structure because it increases equity
while maintaining the current level of debt. By issuing more shares, the target com-
pany makes it more difficult and costly to acquire a majority of the stock in the target.
The notion of increasing the number of shares to make it more difficult for a raider to
obtain control has been around for some time. Matthew Josephson, in his book The Rob-
ber Barons, points out how this tactic was used to prevent Cornelius Vanderbilt from
obtaining control of the Erie Railroad: “This explains how the ‘Erie Gang’ or the Erie
Lackawanna Railroad successfully prevented the New York Central Railroad, a precur-
sor to today’s Conrail, and Cornelius Vanderbilt from taking control of Erie. Every time
Vanderbilt came close to getting a majority, Erie would issue more shares.”80 On the
negative side, issuing more shares dilutes stockholder equity. It is reasonable to expect
the company’s stock price to decline in the face of this stock issuance. This downward
movement in the company’s stock price is the market’s reflection of the costs of this
issuance. In the presence of these clear costs to stockholders, many states specifically
require that corporations receive adequate compensation in return for the newly issued
shares. When the shares are issued and not given to a particular group or company, they
are called a general issue. However, because these shares might fall into hostile bidders’
hands, the target often issues these shares directly into friendly hands. Such is the case
in a white squire defense, where the target both increases the number of shares neces-
sary to obtain control and makes sure that these newly issued shares will not fall into
the hostile bidder’s hands.
As an example of a defensive share issuance, in 1999, Gucci, which was incor-
porated in the Netherlands (for tax reasons) but operated out of Italy, issued more
shares as a defense against a hostile bid from LVMH. Gucci sold a 40% stake in the
company to Francois Pinault, the owner of French retail giant Pinault-Printemps.
This led to a two-year acerbic battle between LVMH and its chief executive officer,
Bernard Arnault, and Pinault, who at one time each sued the other for libel. The two
eventually reached a settlement in 2001 that enabled Pinault to become a white knight
for Gucci while LVMH earned gains on the stake it had accumulated in Gucci. In 2004,
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute made an offer to buy out the minority shareholders and
take the company private. In 2013, the company renamed itself Kering.
Share Issuance and ESOPs
Another option that the target may consider is to issue stock in an employee stock own-
ership plan (ESOP). To make it easy for the ESOP to purchase these shares, the ESOP may
borrow using the corporation’s guarantee. The company may also make tax-deductible
contributions into the ESOP that may then be used to repay the loan. In using ESOPs
as a defensive tactic, the target must make sure that the price paid by the ESOP for the
target’s securities is fair. If the company pays too high a price, the transaction could be

judged improper according to the federal employee benefit laws. If the ESOP is allowed
to buy the shares at too low a price, directors could be charged with violating their fidu-
ciary duties to non-ESOP shareholders. Employee stock ownership plans are discussed
in greater detail in Chapter 9.
In light of the passage of the Delaware antitakeover law, leveraged bust-up acqui-
sitions can be impeded by placing 15% of a firm’s outstanding shares in an ESOP.
In December 1989, Chevron Corporation, to prevent a takeover by cash-rich Penzoil
Corporation, issued 14.1 million shares to create an ESOP. Chevron borrowed $1 billion
to repurchase the newly issued shares.81 Before the issuance of these shares, employees
had held 11% of Chevron’s outstanding shares through a profit-sharing program.
In an effort to offset the dilution effects of the share issuance, having perceived that
the takeover threat had passed, Chevron announced a program of stock repurchases
in 1990.
Chevron survived this takeover threat and grew into one of the larger companies
in the oil industry. This was accomplished partly through its $35 billion acquisition of
Texaco in November 2000.
Buy Back Shares
Another way to try prevent a takeover is for the target to buy back its own shares. Such
share repurchases can have several advantages for a target corporation. They can divert
shares away from a hostile bidder and also arbitragers who would quickly sell to a bidder
if the price was right. Once the target has acquired certain shares, these shares are no
longer available for the bidder to purchase. If these share repurchases are financed with
debt, then they can also benefit by using up some of the target’s unused debt capacity.82
The acquisition of shares can be a necessary first step in implementing a white squire
defense. If the target does not have enough SEC-authorized shares available, it must first
acquire them through share repurchases.
Federal securities laws limit the ability of a target to repurchase its own shares
after it has become the recipient of a target offer. These laws require the target to file
with the SEC and to provide certain disclosures, including the number of shares to
be repurchased, the purpose of the transaction, and the source of funding. Although
share repurchases have several clear advantages for a target corporation, they are
not without drawbacks. Share repurchases may be an instinctive first reaction by an
embattled target CEO who is striving to maintain the company’s independence. By
repurchasing the company’s shares, however, the CEO is withdrawing outstanding
shares from the market. With fewer shares outstanding, it may be easier for the acquirer
to obtain control because the bidder has to buy a smaller number of shares to acquire
51% of the target.
One solution to this dilemma is to use targeted share repurchases. This strategy
takes shares out of the hands of those who would most likely sell them to the hostile

bidder. If, at the same time, these shares are placed in friendly hands, the strategy can
be successful. When CHH combined a buyback of 17.5 million shares in 1984 with a
sale of stock to General Cinema Corporation, it was implementing a similar strategy to
prevent The Limited from obtaining control of CHH.
Famous Discriminatory Self-Tender: Unocal versus Mesa
In February 1985, T. Boone Pickens announced a bid from his investor group, Mesa
Partners II, for Unocal Corporation.83 Mesa had just purchased 8% of the larger Los
Angeles–based oil company. Pickens’s company, Mesa Petroleum, was flush with cash
from successful prior offers for Gulf and Phillips Petroleum. Pickens made $800 million
on his bid for Gulf and $90 million on the offer for Phillips.84 Pickens has stated that
these gains were not greenmail, based on his long-held position of refusing to accept a
higher payment for his shares unless other shareholders could participate in the buyout
by the target. Pickens increased the pressure on Phillips by increasing his holdings to
13% of Unocal’s outstanding shares. He found Unocal an attractive target because of
its low debt level and significant size (revenues of $11.5 billion). Mesa increased its
credibility by amassing a war chest of $4 billion in financing through the help of its
investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert. In April 1985, Pickens bid for just over
50% of Unocal at $54 per share. Unocal, led by Chairman Fred Hartley, responded with a
discriminatory self-tender offer for 29% of Unocal’s outstanding shares. Hartley wanted
to defeat the Pickens bid but did not want to give his foe greenmail. His self-tender
offer therefore contained a provision that Mesa Partners II could not participate in
Unocal’s offer. Pickens appealed to the Delaware Chancery Court to rule on what he
believed was a clearly unfair offer by Unocal. The Delaware Chancery Court agreed that
Unocal’s offer was illegal, a ruling that was later reversed by the Delaware Supreme
Court. The Delaware Supreme Court concluded on May 17, 1985, that Unocal’s offer
was within the board of directors’ rights according to the business judgment rule. The
court found that Mesa’s offer was a “grossly inadequate two-tiered coercive tender offer
coupled with the threat of greenmail.” The higher court held that Unocal’s response to
this type of offer was within its rights as provided by the business judgment rule. The
Delaware Supreme Court ruling forced Pickens to capitulate; he agreed to a standstill
agreement. Ironically, this ruling led to the SEC’s review of discriminatory self-tenders,
which eventually resulted in a change in tender offer rules making such discriminatory
self-tenders illegal.
The Unocal decision has become a standard guide for directors in the use of anti-
takeover measures. In applying Unocal, courts now look to see if the defensive measures
being used are proportional to the threat perceived. Recall from Chapter 3 that while
coercive and inconsistent with the spirit of the Williams Act, such offers are not ille-
gal in the United States. This is while courts allow more aggressive defensive measures
when targets are faced with such coercive offers. In a later decision clarifying this, the
DelawareSupremeCourtnotedthatthedefensiveresponsemustnotbe“draconian”and

Antitakeover Measures
must be within a “range of reasonableness.”85 In this decision, the Delaware Supreme
Court noted that in applying Unocal, a court must go through a two-step process. The
first step is to determine if the defensive measures go so far as to be coercive or preclusive
and halt a takeover contest that might otherwise be in shareholders’ interests. The sec-
ond step is to see if the defensive measures taken are reasonable in light of the perceived
threat. In the case of Unitrin’s response to American General’s hostile bid, the Delaware
Supreme Court found that the first prong of the test was satisfied, but it took issue with
Unitrin’s repurchase program, although it was not troubled by its poison pill or bylaw
change requiring advance notice of an offer.
Corporate Restructuring as a Takeover Defense
Corporate restructuring is another of the more drastic antitakeover defenses. It may
involve selling off major parts of the target or even engaging in major acquisitions.
Alternatively, it could involve acquisitions, especially ones which use up much of the
company’s unused debt capacity. This may not be that effective a defense—especially if
the bidder can readily sell off the recent acquisitions after a takeover.
Defensive restructuring has been criticized as a case of “Do unto yourself as others
would do unto you.” Given the anticipated criticism, management usually employs this
defense only as a last resort.
Still another restructuring option available for the target company is liquidation. In
liquidation, the target sells all of its assets and uses the proceeds to pay a liquidating
dividend to stockholders. The payment of the dividend is restricted by a variety of legal
constraints that protect the rights of the firm’s creditors. Therefore, the liquidating div-
idend needs to be calculated after financial adjustments have been made to take into
account outstanding obligations that have to be satisfied. In the best interests of stock-
holders, this dividend payment must exceed the offer of the hostile bidder. This may be
possible, however, in instances in which the target believes that, perhaps because of inor-
dinately low securities market prices, the premium above market price offered by the
bidder is below that of the liquidation value of the company.
Litigation as an Antitakeover Defense
Litigation is one of the more common antitakeover defenses. In the early stages of
the hostile takeover era (the mid-1970s), it was an effective means of preventing a
takeover.86 However, its power in this area diminished over time.
One of the first legal maneuvers the target might try is to request that a court grant
an injunction that will prevent the takeover process from continuing. Such an injunc-
tion, coupled with a restraining order, might bar the hostile bidder from purchasing
additional stock until the bidder can satisfy the court that the target’s charges are
without merit.

The temporary halting of a takeover can delay the acquisition, giving the target time
to mount more effective defenses. The additional time can also allow the target to seek
a white knight. Litigation and the grant of injunctive relief may provide the necessary
time to allow a bidding process to develop. Other bidders will now have time to properly
consider the benefits of making an offer for the target. The bidding process should result
in higher offers for the target. Another major benefit of litigation is to give the bidder time
to raise the offer price. The target might indirectly give the bidder the impression that if
the offer price and terms were improved, it would drop the litigation. The more common
forms of defensive litigation include antitrust claims, asserting inadequate disclosure,
and allegations of fraud, as follows.
Litigation Research
In a 1985 study of attempted and completed takeovers that involved litigation between
1962 and 1980, Jarrell found that litigation occurred in one-third of all tender offers.87
As noted previously, litigation may be beneficial for target shareholders even when it
does not result in the acquirer’s retraction of the bid. Jarrell found that 62% of the offers
that had litigation had competing bids, whereas only 11% of those that did not have
litigation had competing offers. He also found that, although it seems reasonable that
litigation would cause bidders to raise their offer price to encourage the target to drop
the litigation and avoid the legal expenses (as well as the possibility that the bid might
be permanently halted), there was no evidence of a significant price effect. On average,
a stock price decline took place when litigation was initiated. This decline occurred
both for firms that were eventually acquired and for those that remained independent.
However, unacquired stock returns fell 23.4%, whereas acquired returns declined
slightly more than 21%.
Jarrell also found that when an auction for the firm resulted following the initia-
tion of litigation, there was an additional 17% premium above the first offer relative to
nonauctioned firms. When litigation results in the bidder’s withdrawing its offer, how-
ever, target company stockholders suffer major losses. They incur both the loss of a
premium, which averaged 32% for Jarrell’s sample of firms, as well as the costs of liti-
gation. We can conclude that litigation may bring benefits for targets, but if the bid is
withdrawn, it may also result in significant losses for target stockholders.
In the 2000s, M&A-related litigation became even more frequent. In fact, in recent
years the mere announcement of a deal attracted lawsuits as the number of M&As with
lawsuits approached 100%. In 2016, the Delaware court, in a case involving claims
of inadequate disclosure of an acquisition offer by Zillow for competitor Trulia, decided
it would not award attorneys’ fees, as the award of such fees was the real goal of the
lawsuit—not the improvement of shareholders’ interests.88

Antitakeover Measures
Pac-Man Defense
The Pac-Man defense, so named after the popular video game in which characters try
to eat each other before they are eaten themselves, is one of the more colorful defenses
employed by target companies. It occurs when the target makes an offer to buy the raider
in response to the raider’s bid for the target. Because of its extreme nature, this defense
is considered a “doomsday machine.” One of the more famous uses of this defense came
when the Martin Marietta Corporation made an offer to buy Bendix following Bendix’s
unwanted $43 tender offer for Martin Marietta in the summer of 1982.
The Pac-Man defense is often threatened but it is seldom used. Before the
Bendix–Martin Marietta takeover battle, two companies had used it in a vain effort
to maintain their independence. In 1982, NLT Corporation ended up merging with
its bidder—American General Corporation. As stated earlier, Cities Service tried the
Pac-Man defense in response to T. Boone Pickens’s bid from Mesa Petroleum. Although
the defense halted Mesa’s bid and helped to convince Mesa to accept greenmail, Cities
Service was nonetheless put in play and ended up selling out to Occidental Petroleum.
In another early use of the Pac-Man defense, Houston Natural Gas Corporation
(which later became Enron Corporation) used a 1984 bid for the raider to try to fend
off the Coastal Corporation. It was not successful because Houston Natural Gas sold off
nearly half its assets to maintain its independence. The Heublein Corporation, however,
threatened to use the Pac-Man defense when it was confronted by General Cinema Cor-
poration and was able to scare away General Cinema.
There have been a limited number of successful uses of the Pac-Man defense. In
1988, E-II Holdings, a diverse group of consumer product companies formed from
the spin-off of 15 companies after the LBO of Beatrice, made an offer for American
Brands—also a collection of various name brand consumer products. This use of the
Pac-Man defense was successful in that the original E-II offer elicited a Pac-Man bid
from American Brands, which was what E-II’s CEO, Donald Kelly, was seeking.
In 1999 there was another successful use of the Pac-Man defense when Chesapeake
Corporation made a responding bid for Shorewood Corporation, which had launched
a hostile bid for Chesapeake. The combination of the Pac-Man offer along with a very
aggressive legal defense enabled Chesapeake to stay independent while, as a result of
Chesapeake’s tender offer, Shorewood was ultimately acquired by a third party. In that
same year, Elf Aquitaine used the Pac-Mac defense to acquire Total Fina. The two large
oil and chemical companies fought a hostile battle after Total Fina made an unwanted
bidforElfAquitaine,whichwantedtoremainindependent.ElfAquitaine,onceownedby
the French government, was warned by the government not to seek a white knight that
would be a non-French company. It saw a Pac-Man bid for Total Fina as its only option.
This did not allow it to acquire its hostile rival but did get shareholders an improved
$52.8 billion bid.
The Pac-Man defense remains rarely used but reappeared in 2014 in the hostile
takeover battle between two men’s clothing chains. When Jos. A. Bank Clothier initiated
a hostile bid for larger rival Men’s Warehouse, the target responded with its own bid for
Jos. A. Bank. That Pac-Man bid proved successful.

Active Antitakeover Defenses

233
“Just Say No”
In the most basic form of antitakeover defense, the target refuses to be taken over, simply
hiding behind its poison pills and other defenses and stating that it will not deactivate
them and will not bring the offer before the shareholders. In the just-say-no defense, the
target may refuse to take any measures, even providing more cash to shareholders, by
stating that it has more optimistic plans for the future of the company.
The Universal Foods Corporation, a manufacturer of products such as French fries
and cheese, used the just-say-no defense in 1989, when it turned down an offer from the
High Voltage Engineering Corporation. When High Voltage Engineering offered $38 per
share, Universal responded that its investment banker, Goldman Sachs, had determined
that this offer was inadequate. Universal’s board of directors decided that profits were
rising and that this was not the time to sell the company. Martin Lipton, the originator
of the just-say-no defense, advised his client, Universal Foods, to reject the offer and not
take any other action. Universal compromised by raising its dividend from 18 cents per
share to 22 cents. The company’s defense, especially its poison pill, was challenged in
court. In March 1989, a federal court judge in Wisconsin ruled that if the company’s
executives believed that the offer was inadequate, they were in a position to determine
an accurate value for the company.
Just Say No Reconciled with Revlon Duties
The just-say-no defense allows directors to reject a bid as inadequate or not in the com-
pany’s long-term interests without putting the company up for sale in an auction. The
just-say-no defense is a post-Revlon concept that target company directors often rally
toward when confronted with an unwanted takeover bid. A leading case in support of
this concept is Paramount Communications v. Time.89 In this attempted takeover, Time
Inc.’s directors rejected Paramount’s bid in favor of Warner Communications Inc. The
just-say-no defense may be challenged by higher offers that will counter the board of
directors’ position that the future value of the company is worth more to stockholders
than the offer price. There will always be some price that will leave the board of directors
with no choice but to approve the offer.
There are a number of recent examples of profitable use of the just-say-no defense.
In 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner, which the target rejected as
inadequate, although its stock rose in speculation that another, higher bid would mate-
rialize. That happened in 2016, when AT&T offered $85 billion in cash and stock (but
subject to antitrust approval). In 2014, Allergan fought off a bid by Valeant and hedge
fund manager William Ackman. This proved to be of great benefit to shareholders when
Allergan was acquired in 2015 by Actavis in a $66 billion deal. In addition, saying no to
Valeant enabled Allergan to avoid the various accounting and public relations problems
that beset Valeant in 2016.

INFORMATION CONTENT OF TAKEOVER RESISTANCE
Throughout this chapter, we have reviewed a variety of antitakeover defenses and have
analyzed the shareholder wealth effects of several of these defenses. Looking at defenses
more globally, Pound has studied the information content of takeover bids and the resis-
tance of the target to the takeover.90 Pound used consensus earnings forecasts as a proxy
for the market’s expected value of the targets as stand-alone entities. The effect of dif-
ferent types of takeover contests and defenses on the market’s value of the target was
assessed by considering whether the consensus changed. These tests were conducted
for three samples: targets of friendly bids, targets of hostile bids that were ultimately
acquired, and targets of hostile bids that remained independent. Pound observed that
the consensus forecasts were unchanged after the initial takeover bid. He therefore con-
cluded that the bids themselves do not convey important information. The unchanged
forecasts also imply that the bid did not reveal to the marketplace a previously undiscov-
ered case of undervaluation.
Pound found the resistance to a takeover to be associated with a downward revision
of the average earnings forecasts of approximately 10%. This was the case both for firms
that were acquired and for those that remained independent. Pound concluded that the
market interprets the resistance as a negative signal about future performance.
BENDIX VERSUS MARTIN MARIETTA
O
ne of the most colorful takeover battles in U.S. economic history was the
contest between the Bendix Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation.
Bendix was led by its chairman, William Agee, who got his training in acqui-
sitions while chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer of Boise Cascade Corporation. Boise Cascade
was a forest products company that transformed itself into a conglomerate through
diverse acquisitions in the 1960s. Agee joined Bendix in 1972 as executive vice pres-
ident, reporting to Michael Blumenthal, who left to become secretary of the treasury
in the Carter Administration. At the age of 38 years, Agee was named chairman of
the company, which had two main lines of business, auto products, such as ignition
systems and brakes, and aviation products for the defense industry.
In August 1982, after an aborted takeover attempt of RCA, Agee began his bid
for Martin Marietta, a company that was an established presence in the defense
industry, particularly in aerospace products, such as missile systems. Bendix made
a $43 tender offer for 45% of Martin Marietta (Bendix already had just under 5%
of Martin Marietta), which was previously selling for $33 per share. Martin Marietta
rejected the offer and initiated its own $75-per-share tender offer for Bendix, which
had been previously selling for $50 per share.
Although Bendix, a Delaware corporation, bid for Martin Marietta ﬁrst, Martin
Marietta was incorporated in Maryland and that state’s corporation laws required
any bidder to give the target 10 days’ notice before calling an election of the board

no. 2 (December 1988): 207–227.

of directors. This gave Martin Marietta an apparent advantage over Bendix because
Martin Marietta could complete its tender offer for Bendix, following the necessary
20-day Williams Act waiting period that affected both offers, change Bendix’s board
of directors, and call off Bendix’s tender offer before Bendix could do the same
at Martin Marietta. Arthur Fleischer, of the ﬁrm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver, and
Jacobson, had advised Agee that Bendix’s corporate charter’s election rules should
be amended to remove this advantage, but that was never done.
Each ﬁrm engaged in various defenses, including litigation. Bendix adopted
golden parachutes; Martin Marietta searched for a white knight. They found a gray
knight, Harry Gray, chairman of United Technologies Corporation, who agreed to
make a backup tender offer for Martin Marietta if its offer for Bendix failed.
Agee counted on the 23% of the company’s stock that was held in an employee
stock ownership plan (ESOP) that was managed by Citibank’s trustee. Martin Mari-
etta’s tender offer was two-tiered, with better consideration being offered for the
ﬁrst tier. Citibank concluded that its ﬁduciary responsibilities were with the ﬁnancial
well-being of the ESOP shareholders and not based on any other loyalty to Bendix.
Many of the employees, however, did not agree with this assessment.
Although Agee may have believed that he could have reached agreement
with Martin Marietta to drop its offer, Martin Marietta could not count on United
Technologies to simply walk away, so it went ahead with its bid for Bendix and raised
the offer price. The absurdity of the deal was that it looked as if both companies
would end up buying each other, with each company being debt-laden after the
transaction.
Bendix contacted Edward Hennessy, then chairman of Allied Signal, to be its
white knight. Hennessy bid for Bendix and won control of the company. He then
reached agreement with Thomas Pownall, CEO of Martin Marietta, to exchange
shares. Martin Marietta remained independent but highly leveraged. Hennessy
ended up with valuable Bendix assets.

CHAPTER SIX
Takeover Tactics
F
ROM A TARGET’S PERSPECTIVE, hostile bids are offers that the target publicly
refuses to accept. In this chapter, we focus on the options hostile bidders can use
to complete a takeover of an unwilling target.
The fourth merger wave is considered by some the era of the hostile takeover;
however, even during that period most takeovers were friendly deals. By the time we
reached the fifth merger wave of the 1990s, the percentage of friendly deals increased
even more. For example, using one dataset Andrade Stafford and Mitchell found that
14% of deals were unfriendly in the 1980s, but that percentage fell to only 4% in
the 1990s.1 In the 2000s, friendly deals are still much more common. Nonetheless,
hostile deals are still important and actually can be interesting if not even entertaining.
This chapter analyzes the evolution of takeover tactics over the past quarter of a
century and discusses how they are currently used and their relative effectiveness. It will
become apparent that these tactics have evolved and changed substantially over time.
The takeover options for the hostile bidder are fewer in number compared with the
broad variety of defenses that targets implement in advance of and during a hostile bid.
The bidder is typically left with the choice of three main tactics: a bear hug, a tender offer,
and a proxy fight. Each tactic has its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, each may
be implemented in varying manners to increase the likelihood of success. The options
and their shareholder wealth effects are the focus of this chapter.
Of the main takeover tactics, bear hugs are the least aggressive and often occur at
the beginning of a hostile takeover. When the target is not strongly opposed to a takeover,
a bear hug may be sufficient. However, for a determined and firmly entrenched target,

it is unlikely that a bear hug will be sufficient to complete the takeover. However, a bear
hug may be a precursor to an eventual tender offer.
We also discuss tender offers. The rules governing such offers in the United States
were already discussed in Chapter 3. In this chapter, we will focus on the tactical
elements of tender offers.
Another takeover tactic covered in this chapter is proxy fights. In this chapter,
we discuss not only the tactical aspects of proxy fights but also the relevant rules and
regulations and shareholder wealth effects.
PRELIMINARY TAKEOVER STEPS
Casual Pass
Before initiating hostile actions, the bidder may attempt some informal overture to
the management of the target. This is sometimes referred to as a casual pass. It may
come from a member of the bidder’s management or from one of its representatives,
such as its investment banker. In fact, an approach from the bidder’s bankers is often
the least threatening. If the approach, however, comes from the bidder’s senior manage-
ment, then the bidder should have a well-thought-out plan to put forward at that time.
When the bidder’s senior management is making the approach, it will usually prefer
a meeting as opposed to a telephone conference. The meeting allows a more detailed
discussion, and the bidder can present an offer letter at that time.
A casual pass may be used if the bidder is unsure of the target’s response. If the target
has been the subject of other hostile bids that it has spurned, or if the target has pub-
licly stated its desire to remain independent, this step may provide few benefits. In fact,
it can work against the bidder because it provides the target with advance warning of
the bidder’s interest. In most takeover battles, the target tries to buy more time while the
bidder seeks to force the battle to a quick conclusion. Managers of potential target com-
panies are often advised by their attorneys to not engage in loose discussions that could
be misconstrued as an expression of interest. They are often told to unequivocally state
that the target wants to remain independent.
Establishing a Toehold
An initial step that is often pursued before using the various takeover tactics that are at
the disposal of a hostile bidder is to begin an initial accumulation of the target’s shares.
In doing so, the bidder seeks to establish a toehold from which to launch its hostile bid.
One of the advantages of such share purchases is that if the market is unaware of its
actions, the bidder may be able to avoid the payment of a premium for the shares that
form the toehold. This may lower the average cost of the acquisition. In addition, it may
provide the bidder with some of the same rights that other shareholders have, thus
establishing a fiduciary duty, which the board would now have in its dual role as the hos-
tile bidder and as the target shareholder. This is why target defenses that relate to share
acquisitions are exclusionary and usually leave out the accumulator/hostile bidder.

Preliminary Takeover Steps

This is often a subject of litigation between the company and the bidder. In addition, if a
rival bidder acquires the target, the initial bidder may receive a premium on its toehold
position, thereby providing it with potentially significant gains. Various researchers
have showed that bidders with toeholds have a higher probability of acquiring the
target.2
In light of the benefits just discussed, it is surprising that toeholds are not more
prevalent. Researchers have categorized toeholds into two groups: short-term toeholds,
which were purchased less than six months from an offer date; and long-term toeholds,
which were purchased more than six months from the offer date. Betton, Eckbo, and
Thorburn found a toehold frequency of 13%, with short-term toeholds of only 2%!3
There are costs that offset many of the benefits of toeholds; otherwise, most bids would
have toeholds.
Pursuant to the requirements of Sec 13(d) of the Williams Act, bidders have to
disclose their holdings by filing a Schedule 13D within 10 days after acquiring 5% of a
target’s stock. This disclosure can convey a competitive advantage to rival bidders and
could possibly weaken the bidder’s bargaining position relative to the target. There may
also be additional required disclosure to antitrust agencies related to Hart-Scott-Rodino.
Another significant cost could be share price declines if the bid is not successful.
The stock price may fall after it becomes clear that the bid is withdrawn. This may cause
the bidder to incur a loss on its toehold acquisition. Still another cost is that the target’s
management, especially targets with entrenched managers, may not respond well to the
existence of a toehold and may conclude that the bidder’s offer is hostile in nature. This
may make meaningful merger negotiations problematic, and with that the likelihood
of receiving a termination fee if the target is ultimately sold to another bidder may be
significantly lower.
Interestingly, Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn found the distribution of their large
sample to be bimodal.4 That is, many bidders choose to forgo any toehold due to
concerns about the costs while others may amass large toeholds, such as 25%. Not
surprisingly, hostile bids tend to more likely be associated with toeholds compared to
friendly offers. Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn report that 11% of friendly initial bidders
in their sample had a toehold, whereas 50% of hostile bidders had toeholds.5
Information Asymmetry
One of the difficulties hostile bidders have is that they have to construct an offer with-
out the benefit of information from the target that often is available in friendly deals.

Takeover Tactics
The bidder has to determine which of the target’s assets might be lost after the target
is acquired. For example, if the target has important contracts that might be lost if the
target is acquired, this could lower its value and result in a lower bid. Such value leakage
can be a real cause of concern. Therefore, it is very important that the bidder do dili-
gent research and gain access to all relevant public information that can help create an
enlightened offer.
Takeover Contest Process
When a bidder and target seek to pursue a friendly deal, they sign a merger agreement.
However, the target’s board of directors is required to still consider other bids as a way
making sure they maximize shareholder wealth. This is referred to as the fiduciary out
clause that is part of merger agreements.
Figure 6.1 shows the three common outcomes that can occur after an initial bid.
The target may accept the offer, and no other bidders may enter the fray. The target can
also choose to reject the offer, and either there will be other offers or no other bidder
may materialize. If a rival bidder makes an offer, then several outcomes are possible. The
target can reject all offers, or either the initial bidder or a rival bidder wins the takeover
contest.Betton,Eckbo,andThorburnanalyzed35,727takeovercontestsovertheperiod
1980–2005.6 Eighty-one percent were merger bids while 12.6% were tender offers and
6.2% were control-block trades.
A bidder has to consider the responses of not just the target but also other bid-
ders. In an analysis of thousands of bids over the period 1980–2002 Betton, Eckbo,
and Thorburn found that the initial bidder was successful two-thirds of the time.7

Preliminary Takeover Steps

This probability is significantly lower when the bidder contacts the target to negotiate
a merger as opposed to being more assertive and making a strong tender offer. When
a rival bidder enters the fray, the rival prevails twice as often as the initial bidder does.8
So a key for the initial bidder is to structure its first bid so that it will preempt other bid-
ders while not overpaying. This can be termed the optimal bid. Once an auction occurs,
then all bidders have to try to avoid paying the winner’s curse. This is why they need to
be very careful in crafting bid jumps—particularly if they put forward a rich initial bid.
Bid Jumps
As we have noted, a target’s board has an obligation to consider other offers. If the
initial bid is followed by one or more bids from other firms, we have an auction process.
Betton and Eckbo found the time between the first and second bids to be 15 days in their
sample.9 It was somewhat longer in the later study by Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn—
40 days.10
Betton and Eckbo found that when a new bidder had a toehold, the approximate
size of that toehold was similar to that of the initial bidder. To them this implied that the
second bidder amassed its toehold to match any advantages the initial bidder’s toehold
gave it.
Betton and Eckbo as well as Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn found that the premium
offer by single bidders was somewhat higher than the premium offered by an initial
bidder in a takeover contest involving multiple bidders. One interpretation of this dif-
ference is a desire by the single bidder to preempt other bidders by making a strong offer
they might not want to match and also making an offer that would impress the target’s
board and shareholders.11 One should not put too much weight into this conclusion,
and the differences between the single bidder premium and that of the initial bidder in a
contest were not all that great.
One of the more interesting findings of Betton and Eckbo was the magnitude of bid
jumps that are the differences in offer price between succeeding bids. They found an
average bid jump of 10% for a second bid compared to the initial bid. This translated
into a 31% increase in the premium. They also found a 14% increase from the initial bid
to the final bid, which resulted in a 65% increase in the premium.
Bear Hugs
A bidder will sometimes try to pressure the management of the target before initiating a
tender offer. This may be done by contacting the board of directors with an expression of
interest in acquiring the target and the implied intent to go directly to stockholders with

Takeover Tactics
a tender offer if these overtures are not favorably received. This strategy—known as the
bear hug—may also be accompanied by a public announcement of the bidder’s intent to
make a tender offer.
There are two kinds of bear hugs. A teddy bear hug is one that does not include a price
or specific deal terms. It is also not meant to be made public. This kind of an overture is
much less threatening than a normal bear hug, which often does include a price and is
meant to be made public.
The bear hug forces the target’s board to take a public position on the possible
takeover by this bidder. Such offers carry with them the implication that if it is not favor-
ably received, it will be immediately followed by a tender offer directly to shareholders.
A bear hug also puts pressure on the board of directors because it must be considered
lest the board be regarded as having violated its fiduciary duties.
Once a bear hug becomes public, arbitragers typically accumulate the target’s stock.
Depending on the companies involved, they may even want to sell the bidder’s shares
short based on the fact that when bidders make takeover offers, the bidder’s shares may
decline after the announcement. The accumulation of shares by arbitragers may make
large share block purchases easier for the initiator of the bear hug or any other bid-
der. This often puts the company in play, which makes continued independence more
difficult.
A stronger version of the standard bear hug occurs when one bidder offers a specific
price in order to, among other reasons, establish a range for damages in possible stock-
holder lawsuits that might follow the target management’s rejection of the bid. This
tactic increases the pressure on the target’s board, which might be the object of the law-
suits. The typical response of an unreceptive target board is to acquire a fairness opinion
from an investment bank that will say that the offer is inadequate. This gives the board of
directors a “legitimate” reason to reject the offer. If the bidder makes a public announce-
ment while engaging in a bear hug, the bidder is bound to file pursuant to Rule 14d-2
of the Williams Act and is required to disseminate tender offer materials or abandon the
offer within five days. If the target discloses the offer, the bidder is not required to file.
From a strategic point of view, if the bidder sees a realistic possibility of a negotiated
transaction, the bear hug may be an attractive alternative to a tender offer. It is a less
expensive and less time-consuming way to conduct a “hostile” acquisition. It may also
reduce the adverse consequences that sometimes are associated with hostile deals, such
as the loss of key target employees and a deterioration of employee morale following the
acquisition. If the target strongly opposes the acquisition, however, the bear hug may be
unsuccessful, leaving the bidder to pursue other methods, such as a tender offer.
Bidders who are reluctant to engage in a costly tender offer begin to use the bear
hug as an initial, less expensive takeover tool. The advantage is that the pressure placed
on the target’s board of directors may be sufficient to complete the takeover.
Stock Price Runups and Markups
It is not unusual to see a target’s stock price increase in advance of an eventual offer
by an initial bidder. There are various explanations for such a runup, including rumors

Preliminary Takeover Steps
◾
243
that a company might be a target as well as formal statements made in SEC 13(d) filings.
The question that researchers have focused on was whether this runup reflected an
anticipated premium that would be paid if the company was eventually acquired by
some bidder. It would have a probability-adjusted amount that reflected the discounted
present value of the premium times the probability that the deal would be completed.
If this is the case, though, then the market has a specific “pre-rumor” premium, and as
of the runup some of this is already incorporated into the stock price. If that is the case,
then the eventual premium offered would be less than what would have been offered
if there were no runup. However, as Schwert has pointed out, the runup phenomenon
means that the premium is as set forth as in equation 6.1.12
Premium = Runup + Markup
(6.1)
When the runup reflects the market increased valuation of the target, perhaps based
on new information, including the interest of more investors in the target, the combina-
tion of the runup and markup could result in a higher premium than what would have
occurred. In an effort to empirically measure the component of a takeover premium that
was caused by the runup, Schwert estimated the following relationship:
Premiumi = α + β Runupi + ui
(6.2)
He found that β (remember, not beta from CAPM) was statistically significant
(t value of 2.88) and equal to 1.13, which means that for every dollar of a runup, the
takeover premium increased by $1.13.13 The runup increases the premium.
The question that arises is whether the runup lowers the markup and whether
there is some substitution going on between runup and the eventual offer markup. This
question was addressed by Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn, who estimated the following
relationship:14
Markupi = α′ + β′ Runupi + ́εεXi + ui
(6.3)
They found that the runup was strongly statistically significant (t = −15.44) and
that the sign of β was negative, indicating a trade-off between the runup and the markup
(X is a set of target and bidder characteristics). Specifically they found that β′ was −0.18.
So this means that the runup causes the premium to rise, but the markup is lower than
what it would be if there was no runup. The combined effect is an initial offer price effect
of $0.82.
Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn also found that the runup was greater when the
bidder purchased a target toehold during the runup period. Therefore, they shed light

Bypass Offers
Before we begin our discussions of tender offers, it is useful to discuss which types of
targets are more likely to receive bypass offers. A bypass offer is one that is unsolicited
and that was not preceded by negotiations or discussions between the managements
of the two companies. They are called bypass offers as the bidder, thinking the
reception will automatically be negative, bypassing the target’s management and board
and makes a bid directly to shareholders. Bange and Mazzeo found that targets whose
CEO was also the chair of the board were more likely to receive bypass offers.15 This
could be because the bidder believed that management was entrenched and more
likely to oppose the offer. They also found that offers made to targets that had largely
independent boards were less likely to be successful and, surprisingly, the initial offer
premium is likely to be lower than their less-independent counterparts.
Bange and Mazzeo did find that bypass offers were more likely to be successful
and also featured greater gains for target shareholders. This supports the intuitive
conclusion that a bidder, often using the services of a mergers and acquisitions (M&A)

consultant such as an investment banker, can usually get a good sense of whether a
target is going to be receptive to an offer, along with what type of offer will be needed
for a deal to be completed.
TENDER OFFERS
Because the Williams Act is the key piece of federal legislation that regulates tender
offers, it is ironic that the law does not even define the term. Instead, it has been left to the
courts to formulate an exact definition. This ambiguity has naturally led to some con-
fusion regarding what constitutes a tender offer. In some instances, bidders, believing
that their actions were not a tender offer, have failed to follow the rules and procedures
of the Williams Act. This occurred in the landmark case discussed in Chapter 3 involv-
ing the bid by Sun Oil Inc. for the Becton Dickinson Company. In late 1977, Sun Oil
structured a deal with Fairleigh S. Dickinson, founder of the New Jersey private college
of the same name, to purchase shares that Fairleigh Dickinson, his family, and other
related parties held. Because the company did not file the proper disclosure statements
at the time this agreement was reached, the court ruled that it had violated the Williams
Act under the definition of a group as offered by the law. In deciding the case, the fed-
eral district court ruled that the establishment of an agreement between Dickinson and
Sun Oil to sell shares to Sun and to have Dickinson become chairman of Becton Dickin-
son following its acquisition by Sun Oil warranted a disclosure filing. In arriving at its
decision, the court established a definition of a tender offer, naming eight factors that
are characteristic of a tender offer.16 These factors, which were covered in Chapter 3,
are listed in Table 6.1.
The eighth point was not relevant to the Wellman v. Dickinson case and was not
discussed in this ruling. It is derived from an earlier ruling. Not all eight factors must be

Takeover Tactics
present for an offer to be judged a tender offer. The court did not want the eight factors
to constitute an automatic litmus test for tender offers.
Long-Form Merger
One of the more basic ways a bidder can acquire a target is through a long-form merger.
Here, the acquirer seeks 100% ownership in a one-step transaction through which it
wins shareholder voting approval of the takeover and sale of shares. This involves the
bidder issuing a detailed proxy statement that must be preapproved by the SEC and then
mailed to the target’s shareholders. In a tender offer, however, the tender offer materials
do not have to be preapproved by the SEC prior to mailing to shareholders.
Tender Offer—A Two-Step Transaction
Prior to August 2013, there were two main ways to acquire a public target. One was
to do a statutory merger that required that the target’s shareholders vote to approve
the deal—a long-form merger. Here, the target prepares and issues a proxy statement
and a special meeting of the target’s shareholders is held at which voting approval of
the deal is sought. The other way was to do a two-step tender offer, with the first step
being a tender offer, which was then followed by a second step transaction. In Delaware,
if 90% or more shares were acquired with the first step tender offer, then the deal could
be completed with a short-form merger (discussed shortly) without having to solicit tar-
get shareholder approval. If less than 90% was gained, then shareholder approval was
needed—a long-form merger.
If the buyer failed to get 90% it could request that the target give it a top-up option,
which would allow the buyer to buy sufficient newly issued shares to allow the buyer to
cross the threshold and then do a short-form merger (i.e., 90%) and acquire the target.
However, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have rules and limitations on the
number of shares a company can issue without gaining shareholder approval. Effec-
tively, the target must have a sufficient number of shares authorized but unissued, along
with treasury shares, to be able to quickly pursue the top-up option.
In August 2013 the Delaware General Corporation Law was amended and a new
section was added, 251 (h), which provided for a quicker and less costly route to com-
plete two-step transactions. With this change in the law, buyers are allowed to do a
second step, short-form merger without having to win a shareholder vote as long as they
own at least the percentage of shares of the target’s stock that would have been required
to adopt the merger agreement given the target’s corporation rules and Delaware law.
Rule 251h requires that conditions are met:
◾
The target has more than 2,000 holders.
◾
The merger agreement expressly provides that it will be governed by 251h.
◾
The buyer does a tender offer for any and all shares that would normally have a vote
on the merger.
◾
After the tender offer, the buyer has a majority of the shares of the target.

As of the time that the board approved the merger, there were no other interested
shareholders.
◾
The buyer of the shares offers to merge with or into the target.
◾
The outstanding shares not purchased in the tender offer received the same consid-
eration as the shares that were purchased.
Short-Form Merger
In a short-form merger, if the buyer acquires a minimum threshold dictated by rele-
vant state law. In most states, including Delaware, it is 90% but in a few states, such
as Alabama, Florida, and Montana, it is 80%. After reaching that level, the buyer may
simply close out the remaining shareholders, who then receive the compensation the
acquirer paid to the other shareholders, and the buyer is not required to solicit the vot-
ing approval of those remaining shareholders. The buyer only needs to file an articles of
merger with the secretary of state of incorporation.
Time Periods: Tender Offer versus Long-Form Merger
A tender offer is more complex but potentially quicker than a long-form merger.
Through a tender offer a bidder may be able to acquire control in 20 to 40 business
days. In a long-form merger, control may not be achieved until, say, two to four months.
One of the many reasons that a tender offer is quicker is that voting approval of the
target shareholders is not needed. They approve by selling their shares to the bidder.
Open Market Purchases
Thecourtshavegenerallyfoundthatopenmarketpurchasesdonotbythemselvesrepre-
sent a tender offer. Generally, they do require that the purchaser file a Schedule TO. One
version of open market purchases is a creeping tender offer, which is the process of gradu-
ally acquiring shares in the market or through private transactions. Although under
certain circumstances these purchases may require a Schedule TO filing, the courts
generally do not regard such purchases as a legal tender offer. Courts have repeatedly
found that the purchase of stock from sophisticated institutional investors is not under
the domain of the Williams Act.17 However, the courts have maintained that a publicly
announced intention to acquire control of a company followed by a rapid accumulation
of that firm’s stock is a tender offer.18
Reason for Using a Tender Offer
While we discuss tender offers in this chapter within the context of hostile deals, it is
importanttobearinmindthattenderoffersareutilizedinconsensual,non-hostiledeals.
One of the reasons a tender offer might be used in a friendly deal is that it may provide
the benefit of a faster deal completion than other alternatives.

Takeover Tactics
If a bidder believes that it will not be able to receive the support of the target’s board
and senior management, it may resort to a tender offer. In using a tender offer, the bidder
may be able to circumvent management and the target’s board and obtain control even
when the target’s board opposes the takeover. The costs associated with a tender offer,
such as legal filing fees as well as publicity and publication costs, make the tender offer a
more expensive alternative than a negotiated deal. The initiation of a tender offer often
means that the company will be taken over, although not necessarily by the firm that
initiatedthetenderoffer.Thetenderoffermayputthecompanyinplay,whichmaycause
it to be taken over by another firm that may seek to enter the bidding contest for the
target. The auction process may significantly increase the cost of using a tender offer.
It also tends to increase the returns enjoyed by target shareholders.
The tender offer can have the advantage of speed in that it is theoretically possible to
complete a cash tender offer in 20 business days. Practically, there are defenses, such as
the poison pill or right plan, that the target may deploy to derail and slow down the ten-
der offer. Practically, once a poison pill has been deployed, the tender offer is temporarily
stymied and the bidder must then pursue a proxy contest to change the board, which,
in turn, can allow the tender offer to proceed.
A tender offer also shows the target’s shareholders and its board the resolve the
bidder has to complete a deal. It also can serve as a device for showing the intentions of
the target’s shareholders. This is important, because when the offer is made public the
compositionofthetarget’sshareholderbaseoftenchanges,withlong-termshareholders
often selling out to short-term investors, who are eager to receive a takeover premium.
Such short-term shareholders may be reluctant to support entrenched target managers
who oppose any sale of the company.

companies was 55% on a weighted average basis.19 The targets that were not acquired
by a bidder either went to a white knight or remained independent. White knights
accounted for a significant percentage of the instances in which targets fought off the
original hostile bidder. Bidders have to take into account the fact that approximately
half of the contested deals will be unsuccessful from their perspective when they launch
a hostile bid. We have to also keep in mind that in this discussion we are defining
success as being able to ultimately take over the target that is resisting the offer. We are
not defining success as an eventual takeover and a deal that is also a financial success
based on years of profitable, posttakeover performance. If this were done, the success
rate would be lower.
Regulatory Considerations and Choice of a Tender Offer
When the target is in an industry that is highly regulated, then the deal closing may be
held up until regulatory approval is secured. Practically, this could mean that the tender
offer could be open for a long time period, such as nine months or more. A lot can happen
in that long a time period, such as a new bidder coming on the scene, which may make
the tender offer a less attractive way to complete a takeover. This is because sharehold-
ers will only tender their shares when all the conditions, such as receiving regulatory
approvals, have been met. When regulatory approvals are going to be a major issue,
a more attractive method would be a basic one-step merger in which the deal becomes
effective when shareholder approval is received. The target can schedule a shareholder
meeting in the near future, such as three months, and once shareholders vote in favor of
the deal, the fiduciary is no longer in play and the deal cannot be interrupted by a third
party while we wait for the regulatory approvals that may take many more months to
secure.
Cash versus Securities Tender Offers
The firm that is initiating a tender offer may go with an all-cash tender offer or may
use securities as part or all of the consideration used for the offer. Securities, such as the
bidder’s own shares, may be more attractive to some of the target stockholders because
under certain circumstances the transaction may be considered tax-free. When the bid-
der uses its own shares, this is sometimes referred to as an exchange offer.
The bidding firm may create a more flexible structure for target shareholders by
using a double-barreled offer, which is an offer in which the target shareholders are
given the option of receiving cash or securities in exchange for their shares. If securities
are used in the transaction, they must be registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933. The securities must also be issued
in compliance with the relevant state’s blue sky laws, which regulate the issuance and
transfer of securities.
The SEC review process may also slow down the tender offer. The acquiring firm is
encumbered by the waiting periods of the Williams Act and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
19 Mergerstat Review, 2017.

Takeover Tactics
(see Chapter 3). The use of securities may add another waiting period while the firm
awaits the SEC review. The SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance has designed a system of
selective review whereby it responds to repeat issuers more expeditiously. This system
permits only a brief review of firms that may have already gone through a thorough
review process for prior issues of securities. In these cases, the securities registration and
review process may present few or no additional delays beyond the Williams Act and
Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting periods.
Research on hostile bids shows that cash is more likely to be offered as a means of
payment in hostile offers. This is an intuitive result not only because of the aforemen-
tioned time-related advantages of cash offers over securities bids, but also because cash
deals may be more appealing to target shareholders, even though they may bring with
them adverse tax consequences.
10-Day Window of the Williams Act—13D
As noted in Chapter 3, the Williams Act requires that purchasers of 5% of the outstand-
ing shares of a company’s stock register with the SEC within 10 days by filing a Schedule
13D. The filing of this schedule notifies the market of the purchaser’s intentions and
alerts stockholders to an impending tender offer. It is in the bidder’s interest to purchase
shares as quickly as possible during the 10-day period after the acquirer reaches the 5%
threshold. If the bidder is able to purchase securities during this period, the stock price
may be lower than it would be following the notification to the market of the bidder’s
intentions. The filing gives the stockholders notice that a bidder may be about to make
a bid. This implies a dramatic increase in the demand for the securities and makes them
more valuable. Stockholders will demand a higher price to part with their stock, know-
ing that an upcoming bid and its associated premium may be forthcoming. The 10-day
window gives the bidder an opportunity to purchase a larger amount of stock with-
out having to pay the post-filing premium—assuming, however, that rumors have not
already anticipated the content of the filing. It is difficult to purchase large amounts of
stock and keep the identity of the purchaser secret.
The 10-day window may be turned into a 12-day window if the initial purchases
are made on a Wednesday. This would require the purchaser to file on a Saturday. The
SEC usually allows the purchaser to file on the next business day, which would be two
days later, on Monday.
Response of the Target Management
SEC Rule 14e-2(a) requires that the target issues its response to the bid no later than 10
business days after the offer commenced. This response is done through the filing of a
Schedule 14D-9. In its response, the target basically has four options:
1. Recommend acceptance.
2. Recommend rejection.
3. State that it has no opinion and is neutral.
4. State that it cannot take a position on the bid.

Tender Offers
◾
251
In evaluating its response, the target’s board has to keep in mind that its stockhold-
ers often view tender offers as a favorable development because they tend to bring high
offer premiums. Nonetheless, the appropriate response of the target company’s manage-
ment is not always clear. If resistance will increase shareholder returns, then this may
be a more appropriate course of action. Such resistance might be used as leverage to try
to get the bidder to increase its offer. This assumes, however, that the company believes
that an increased offer is more advantageous than the gains that shareholders could
realize if the company remained independent.
By resisting the bid, the target may be able to force the bidder to raise its offer.
The target may also be able to attract other bidders to start an auction process. We
have seen that the winners of such auctions are often afflicted with the winner’s curse,
which works to the target shareholders’ advantage. Multiple bidders usually translate
into higher premiums and somewhat greater leverage for the target.
One risk that the target bears when it resists the bid is that the bid may be with-
drawn. If the premium offered reflects a value that is in excess of that which could be
realized for shareholders by keeping the company independent, then resistance reduces
value. Each takeover contest is different, and different circumstances apply. If the tar-
get’s independence presents lower value for its own shareholders, but synergistic gains
mean that the target is much more valuable when combined with the bidder, then it
would seem that there should be a basis for a sale at a premium that is attractive for
target shareholders.
Whenevaluatingthelevelofresistance,targetmanagersneedtoassesstheiroptions
well in advance of an actual bid. If the target’s board and management believe that the
companywouldbeanattractivetarget,theymayinstalldefensesinadvanceofanybidso
that the company cannot be acquired at values less than what they believe the company
is worth. The installation of such defenses conveys information to the market that the
target may not be receptive to a hostile offer. If the target has already fought off prior
hostile bids, this is also additional information for the market. It is difficult for any target
board and management team to take the position that no offer, no matter how high,
would be acceptable. However, there are cases where managers may not explicitly say
the company would never be for sale at any price, but where their intentions seem to
convey that view. Obviously, this is not in shareholders’ interests.
Creation of a Tender Offer Team
The bidding firm assembles its team of essential players and coordinates its actions
throughout the tender offer process. The team may be composed of the following
members outside the corporation’s own management and in-house counsel:
◾
Investment bank. The investment bank will play a key role in providing the requi-
site financing and advisory services through the tender offer. The investment bank
may provide bridge financing, which allows the bidder to “buy now and pay later.”
It also may ultimately finance the bid by issuing securities such as junk bonds or
through securing loan agreements. The investment bank’s merger expertise is most

◾
Legal advisors. Attorneys who are knowledgeable in the tactics and defenses
employed to evade tender offers may be an invaluable source of advice, both legal
and strategic, for the bidder. Starting in the 1990s, a larger number of law firms
began to play prominent roles in merger and acquisition advising in the United
States. This differed from the 1980s, when two law firms dominated this market.
◾
Information agent. The information agent is typically one of the major proxy solicit-
ing firms. The information agent is responsible for forwarding tender offer materials
to stockholders. Proxy firms may also actively solicit the participation of stockhold-
ers in tender offers by means of a telephone and mail campaign.
◾
Depository bank. The depository bank handles the receipt of the tender offers and the
payment for the shares tendered. The bank makes sure that shares have been prop-
erly tendered. An ongoing tabulation is kept for the bidder, allowing the probability
of success to be determined throughout the tender offer.
◾
Forwarding agent. The bidder may decide to retain a forwarding agent in addition to
the depository bank. The forwarding agent enhances the resources of the depository
bank and transmits tenders received to the depository bank. A forwarding agent is
particularly useful when there is a concentration of shares in a given area that is
not well serviced by the depository bank.
Two-Tiered Tender Offers
A two-tiered tender offer is sometimes referred to as a front end–loaded tender offer. It
provides superior compensation, such as cash or stock, for a first-step purchase, and is
followed by inferior compensation, such as subordinated debentures, which often have
a less certain value, for the second tier or the back end of the transaction. The two-tiered
offer process normally starts with an actual offer combined with a notice of an intention
to complete a back-end freeze-out transaction. The technique is often designed to exert
pressure on stockholders who are concerned that they may become part of a second tier
and that they may receive inferior compensation if they do not tender early enough to
become part of the first tier. If sufficient shares are tendered in the first tier and if the
merger or acquisition is approved, the remaining shareholders can be “frozen out” of
their positions and may have to tender their shares for the inferior compensation. The
compensation for the two tiers may be broken down into a first-tier, all-cash offer at
a higher price for 51% of the target and a second-tier offer at a lower price that may
provide noncash compensation, such as debentures. The noncash compensation in the
form of debentures is often considered inferior when its value is less clear and less exact
relative to cash consideration. The two-tiered pricing strategy is often considered coer-
cive to stockholders because it attempts to stampede them into becoming part of the
first tier.

able but fear being caught in the back-end tier, so they rush to tender their shares.

Regulation of Two-Tiered Tender Offers
Those who oppose the two-tiered bid maintain that it is too coercive and unfair to share-
holders in the second tier, who are entitled to equal treatment under the Williams Act.
Two-tiered offers may be coercive in that shareholders in the front end receive better
compensation than back-end shareholders. Although courts have ruled that two-tiered
tender offers are not illegal per se, calls for horizontal equity—equal treatment for all
shareholders—gave rise to changes in state corporation laws. In many states these
statutes have been amended to try to bring about equitable treatment for all tendering
shareholders. These amendments included fair price provisions and redemption rights.
Regulation of two-tiered offers has occurred through formal laws but also infor-
mally through market forces. For example, fair price provisions that were introduced to
corporate charters required that all shareholders, even those in the second tier, receive a
fair price. This price may be equal to the prices paid to the first-tier shareholders. In addi-
tion, redemption rights may allow shareholders to redeem their shares at a price similar
to the price paid to the first tier. Jarrell and Poulsen have reported a dramatic rise in the
adoption of fair price provisions in corporate charters in response to the increased use
of front end–loaded offers.20 They found that 354 adoptions of fair price amendments
took place between 1983 and 1984, which is in sharp contrast to the total of 38 amend-
ments passed between 1979 and 1982. Jarrell and Poulsen attribute this increase to the
greater incidence of two-tiered bids in the early 1980s. These corporate charter amend-
ments, begun in earnest in the 1980s, however, combined with the passage of specific
state laws, have limited the effectiveness of two-tiered bids. Indeed, while the Williams
Act allowstwo-tiered tenderoffers, the regulationof suchpotentially coercivetacticshas
been limited by state laws. In particular, the Delaware Supreme Court has maintained a
consistent opposition to takeovers it determines are coercive. It has done so by allowing
some aggressive antitakeover measures taken by target boards.21
Market forces also have dealt with what some consider to be the negative, coercive
aspects of two-tiered bids. Competitive bidders can take advantage of the inferior com-
pensation given to back-end shareholders to offer a more attractive any-and-all tender
offer. Not surprisingly, in their analysis of 210 tender offers, Comment and Jarrell found
that not only were two-tiered bids relatively rare in their sample but also that share-
holders fared as well in any-and-all offers as they did in two-tiered bids.22 That is, they
found “average total premiums actually received by shareholders differ insignificantly
in executed two-tiered and any-and-all tender offers.”23
In Europe, tender offer regulations are somewhat similar to the United States but
may impose additional restrictions on the bidder. For example, in England, a bidder
who owns 30% or more of a company’s voting outstanding shares must make an offer
for all of the remaining shares at the highest price it paid to acquire its stock position.

This renders partial bids and two-tiered offers ineffective. Bidders who acquire 51%
of the outstanding shares cannot require a freeze-out of minority shareholders, as is
possible in the United States.
Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Tender Offers
One of the early studies that comprehensively focused on the shareholder wealth effects
of tender offers was conducted by Asquith as an outgrowth of his doctoral dissertation
at the University of Chicago.24 Asquith examined 211 successful and 91 unsuccessful
merger bids between 1962 and 1976 and considered the impact of the bids on daily
excess returns to stockholders in the affected companies. Daily excess returns reflect
stock returns that are in excess of that which would be expected by the stock’s risk level
as measured by its Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic or diversifiable risk. This concept
is covered in most corporate finance textbooks.
Asquith’s results indicate a strong positive cumulative excess return for targets of
successful bids when considering a 60-day window before and after the offer. It is inter-
esting that the market was efficient in anticipating the offer, as reflected by the fact that
most of the nearly 20% cumulative excess return was reached before the announcement
date (press day). Unsuccessful targets lose most of their almost 10% gains by the end of
the 60-day period after the announcement.
According to Asquith, acquiring firms in successful bids experience relatively small
gains that persist 60 days after the takeover. Those potential acquirers in unsuccessful
takeovers display a 25% cumulative excess return 60 days after the attempted takeover.
The Asquith study was published over three decades ago. However, its basic find-
ings regarding the wealth effects of tender offers on bidders still are somewhat relevant
to today’s M&A market. Later research, such as that of Loughran and Vijh as well as by
Rau and Vermaelen, has shown that these initial responses may not always be indica-
tive of the long-term performance of the bidder.25 One explanation for the positive initial
stock market response is that bidders and the market may perceive tender offer targets
to be undervalued and thus good buys. Perhaps these targets are companies that have
been poorly managed and do not trade at prices consistent with their potential values.
However, we have seen that over time, the performance of these bidders for these compa-
nies tends to erode. Indeed, Rau and Vermaelen have identified one group of bidders in
particular who tend to do progressively poorly over time. These are what they refer to as
glamour firms. They define glamour firms to be firms with low book-to-market ratios. The
low book-to-market ratios imply that the market may be keen on these firms and they
may trade at “popular” values, but these values are not reflected in the book value of
their assets. They theorize that managers of such glamour companies, perhaps afflicted
by hubris enhanced by the glamour status, may overestimate their ability to manage the

Wealth Effects of Unsuccessful Tender Offers
Although the premium associated with a successful bid may increase the target share-
holder’s wealth, the question exists whether the increase in the target’s shares caused by

256
◾
Takeover Tactics
the announcement of a bid persists when the bid fails. An early study by Bradley, Desai,
and Kim analyzed the returns to stockholders by firms that either received or made
unsuccessful control-oriented tender offers between 1963 and 1980.26 They defined a
control-oriented tender offer as one in which the bidding firm holds less than 70% of the
target’s shares and is attempting to increase its holdings by at least 15%. They consid-
ered a total of 697 tender offers. This study measured the impact of the tender offers by
examining the cumulative abnormal returns to both the target and the bidding firm.
Target
The results show that target shareholders realize positive abnormal returns surround-
ing the month of the announcement of the tender offer. They found that the cumulative
abnormal returns reflected a positive response which did not go away in the event that
the bid was rejected.27 In their total sample of unsuccessful tender offers, 76.8% of the
firms were taken over and 23.2% were not. A review of Figure 6.5 shows that this posi-
tive effect is the case for those that are eventually taken over, whereas it is very different
for those that are not taken over.

Bidder
The Bradley study reveals interesting results regarding the impact of tender offers on
acquiring firms. As Figure 6.6 shows, the cumulative abnormal returns for bidding firms
remain nonnegative when the target is independent and there is no change in control.
When another bidder acquires the target and the bidder in question loses the tender
offer, the value of the bidding firm falls significantly. Bradley and colleagues interpret
this effect as the market’s perception that the bidding firm has lost an opportunity to
acquire a valuable resource. This effect is sometimes caused by competitors acquiring
resources that will provide a competitive advantage over the firm that lost the bid.
The Bradley et al. study traced the time frame for the wealth effects on unsuccess-
ful bidders and found that, for their sample of tender offers between 1963 and 1980,
the average gap between the announcement of the unsuccessful bid and the subsequent
successful tender offer was 60.6 days. Almost all the decline in the value of a portfolio
of successful bidding firms had occurred by day 21. The value of the portfolio declined
2.84% by day 21.
Tender Offer Premiums and Director Independence
Independent directors are those who are not employees and who do not have any other
relationship with the corporation. Finance theorists have long contended that the more

258
◾
Takeover Tactics
independent a board is, the greater the return to shareholders.28 Cotter, Shivdasani,
and Zenner studied 169 tender offers between 1989 and 1992.29 Their results sup-
ported Fama and Jensen’s hypothesis. They found that targets of tender offers experience
shareholder gains that are 20% higher when the board is independent compared with
less independent tender offer targets. They also found that bid premium revisions were
also higher when the board was more independent. These findings suggest that inde-
pendent directors are more active supporters of shareholder value than nonindependent
directors. Cotter and colleagues extended their research to determine the source of the
increased shareholder gains. Their results suggest that the higher target gains come at
the expense of returns to bidder shareholders. This conclusion is consistent with other
studies that we discuss throughout this book.
Takeover Premiums and Shareholders’ Investment Horizons
Over time, shares have been increasingly controlled by institutional investors. However,
suchinvestorscanhavedifferentinvestmenthorizons,withsomebeingmoreshort-term
oriented and others having a longer investment horizon and average holding period.
Theoretically, short-term investors, such as some mutual funds, may have less incentive
to monitor management compared to longer-term investors, such as those who control
shares in employee benefit plans. Short-term investors may also have less incentive to
hold out for a higher takeover premium.
Using a sample of 3,814 takeover events over the period 1980–1999, Gaspar,
Massa, and Matos found that targets whose shareholders own their shares for an
average of less than four months received 3% lower takeover premiums compared to
shareholders with longer investment horizons.30 They also found that “short-term
shareholder” companies had worse returns around the takeover announcement while
also exhibiting lower long-term returns. These results lend support to the proposition
that the more that the shareholder base is composed of short-term shareholders, the
more leeway management has to pursue their own personal benefits at the expense of
shareholders’ gains—a view that has been discussed by other researchers.31
From a tactical perspective, this research has several important ramifications for
bidders (and targets). Target companies that have more short-term shareholders may be
less expensive to acquire. They also may put forward less resistance and their manage-
ment may be more willing to trade personal benefits in exchange for lower premiums for
shareholders. This partly explains why investment bankers and merger advisory firms
representing bidders do a shareholder analysis prior to launching a bid.
It is important to note that the findings we have discussed are generalizations that,
while they have intuitive appeal and are consistent with research findings, may apply

in some cases and not in others. These findings also are drawn from a time period that
precedes the proliferation of activist hedge funds.
Do CEOs Trade Premium for Power?
CEOs who do not want to lose their positions in control of the target may be willing to
accept a lower premium for shareholders in exchange for positions of influence in the
combined company. Julie Wolf analyzed a sample of 53 mergers of equals over the period
1991–1999.32 She found that target shareholder returns were negatively correlated
to target representation on the combined company’s board. That is, when the merger
agreement provided for target management or directors to receive a directorship in the
combined company, they may have been less likely to negotiate for a higher premium for
their shareholders.
Are “Bad Bidders” More Likely to Become Targets?
The impact of poor acquisitions was discussed in Chapter 4 in the context of conglomer-
ate or diversification mergers that performed poorly. It was also discussed in Chapter 2
in the context of the acquisitions that occurred in the third merger wave. The issue of
how a firm is affected by a poor acquisition is of interest to stockholders in the bidding
firm as they consider whether they should favor a certain acquisition.
In 1988, Mitchell and Lehn analyzed the effects of poor acquisitions on acquiring
firms.33 They found that the probability of becoming a takeover target was inversely
related to the cumulative average returns associated with the firm’s acquisitions. They
used a logistic regression, which is an econometric technique in which the dependent
variable may vary between 0 and 1. In this case, the 0 or 1 represents the probability of
whether a firm became a target. Some studies of the impact of acquisitions on acquiring
firms show a zero or negative impact while providing clear benefits for the target
firm. Mitchell and Lehn contend that the market differentiates between good and bad
acquiring firms. Although they found returns to acquirers to be approximately zero,
they observed that subsamples of good acquirers outperformed acquiring firms that
pursued failed acquisition strategies, or what Mitchell and Lehn refer to as bad bidders.
For example, as shown in Figure 6.7, acquiring firms that did not subsequently become
targets themselves showed clearly positive returns over a 60-day window around the
acquisition announcement. Acquiring firms that became targets of either friendly
or hostile acquisitions showed clearly negative returns. In other words, acquisitions
by companies that become targets, especially hostile targets, cause the acquiring
company’s stock price to fall, whereas acquisition by companies that do not become
targets results in an increase in the acquiring firm’s stock price.
Mitchell and Lehn’s explanation for the returns depicted in Figure 6.6 is twofold.
Acquiring companies that become targets make acquisitions that the market expects

will reduce the combined profitability of these companies. That is, the market is saying
that this is a bad acquisition. The second possible explanation for this phenomenon is
that the acquiring company is overpaying for the target. It could be that at some lower
price the acquisition would be a better one.
The authors of this study went on to trace the relationship between the acquisitions
and subsequent divestitures. They found a statistically significantly negative stock price
response (average of 24%) to acquisitions that were subsequently divested. For acqui-
sitions that were not divested, they found a small, not statistically significant, positive
stock price response (average of 1.9%). The importance of this result is that it seems
that at the time of the acquisition announcement, the market is making a prediction
regarding which acquisitions are good and which are bad. Mitchell and Lehn’s analysis
suggests that the market is an efficient predictor of the success of acquisitions.
ADVANTAGES OF TENDER OFFERS OVER OPEN MARKET
PURCHASES
Open market purchases may at first seem to provide many advantages over tender offers.
Forexample,theydonotinvolvethecomplicatedlegalrequirementsandcostsassociated

be legally interpreted as a tender offer.) The costs of a tender offer may be far higher
than the brokerage fees incurred in attempting to take control through open market

purchases of the target’s stock. As noted previously, Smiley estimated that the total cost
of tender offers averaged approximately 13% of the post–tender offer market price of the
target’s shares.34
Open market purchases also have clear drawbacks that are not associated with
tender offers. A bidder who purchases shares in the open market is not guaranteed
that he will be able to accumulate sufficient shares to acquire clear control. If 51%
clear control is not achieved, the bidder may become stuck in an undesirable minority
position. One advantage of a tender offer is that the bidder is not bound to purchase
the tendered shares unless the desired number of shares has been tendered. The bidder
who becomes mired in a minority position faces the following alternatives:
◾
Do a tender offer for additional shares. In this case, the bidder incurs the tender offer
expenses in addition to the costs of the open market purchasing program.
◾
Begin a proxy fight. This is another costly means of acquiring control, but the bidder,
after having already acquired a large voting position, is now in a stronger position
to launch a proxy fight.
◾
Sell the minority stock position. These sales would place significant downward
pressure on the stock price and may result in significant losses.
Large-scale open-market purchases are also difficult to keep secret. Market partici-
pants regard the stock purchases as a signal that a bidder may be attempting to make
a raid on the target. This may then change the shape of the target’s supply curve for
its stock by making it more vertical above some price.35 This can make a street sweep
effective but expensive. Other shareholders may also have the idea that a higher price
may be forthcoming and may be reluctant to sell unless a very attractive offer is made.
This threshold price may be quickly reached as the available supply of shares on the
market, which may be relatively small compared with the total shares outstanding,
becomes exhausted. As stockholders come to believe that a bid may be forthcoming,
they have an incentive to hold out for a higher premium. The holdout problem does
not exist in tender offers because the bidder is not obligated to purchase any shares
unless the amount requested has been tendered. If the requested amount has not been
tendered at the end of the expiration date of the offer, the bidder may cancel the offer or
extend it.
A street sweep may be more effective when a bidder is able to locate large blocks
of stock in the hands of a small group of investors. In cases in which there have been
offers for the company or speculation about impending offers, stock often becomes con-
centrated in the hands of arbitragers. Although these investors are often eager to sell,
they will often do so only at a high price. The existence of large blocks of stock in the
hands of arbitragers may enable a bidder to amass a significant percentage of the target’s
stock, perhaps enough to gain effective control of the company, but only if the bidder is

Arbitragers and Takeover Tactics
Theoretical risk-less arbitrage can occur when two identical assets are bought/sold at
different prices. The opportunity for a risk-less profit can occur if the investor sells a
higher-priced asset while simultaneously buying the identical asset at a lower price.
Such investment activity may facilitate the “law of one price,” where the buying of
investors raises the price of the lower-priced asset while the selling activity does the
opposite. However, this is not the type of arbitrage that occurs in M&A.
Risk arbitragers are firms that accumulate shares of companies that are targeted
for acquisitions. Their investment strategy is basically a gamble that a given transac-
tion will close. If a given deal is completed, arbitragers will profit from the difference
between the purchase price and the takeover price. The arbitrager may also hedge its
investment by selling the acquirer’s stock short. In fact, the short sale is really what
makes the transaction arbitrage rather than simple speculation that a merger will close.
The most famous, or really infamous, arbitrager was Ivan Boesky, who in the 1980s was
the most well-known practitioner of this craft. However, while he claimed the success he
enjoyed from merger arbitrage came from his ability to judge the dealmakers themselves,
he really purchased insider information from investment bankers, such as Martin Siegel
of Kidder Peabody.
Arbitragers may provide a service or benefit to target shareholders, as they can sell
their shares soon after an offer is made and, in doing so, eliminate their risk that the deal
will not be completed. That deal completion risk is then transferred to the arbitragers.36
Arbitragers and Target Vulnerability
From a bidder’s perspective, if many “long-term” target shareholders sell out to
“short-term” arbitragers, this is a positive development. Arbitragers will assess the bid
and the vulnerability of the target. If they believe the bid is credible and the prospect
of success is good, they may buy the stock with an eye toward realizing a premium
from the acquisition. This then makes the company more vulnerable. If, however, the
arbitragers are not convinced the deal will go through, perhaps through concern about
the bidder and also the resolve and defensive capabilities of the target, they may hold
off on buying shares lest they get stuck without a profitability investment exit strategy.
Thus, it is in the interest of the bidder and the target to convince arbitragers of the
strength of their respective positions.
Arbitragers can act quickly. In fact, if they are convinced the bid is credible, it is
in their interest to act quickly before the price rises. Therefore, if only a relatively small
percentageofthetarget’sshares,suchas5%–10%,issoldtoarbitragersatthestartofthe
bid, then this is a good sign for the target and bad for the bidder. However, if arbitragers

acquire a large percentage of the target’s shares, things look much more promising from
the bidder’s perspective.
Computing Arbitrage Returns
A simple expression of a risk arbitrager’s annualized return (RAR) is shown in
equation 6.4:
RAR = GSS∕I × (365∕IP)
(6.4)
where:
RAR = risk arbitrage return
GSS = gross stock spread
I = investment by arbitrager
IP = investment period (days between investment and closing date)
The gross stock spread is shown in equation 6.5:
GSS = OP −MP
(6.5)
where:
OP = offer price
MP = market price
As an example, assume that Company A makes a $50-per-share offer for Company
B, which now trades at $45 per share. The gross stock spread is $5. Also assume that
the deal is expected to close in 90 days. If the deal closes, then the risk arbitrager’s return
would be as follows:
RAR = ($50 −$45)∕$45 × (365∕90)
= 0.451 or 45.1%
This is an impressive annualized return. Practitioners in this area wish the reality
of this business were as lucrative and simple as the preceding example. In effect, the
annualization process assumes reinvestment at that rate. In addition, it closes its eyes to
all the risks, which can lead to significant losses.
Arbitragers have to consider a variety of risk factors when they evaluate takeovers
that they are gambling will be completed. A host of different factors can halt a deal.
These include the defensive actions of the target but also regulatory factors, such as
gaining antitrust approval. As we discussed in Chapter 3, for companies that have a
significant international business, such as in Europe as well as in the United States,
they must get antitrust approval of both the United States and the European Union
antitrust authorities. In addition, some deals may take a number of months before they

264

Takeover Tactics
close. The arbitrager’s gain comes from the premium that will be received if the deal is
completed. For deals that take an extended time to complete, arbitragers have to also
consider dividends that will be paid on the shares during the waiting period.
In spite of a surge in M&A volume in 2014, event-driven hedge funds, funds that
make bets on M&As as well as other events, on average did poorly. Some funds that
invested in tax inversion deals (discussed in Chapter 16), such as AbbVie’s proposed
merger with Shire, lost hundreds of millions of dollars. This underscores the risks inher-
ent in M&A investing.
Simple Example of Risk Arbitrage in M&A
Let’s assume that the Target has been trading at $19 (Pt = $19) and that the Acquirer
has been trading in the range of $15 prior to the Acquirer’s announcement of an
exchange offer for the Target. The Acquirer offered two of its shares for one of the target.
Based on the nice premium relative to the announcement price ($30 – $19 = $11), it
was not surprising that the Target’s shares rose sharply to $24 on the announcement,
while the Acquirer’s shares fell to $13.
Let’s further assume an Arbitrager buys 100 shares of the Target for $24 per
shares. If the Arbitrager were to simply hold these shares until a possible closing, that
really would not be arbitrage, as arbitrage requires the simultaneous buying and selling
of the same asset at different prices. So let’s also assume that the Arbitrager sells 200
shares short at $13 per share (200 because that is what will be ultimately exchanged for
the 100 target shares if the deal goes through). The profit of the Arbitrager is as follows:
Buy 100 shares Target @ $24/share
($2,400)
Sell 200 shares Acquirer @ $13/share
2,600
Proﬁt
$200
If the deal eventually closes as planned, in 150 days the Arbitrager will receive 200
shares of the Acquirer, which will offset the 200 shares it sold short, thus closing out the
position, as the shares in the long position that were received were used to deliver shares
to the counterparty in the short transaction. At that point the Arbitrager has neither a
long nor a short position but a profit of $200. The arbitrager’s annualized return then
is as follows:
$200∕$2,400 × 365∕150 = 0.202, or 20.2%
This is a very impressive return due to the assumptions we built into the example.
The annualization process is used to create an annual return, which can be used to com-
pare the rate from this investment activity with other investment activities. However, it
would be naive to believe that this return over that 150-day period could necessarily be
duplicated. We also conveniently closed our eyes to the possibility that the deal might
not have closed and that the Arbitrager would be stuck with the shares of the Target
that might sell at a lower price than what was paid for them; the Arbitrager would still
have to make good on its obligations to the counterparty on the share sale, having not
gotten the 200 shares of the Acquirer since the deal did not close.

Advantages of Tender Offers Over Open Market Purchases
◾
265
The example was also simplistic in that it assumed that there was no dividend
income received from the long position nor were there any dividend-related obligations
related to the short position. If both companies paid dividends over the investment
period, this would provide both dividend income on the long position and an obligation
for the Arbitrager to pay the dividend on the short position.
It also assumed that the Arbitrager could not earn any interest income by depositing
the monies received from the short sale with a brokerage firm that was also willing to pay
the Arbitrager an interest income. However, brokerage firms often are reluctant to pay
interest on short sales.
In our example, we also assume that the shares offered were fixed and there was
not a collar agreement. We will discuss collar agreements in Chapter 15, but for now let
us note that such an agreement provides that the shares offered could go up or down,
depending on the performance of the Acquirer’s shares in the marketplace. Such an
agreement reduces the risk for the Target’s shareholders, although it makes our return
calculation more uncertain.
Arbitrage Returns Research
Research has shown that arbitragers often enjoy attractive returns. For example,
Dukes, Frohlich, and Ma found average daily returns of 0.5%, which translated to
holding period returns of 25%.37 Their average arbitrage holding period was 52 days.
Later research by Jindra and Walkling examined the arbitrage spreads in 362 cash
tender offers over the period 1981–1995.38 They found that the average spread was
2%. They also found that the spreads were greater when the takeover contest was
longer and were smaller in hostile deals. They found that monthly return based on
the difference in the stock price one day after a bid was announced and the day the
bid was resolved was 2%. This translated to returns in excess of 25%. Karolyi and
Shannon analyzed 37 bids for 37 Canadian takeovers in 1997.39 They found an
average abnormal return from an arbitrage strategy was 5% on an average 57-day
investment period.
From the bidder’s perspective, the fact that shares become concentrated into the
hands of arbitragers is a positive development. These shareholders have no loyalty to
the target and actually want the deal to be completed. The greater their holdings, the
more the bidder can count on being able to readily purchase the necessary shares to
complete the deal.
Hsieh and Walkling analyzed the role that arbitragers played in takeover contests
and their outcomes. They analyzed 608 takeover bids during the period 1992–1999.40

They found that the holdings by arbitragers increased in bids that were more likely to
be successful. They also found that the changes in the holdings of arbitragers were pos-
itively correlated with the probability of the success of bids and their premiums. They
were also correlated with the likelihood of a later bid in instances where the initial bid
was canceled.

Arbitrage and Price Movements around M&A Announcements
Research has shown that the stock price of acquirers tends to decline, especially those
that use stock to finance bids, around the date of an announcement of an offer. Some-
times that decline can be so significant that it can cause the bidder to cancel its bid. This
happened in 2014 when 21st Century Fox canceled its $80 billion bid for Time Warner
Inc., in part due to the negative market reactions but also due to the strong opposition
from Time Warner.

was caused by the short-selling actions of arbitragers.42 Arbitragers will buy the target’s
shares, which puts upward price pressure on the target’s stock, while often selling that
bidder’s shares in an effort to lock in a specific gain. One of the interesting results of their
research was that they found these price effects were relatively short-lived.
Corporate Communications and Price Movements around M&A
Announcements
Financial research has confirmed what the market has long known—media reports
influence market trading and securities process.43 This is why companies invest
considerable sums in corporate communications. Ahern and Sosyura analyzed the
media coverage involving 507 mergers over the years 2000–2008.44 They found that
bidders who used equity to finance their M&As originated significantly more news
stories during the confidential merger negotiation period, which is prior to a public
announcement of a bid. Not only did the number of stories about the bidders increase,
but also the tone was more positive and there were fewer negative stories. Ahern and
Sosyura were able to show that these stories, which were typically a function of public
relations efforts by the bidders, paid off for these companies as they tended to cause the
bidder’s stock price to rise, thereby lowering the cost of the M&As.

Proxy Fights
◾
267
PROXY FIGHTS
A proxy fight is an attempt by a single shareholder or a group of shareholders to take
control or bring about other changes in a company through the use of the proxy mech-
anism of corporate voting. Proxy contests are political processes in which incumbents
and insurgents compete for shareholder votes through a variety of means, including
mailings, newspaper advertisements, and telephone solicitations. In a proxy fight, a bid-
der may attempt to use his voting rights and garner support from other shareholders to
oust the incumbent board and/or management. As noted, various federal and state reg-
ulations have limited the effectiveness of certain types of tender offers. However, courts
havebeenreluctanttosidewithdirectorswhoseektolimitshareholders’useoftheproxy
contest process.
It is useful to define some terms prior to continuing our discussion of proxy fights.
A proxy is a document, usually a card, that authorizes one individual to act on behalf of
another. The proxy card contains certain required and brief information regarding the
specific solicitation being made. The matter at issue is identified, and boxes are provided
for shareholders to designate their approval, disapproval, or abstention of each of the
matters highlighted on the card.
In a proxy fight proxy statements are issued. These are documents that provide
relevant information about a solicitation of shareholders that is being made. The proxy
statements contain more background information that is being put forward by the
solicitor to gain the support of the shareholders.
Regulation of Proxy Contests
The SEC regulates proxy contests, and its staff monitors the process to ensure that the
participants comply with proxy regulations. Proxy solicitations are made pursuant to
Section 14(a) of the 1934 Act and require that any solicitation be accompanied by the
information set forth in Schedule 14A. All materials that are used to influence the out-
comeofthecontestmustbesubmittedtotheSECexaminers10calendardaysinadvance
of any distribution of proxy materials. This includes newspaper announcements, mate-
rials being mailed to shareholders, and press releases. If the examiners find some of these
materials objectionable, they may require that the information be reworded or include
additional disclosure. If there are revisions of the proxy statements that constitute a sig-
nificant change in a prior proxy filing, a new 10-day period applies.
The writing in proxy fight proposals tends to be much more direct and heated than
what one normally finds in securities filings. The SEC allows this as a way for both par-
ties to get their message across to shareholders. Under Rule 14a-7 the corporation is
required to provide its shareholder list to the dissidents so that they can communicate
directly to shareholders.
Proxys & M&A
SEC rules require a proxy solicitation to be accompanied by a Schedule 14A. Item 14
of this schedule sets forth the specific information that must be included in a proxy

268
◾
Takeover Tactics
statement when there will be a vote for an approval of a merger, sale of substantial
assets, or liquidation or dissolution of the corporation. For a merger, this information
must include the terms and reasons for the transaction, as well as a description of the
accounting treatment and tax consequences of the deal. Financial statements and a
statement regarding relevant state and federal regulatory compliance are required.
Fairness opinions and other related documents also must be included. Preliminary
proxy statements related to mergers can be filed on a confidential basis, assuming they
are marked “Confidential, for Use of the Commission Only.”
Proxys and Insurgents
Rule 14a-8 provides shareholders with a mechanism to have their proposals included
in the company’s (the issuer’s) own proxy statement. This is a very cost-effective way
of getting their message to the shareholders. In order to qualify for this treatment, the
shareholders in question must hold at least $2,000 in market value or 1% of the issuer’s
voting shares for at least one year. They also can submit only one proposal a year.
In an effort to strike back against the use of proxy fights by insurgents, companies
sometimes petition the SEC to have it issue a no action letter. A no action letter disallows
a shareholder proposal. The SEC is empowered to do this under Section 14(a) 8 of the
Securities Exchange Act. Such a letter may be issued if it can be demonstrated that the
proposal is clearly not in the interests of other shareholders, serves only the personal
interests of its proponent, or is designed to redress a personal claim of grievance of the
shareholder.
Insurgents or nonmanagement activists must file a Schedule DFAN14A. This is a
form covering nonmanagement proxy solicitations not supported by the registrant (the
company). In this filing the insurgent indicates its investment position on the target and
the specific action it is considering taking. These activist filings sometimes contain enter-
taining reading. For example, in one such filing Carl Icahn included an “open letter to
shareholders of eBay” wherein he railed against management and the company’s CEO
and what he called the “Skype affair” in which he alleged that the company sold off
Skype at too low a price in a transaction that featured certain alleged conflicts he found
unacceptable.45

269
Proxy Fight Data
The number of proxy fights increased significantly over the period 2005–2009 and then
declined only to increase again in the years leading up to 2014 and then decline again.
(Figure 6.8). The rise in proxy contests over this period can be partly explained by the
number of aggressive activist hedge funds that have been using the proxy contest mech-
anism to bring about changes in undervalued companies that will raise the value of
shares they have purchased. To understand how such investors and others use proxy
contests to bring about changes in targets, and sometimes take total control of a target,
we need a basic understanding of the workings of the corporate election process.
Types of Proxy Contests
Typically, there are two main forms of proxy contests:
1. Contests for seats on the board of directors. An insurgent group of stockholders may
use this means to replace management. If the opposing slate of directors is elected,
it may then use its authority to remove management and replace them with a new
management team. In recent years we have seen insurgents who believe they may
lack the power to unseat directors try to organize a campaign to have shareholders
withhold their votes as a way of recording their disapproval.
2. Contests about management proposals. These proposals can be control proposals
relating to a merger or acquisition. Management may oppose the merger, and the
insurgent group of stockholders may be in favor. Other relevant proposals might be
the passage of antitakeover amendments in the company’s charter. Management
might be in favor, whereas the insurgent group might be opposed, believing that
its opposition will cause the stock price to fall and/or reduce the likelihood of
a takeover.

Proxy Contests: From the Insurgents’ Viewpoint
In a proxy contest, an insurgent group attempts to wrest control of the target by gath-
ering enough supporting votes to replace the current board with board members of the
group’s choosing. The following characteristics increase the likelihood that a proxy fight
will be successful:
◾
Insufficient voting support. Management normally can count on a certain percentage
of votes to support its position. Some of these votes might be through management’s
ownstockholdings.Aswehavenoted,managementcanusuallycountonthevoting
support of brokers who have not received specific instructions from shareholders.
Without a strong block of clear support for management among the voting share-
holders, management and the incumbent board may be vulnerable to a proxy fight.
◾
Poor operating performance. The worse the firm’s recent track record, the more likely
it is that other stockholders will vote for a change in control. Stockholders in a firm
that has a track record of declining earnings and a poor dividend record are more
likely to support an insurgent group advocating changes in the way the firm is
managed.
◾
Sound alternative operating plan. The insurgents must be able to propose changes that
other stockholders believe will reverse the downward direction of the firm. These
changes might come in the form of asset sales, with the proceeds paid to stockhold-
ers by means of higher dividends. Another possibility could be a plan that provides
for the removal of antitakeover barriers and a receptive approach to outside offers
for the sale of the firm.
Dead Shares Problem
Insurgents’ shareholders involved in a proxy process can find it a challenging experi-
ence with many of the advantages in the hands of management. For an insurgent to
effect a specific corporate action using a proxy contest, it must secure a majority of the
votes (if not a supermajority, in cases where the company has such a defense in place).
The insurgent may run into the problem of dead shares. All shares that are not delivered
by shareholders are, in effect, votes against the insurgent’s plan. The more apathetic
the target’s shareholders or the more shareholders who have sold their shares without
the underlying proxy after the record date, the more difficult it will be for the insurgent
to secure the requisite majority approval.
Concentration of Shares and Proxy Fight Success
A key element that often has a great impact on the success of a proxy fight is the distri-
bution of shares. If, for example, several activist hedge funds have amassed significant
equity positions in a vulnerable target, then an insurgent/activist may have a lot of lever-
age. If, however, employees or certain institutional investors who may be supportive of
management have large positions, it may be an uphill battle for the insurgent. Given
the importance of the distribution of shares, the insurgent will hire firms that specialize

in this work to advise them of the likelihood of winning an outright proxy fight. Usually,
however, the activist is able to achieve many of its goals without having to go ahead with
an actual proxy fight. Even the threat of an all-out battle will be enough to get valuable
concessions that may increase the value of the shares the activist purchased and will
serve as a mechanism for the activist to exit with a good return.
Effectiveness of Shareholder Activism
In 1989, Pound conducted a study of the effectiveness of shareholder activism by
examining various countersolicitations by shareholders who opposed management’s
antitakeover proposals. Pound analyzed a sample of 16 countersolicitation proxy fights
by shareholder groups that occurred in the 1980s. He reported the following results:46
◾
Countersolicitations were unsuccessful more often than they were successful.
Dissidents in Pound’s sample were successful only 25% of the time.
◾
When shareholders approved the contested provisions, the net-of-market share
values of the company dropped an average of 6%. The range of stock price reactions
was between 23% and 230%. Pound found that when the amendments were
defeated, stock prices rose.
◾
The majority of the countersolicitations that Pound examined were preceded by a
direct attempt to take control. In 8 of 16 countersolicitations in his sample, the dis-
sidents had made an outright offer to take control of the company. In another seven
cases, the dissidents had purchased a large stake in the firm. In only 1 of the 16
cases, was there no attempt to take control.
Pound’s study took place before the rise of the modern-day activist hedge funds. At
that time such funds may have been more of a corporate raider. The modern activist
hedge fund aggressively and actively usesthe proxy processmorethanitspriorcorporate
raider counterparts. Nonetheless, the Pound findings are largely still applicable.
Costs of a Proxy Fight
A proxy fight may be a less expensive alternative to a tender offer. Tender offers are costly
because they offer to buy up to 100% of the outstanding stock at a premium that may be
as high as 50%. In a tender offer, the bidder usually has certain stockholdings that may
be sold off in the event the tender offer is unsuccessful. The bidder may take a loss unless
there is an available buyer, such as a rival bidder or the target corporation. The stock
sales, however, may be a way for the bidder to recapture some of the costs of the tender
offer. Although a proxy fight does not involve the large capital outlays that tender offers
require, it is not without significant costs. The losers in a proxy fight do not have a way to
recapture their losses. If the proxy fight is unsuccessful, the costs of the proxy battle are

usually not recoverable. In a minority of circumstances, however, the insurgents may
recover their costs from the corporation.
The cost of conducting a proxy fight includes professional fees for the services of
proxy solicitors, investment bankers, and attorneys. Other costs include efforts to com-
municate with shareholders and seek to have them vote in favor of the insurgent or
activist. In addition, proxy fights often feature litigation, and this can add to the uncer-
tainty and the costs of the contest. It is ironic that the insurgent/activist has to pay its
own costs yet the company uses corporate resources to oppose the insurgent/activist,
even though they may be one of the largest shareholders in the company.
Role of Proxy Advisory Firms
Institutions, such as pension funds, mutual funds, endowments, and insurance com-
panies, are required by Department of Labor regulations to vote their shares. However,
these institutional investors own shares in many companies and the asset managers are
not in a position to closely monitor the corporate governance, or even sometimes the
financial performance, of all the companies they own stock in. They may have hundreds
of proxy proposals brought to them in a given year as shareholders in a diverse group
of companies. They are not set up to deal with these issues, and there is little economic
incentive for them to change the way they operate to properly address them. This has
given rise to a business known as proxy advisors.
There are two main proxy advisors—Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and
Glass Lewis and Co. The “industry” is basically a duopoly, and often the recommenda-
tions of these firms are blindly accepted by institutions. A question arises of whether this
works to the benefit of shareholders. It is not clear that it really does.
Current rules require only that institutional investors vote their shares and be able
to show that their votes are not conflicted. They can do this by merely adopting the
recommendations of proxy advisors. However, it is not clear that this works in share-
holders’ interests. Moreover, it is also not clear that the proxy advisory firms have the
resources and staffing to properly research all the companies they issue recommenda-
tions on.
When one considers all the institutions that use the two proxy advisors firms, it is
clear that they wield great influence on billions of dollars of equity. Yet the reality is that
they actually own no shares of the companies they issue recommendations on. Is this
appropriate? Is there a better system? If the business was more competitive, as opposed
to being a duopoly, there might be a little more assurance that the market would ensure
the quality of the work of these firms.
There is also another concern regarding ISS, which issues recommendation to
institutions on the corporate governance of companies while also selling corporate
governance consulting services to some of the companies it monitors. This raises the
issue of a conflict of interest? Do companies that hire ISS for corporate governance
consulting get unbiased recommendations or do their recommendations favor their
institutional clients?47
47 ISS itself was acquired in March 2014 by private equity firm Vestar Capital Partners. Glass Lewis is owned
by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board.

273
The SEC issues guidance that presses advisory firms to disclose conflicts. However,
not only is there need to disclose such conflicts but also there is a general concern that
these firms exercise too much influence on corporate governance. It is also important
to bear in mind that while the recommendations issued by proxy firms carry weight,
it is often the case that their recommendation are not followed. The larger investment
managers use information provided by such firms as only one input in their overall
decision-making process.
How Does the Market View the Recommendations of Proxy Advisory Firms?
Does the market place a lot of weight on the recommendations of the two major
proxy advisory companies? Larcker, McCall, and Ormazabal tested this using stock
option repricing proposals that would change (lower) the strike price of option holders,
typically managers, for their benefit.48 They looked at 272 stock option reprising
proposals over the period December 2004 through December 2009. These executive
compensation–like proposals are required by the SEC to be brought to shareholder
vote. Larker et al. tried to discern how much weight the market placed on such recom-
mendations by looking at the stock returns of companies that followed the restrictive
recommendations of two large proxy advisory firms—ISS and Glass Lewis. They
found that the more companies followed the ISS or Glass Lewis recommendations, the
lower their market value was. That is, companies that followed the recommendations
had lower market reactions than those that did not. They also had lower operating
performance and higher employee turnover. They conclude that “proxy advisory firm
recommendations were not value increasing for shareholders.”
Threshold for Bringing Proposals to Shareholders
Companies typically hold their annual meetings in April. Thus, this part of the year is
sometimes referred to as proxy season. Companies send out a proxy statement to share-
holders prior to the meeting. These statements delineate issues that will be addressed,
and perhaps voted on, at the shareholder meeting. They include the election of direc-
tors. In the United States all public companies have to file their proxy statements with
the SEC. As time has passed and the Internet has become a successful communication
medium, the SEC, under its Notice and Access Rule, has allowed public companies and
mutual funds to make the proxy materials available on a public website as opposed to
having to do expensive printing and mailings. The companies can send out a Notice
of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of the more expensive complete proxy
package that used to be required.
The communication and distribution of the proxy materials are often “subcontract-
ed” to a company that specializes in this work. In the United States, the leader in this
field is Broadridge Financial Solutions.
In 2013, there were more than 800 proxy proposals submitted to public companies.
These proxy proposals focus on a variety of issues, such as executive compensation,

ing,” Journal of Accounting and Economics 56, nos. 2–3 (2013): 149–169.

the capital structure and dividend payments of the company, and governance and
operations of the board. The shareholders submitting these proposals will request
that the company includes them in communications to shareholders and that they be
brought to a vote at the next shareholder meeting.
Currently, shareholders who have a $2,000 investment in a company have the right
to make a proxy request of the company, which the company has to expend resources to
respond to. Some believe that these requests, which by measurement cost a minimum of
$50,000 each to respond to, are a waste of corporate resources—especially since 93%
of the shareholder proposals that came to a vote at Fortune 250 companies in 2013
were denied.49 On the other hand, many U.S. companies, particularly on issues such as
executive compensation, have stonewalled shareholders and have even resisted reason-
able requests to allow shareholders, the owners of the company, to vote on whether the
compensation of managers is appropriate or excessive.
The $2,000 threshold is probably old and outdated. A higher threshold is probably
reasonable—especially in light of the obvious fact that if a shareholder is going to be
successful in opposing management and the current board, it should have the resources
to fund a successful proxy fight, and this will make financial sense only if they have a
significant investment in the company.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Proxy Contests
Early Research
Dodd and Warner conducted a study of 96 proxy contests for seats on the boards of
directors of companies on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange.50 Their research revealed a number of interesting findings on the impact of
proxy contests on the value of stockholders’ investments in these firms. They showed
that a positive stock price effect is associated with proxy contests. In a 40-day period
before and including the announcement of the proxy contest, a positive, abnormal
stock price performance of 0.105 was registered. Based on these results, Dodd and
Warner concluded that proxy contests result in an increase in value inasmuch as they
help facilitate the transfer of resources to more valuable uses.
The positive wealth effects of the Dodd and Warner study were confirmed in later
research by DeAngelo and DeAngelo.51 In a study of 60 proxy contests for board
seats, they found an average abnormal shareholder wealth increase equal to 4.85%
in a two-day window around the announcement of the dissident activity, whereas an
18.76% increase was associated with a 40-day window, which is the same time period
as that of the Dodd and Warner study. DeAngelo and DeAngelo traced the source of the
shareholder gains to cases in which the dissident activity led to the sale or liquidation
of the company.

panies,” Journal of Financial Economics 23 (June 1989): 29–60.

Proxy Fights
◾
275
DeAngelo and DeAngelo attempted to trace the source of the shareholder gains by
monitoring the firm for three years after the proxy fights. Fewer than 20% of the com-
panies remained independent and under the same management three years later. At
many of the companies, the CEO or president had resigned. In addition, at 15 of the
60 firms they studied, the companies were either sold or liquidated. They actually con-
cluded that many of the gains from proxy fights were related to merger and acquisition
activity. The proxy contests may have caused some of these firms to eventually sell the
company, which, in turn, caused shareholders to realize a takeover premium. This is
discussed further later in this chapter.
Later Research
A study by Borstadt and Zwirlein analyzed 142 companies that traded on the New York
and American Stock Exchanges over the period from 1962 to 1986.52 They learned that
dissidents were successful 42% of the time. They determined that shareholders realized
just over an 11% rate of return during the contest period. These positive shareholder
wealth effects are consistent with the bulk of research in this area, although one study,
by Ikenberry and Lakonishok, found negative effects.53
More recent research further confirmed the positive shareholder wealth effect of
prior studies. In a large study of 270 proxy contests that occurred between 1979 and
1994, Mulherin and Poulsen found that proxy contests help create shareholder value.54
They traced most of the gains to the acquisition of the firms that occurred around the
contest period. Gains were even found, however, when the company was not acquired,
if that firm experienced management turnover. They found that the new management
tended to engage in restructuring, which also created shareholder value. Either way,
the proxy contest helped remove poorly performing managers, thus raising shareholder
value.
In a study of 96 proxy contests involving merger votes over the period 2000–2006,
Yair Listokin found that dissident victories increased shareholder value.55 However,
when management prevailed, shareholder value suffered. These findings are quite
intuitive.
Hedge Fund Activists and the Success Rate of Proxy Contests
In Chapter 7, we discuss the rising importance of activist hedge funds who have become
the new corporate raiders. However, it is useful at this point to note that with the
rapid growth in assets of management by these funds, there has been a corresponding

increase in the number of activist campaigns. In addition, though, activists have
become more skilled at conducting these campaigns than their predecessors, who in
the past were better known by the term insurgents. Even recent academic research does
not fully capture the impact of these activists. However, over the years 2012–2015, the
success rate of proxy fights rose sharply to 95% in 2015 before falling back to 66% in
2016 (Figure 6.9).
Value of Shareholders’ Votes
The value of shareholders’ votes was also examined in the Dodd and Warner study. They
attempted to test the hypothesis originally proposed by Manne, which stated that a pos-
itive stock price effect in proxy fights is associated with the increased value of the votes
held by shareholders.56 This value is perceived by participants in the contest who lobby
for the support of shareholders. If their efforts are responsible for some of the increased
value of shares, the value should decline after the record date. Shares purchased after
the record date may be voted only under restricted and limited circumstances. For the
42 contests in which they had the specific record date, Dodd and Warner found negative
results, which seem to support the Manne vote-value hypothesis.
Nature of the Dissidents and Dissident Campaigns
Research shows that the dissidents are often former managers of the target or those who
have prior experience in the target’s line of business. The Dodd and Warner study found
that only a minority of the proxy contests involved a battle between an outside entity and
the target corporation. Almost half of the contests were waged between former insiders
56 Henry Manne, “The Higher Criticism of the Corporation,” Columbia Law Review 62 (1962): 399–432.

who left the company following a policy dispute or other disagreement. DeAngelo and
DeAngelo found that in almost 50% of the contests in their sample, the dissident leader
had prior experience in the target’s line of business. In almost one-third of the cases, the
dissident leader was at one time employed by the target company.
Long-Term Effects of Proxy Contests
The DeAngelo and DeAngelo study found that dissidents prevailed in one-third of the
contests in their sample, whereas another one-third of the companies had changes in
top management within three years of the contest, with most of these changes occurring
in the first year. In addition, they found that only 20% of the sample firms remained
independent, publicly held companies run by the same management team that was in
place before the proxy fight. In fact, one-quarter of the companies were either sold or
liquidated shortly after the contest.
One of the conclusions of the DeAngelo and DeAngelo study is that once a proxy
contest starts, it is more than likely that the company will not remain the same but will
undergo some significant changes. It is common that proxy contests result in changes
in the managerial structure of the company.
What Determines the Choice of a Tender Offer versus a Proxy
Fight?
A study by Sridharan and Reinganum attempted to determine why in some cases a
tender offer occurs and in other cases a proxy fight results.57 They analyzed a sample
of 79 tender offers and 38 proxy contests. They found that proxy contests tend to
occur more frequently in cases in which the company’s performance has been poor as
measured by its stock market performance and return on assets. Proxy fights, however,
tended to be associated with managerial inefficiency. The capital structure also seemed
to be a causal factor as less highly leveraged companies more often were tender offer
targets. They theorized that with more equity in the capital structure, there are more
shares that may be acquired. In general, they found that proxy fight targets are less
profitable than targets of tender offers. The poor performance of companies that are the
target of proxy fights gives the insurgents a more compelling argument for changing
management and enacting other changes.
The poor performance of proxy fight targets was also confirmed by Ikenberry and
Lakonishok, who found in a sample of 97 election contests “negative abnormal returns
and deteriorating operating performance prior to the announcement of the proxy
contest.”58
Combination of a Proxy Fight and a Tender Offer
A proxy fight may be an effective ancillary tool when coupled with a tender offer. The
hostile bidder may use the proxy fight to effect the approval of a shareholder proposal

that would dismantle the target’s antitakeover defenses. For example, a bidder could use
a proxy fight to have the target dismantle its poison pill or other antitakeover defenses.
This would then be followed by a more effective tender offer. Another option available
to the bidder and/or insurgent is to have the target agree to elect not to be bound by the
prevailing state antitakeover laws.
Still another benefit of combining a proxy contest with a tender offer could be for
the bidder to use the proxy process to try to replace target directors who oppose the bid.
A proxy contest can also be used to replace the target board and have the new direc-
tors redeem a poison pill that may be inhibiting a bidder’s tender offer. A new board
also could initiate the process to have the company exempted from a target’s state anti-
takeover laws.
Disciplinary Effects of Proxy Fights
We have already discussed research such as the work of John Pound, who showed
how proxy contests tend to bring about changes in target companies after the contest.
A study by Vyacheslav Fos of proxy contests over the period 1994–2008 showed
that when the likelihood of a proxy contest increases, companies implement various
changes such as increasing leverage, dividends, and CEO turnover and decreasing R&D
and capital expenditures.59 He showed that these changes can actually reduce the
likelihood of a proxy contest.

CHAPTER SEVEN
Hedge Funds as Activist
Investors
H
EDGE FUNDS WERE DEVELOPED as an alternative to open-end investment
funds or mutual funds. Managers of hedge funds do not make public solici-
tations for capital to investors in general, and as such do not face the public
reporting requirements that their mutual fund counterparts do. Since hedge funds
do not face as great reporting requirements, investors have more limited access to
return data.
Hedge funds grew dramatically during the strong economy that prevailed over the
period 2003–2007 (see Figures 7.1a and 7.1b). The number of hedge funds roughly
doubled over the period 2001–2007, where they peaked at 9,550 funds. Hedge fund
assets grew similarly and reached 1.87 trillion in 2007. The subprime crisis and the
Great Recession caused the industry to shrink and many of the “weaker players” left
the business. However, fueled by large amounts of institutional capital to invest, growth
resumed in 2009 and by 2011 both the number of funds and total assets under manage-
ment surpassed their 2007 levels. This growth accelerated over the years 2012–2014
only to decline in the years that followed.
Within the hedge fund category, however, we have two subgroups that are relevant
to M&A. One is the risk arbitrage hedge funds, which we have already discussed. The
other that we will now focus on is the activist hedge funds. These are funds that spe-
cialize in acquiring positions in targets that may be undervalued or that have other
characteristics that make them vulnerable to activists. Sometimes this vulnerability is
based on poor performance. Other times it could be that the company’s past perfor-
mance left it with high levels of liquid assets that the activists want the company to use to
return cash to shareholders in the form of a stock buyback. This was the case in 2014,
when Carl Icahn pressured Apple into using its cash to fund a more rapid stock buy-
back program than what it had planned. He got the company to buy back $14 billion
in stock within a two-week period. While this was not as much as he sought, he did not

totally succeed due to the fact that he took on a huge target that already was pursuing a
buyback program. In addition, Apple’s institutional shareholders failed to rally around
the activist, and ISS also failed to endorse Icahn’s initiative.
Activism hedge funds performed well in the postrecession period and showed better
performance than many other investments. As Figure 7.2 shows, this led to dramatic
growth in the number of activist fund assets under management (AUM) by these funds.
The assets under management by activist funds rose significantly over the period
from 2009 to 2015 when they reached $123 billion and were close to that level in 2016.
This is impressive in light of the fact that in 2005 it was $29 billion. The dramatic rise
in the value of activist assets is naturally related to a marked increase in the number
of activist campaigns (see Figure 7.3). There were 343 activist campaigns in 2014 and
319 in 2016. Some interesting changes occurred in activist campaigns in recent years.

First, we have seen more campaigns being conducted by new activists—as opposed to
just a limited group of large activists. The second new trend was that campaigns had an
expanded focus, including more smaller-cap companies—not just very large-cap firms.
MACROECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS OF THE GROWTH OF
ACTIVIST FUNDS
We have noted that the number of activist funds as well as total AUM of these funds has
grown dramatically. We have also pointed out this is partly due to the favorable returns

for such returns to be realized. We discuss these ahead.

282
◾
Hedge Funds as Activist Investors
The 18-month-long Great Recession between January 2008 and June 2009 was
one of the most severe downturns we have had since the Great Depression. It was totally
unlike the relatively mild eight-month U.S. recessions we had in 1990–1991 and 2001.
However, unlike other deep recessions we had in 1973–1974 and 1982–1983, the
recovery from the Great Recession was initially quite anemic, particularly with respect
to the labor market, which is inextricably linked to consumer spending. After 2009
that growth picked up and the U.S. economy gained momentum. The growth in the
U.S. economy helped stimulate a rebound in equity markets. During this recovery, the
stock market was quite strong and indices such as the S&P500 reached record levels.
While the strength in equity markets was good for most companies, some, the laggards,
could not keep up. Some of these laggards exhibited poor financial performance, and
their stock prices did not rise as much. Many of these companies became the focus of
opportunistic activist funds.
Another macroeconomic factor that helped activist funds was the low-interest-rate
environment that prevailed in the United States and Europe. This made the costs of debt
financing lower for potential acquirers. At the same time, many companies had rising
cash balances, which also could be used to finance acquisitions. These factors made it
easier for activists to claim that there were many potential bidders who could finance an
acquisition of the target company.
LEADING ACTIVIST HEDGE FUNDS AND INSTITUTIONAL
INVESTORS
Figure 7.4 lists some of the major activist hedge funds. The top part of the figure shows
some of the leading names that have been in the “activist business” for some time and
are often in the media. These include Carl Icahn, David Einhorn, and Bill Ackman, as
well as Nelson Peltz. The bottom part of the figure, however, shows some other entrants
into this business.
While we are well aware of the role of the aforementioned activist investors, who
have established funds just for this purpose, institutional investors are starting to engage
in more activism. Institutions such as CalPERS and CalSTRS have become more active
in this market. Funds have gone so far as to establish internal groups to address activism
issues, as they have recognized activist funds have at times generated good returns and
that it might pay for them to deviate from the traditional buy and hold investment strat-
egy. Sometimesthese institutional investorsmay interact withtheactivistsinsucha way
that they will mutually support and benefit from the activism.
The activists tend to vary in their approach to activism. Some are very aggressive
and public in their approach and may launch an attack at a company, following it up
with a media blitz to put maximum pressure on the target’s management and board.
Others may announce their ownership of shares and what they demand from the com-
pany but then may pursue a more toned-down, behind-the-scenes battle for the changes
they are looking for.

Leading Activist Hedge Funds and Institutional Investors
◾
283
FIGURE 7.4
Leading activists.
It is important to bear in mind that these activists are really short-term value
investors. In a sense, both they and the target’s management and board have common
interests in that both want the company’s stock price to go up. Where they differ is how
quickly they want to bring this about and by what means. For example, the activists
may want the company to be put up for sale immediately while management may even
agree that an eventual sale is a good idea but they may not think this is the right time.
Disclosure Requirements for Activists
Activists that accumulate 5% or more of a company’s shares would prefer to file a brief
13G filing but this is a difficult position for them to take with the SEC given the nature
of their business. They are in the business of influencing the control of companies and
they often take actions that result in the sale of a firm. Thus, they will likely fall under
the more detailed requirements of 13D, which requires significant disclosure and also
requires timely updating (see Chapter 3).
Changing Nature of the Targets of Activists
Traditionally, activists tended to target smaller companies. This is because a large,
well-financed activist fund can acquire a large percentage of a smaller target’s shares
and basically “bully” the target board and management to get it to do its bidding. How-
ever, powerful activists, such as Carl Icahn’s fund, had trouble with larger companies

284

where they could invest billions in the target’s stock yet still hold only less than 5% of
its shares. This was the case in his attack on AOL Time Warner. However, while he was
not successful in replacing the management, he was able to get a positive return on his
investment in the company.
The activist landscape changed in the years 2012–2014, and companies as large
and successful as Microsoft and Apple found themselves the target of activists. This is
quite significant as it shows that no company is invulnerable and all have to be on guard
for attacks by increasingly aggressive activists. This can be a good thing or a bad thing. It
can be good as it pressures managers to run the company for the benefit of shareholders
as measured by a good return on their equity. It pressures them not to amass assets such

better off staying in the hands of the company rather than being distributed to share-

pressures of activists.
Part of the reason for activists pursuing larger targets is that with larger funds and
much greater AUMs, larger targets are needed to produce more significant returns. Even
if larger targets are more challenging for the activists, the larger AUMs demand that
bigger prey be pursued. In 2016, activist funds expanded their horizons and pursued
smaller targets—not just the very large-cap companies that were more their focus on
recent years.
Activists and “Short-Termism”
Activists are short-term investors. They acquire a position in a company and usually
have a near-term exit strategy. They want to pressure the company to take actions that
will cause the stock price to rise and enable them to exit the investment at a profit. Crit-
ics have contended that this can pressure a public company to manage the company
to meet the near-term goals of the activist while sacrificing the long-term profitability
and growth of the company. Activists will say that it is current management that has
in the past sacrificed the true long-term growth and profitability of the company and
that this mismanagement has created an opportunity for the activist, who is seeking to
correct this problem. This continues to be a topic of debate, with both sides presenting
arguments that, depending on the particular circumstances, may have some merit.
Activist Campaigns for Board Seats
As we have discussed, activist hedge funds have grown significantly in recent years. Con-
comitant with that growth has been increasingly aggressive activist tactics—especially
as they relate to influence on the target’s board. Not that long ago an activist investor
would acquire shares in the target and then try to pressure the target to put one or two of
its representatives on the board. The thinking was that with a representative or two on
the board the activist would be able to directly monitor the board’s activities and delib-
erations but also have its voice and views heard at each board meeting.

An example of such an activist campaign occurred in 2016. William Ackman and
his activist firm Pershing Square Capital Management, which owned 10% of Chipotle
Mexican Grill, demanded and got two seats in the board of directors on Chipotle. As part
of its agreement with the company, Ackman and his firm agreed to not comment pub-
licly about the firm for a period of two years—a longer silent period than is typical of
such agreements. In addition, the agreement also restricted Pershing from raising its
stake above 12.9% over that same time period.
Over time, however, activists began to demand more. Some were not satisfied by
a voice on the board; they wanted multiple representatives on the board. Often there
were calls for three or four representatives to be placed on the board. This sometimes
grew even further to calls for control of the board. When an activist is so bold that it
wants to take control of the target’s board, that board knows it is in for a real fight. The
activist also knows that there is a good likelihood that its plans for the company will be
taken seriously. Oftentimes, this means that there will be a serious negotiation followed
by some agreement or settlement between the activist and the target.
The type of people nominated to boards by activists can vary. They often are peo-
ple on the payroll of the fund, including possibly the head of the fund. They also could be
industry experts or people who have been employed in the industry for some time. Some-
times, the activist has in mind having these specific people assume active management
positions at the company if their activism is successful.
There is often a give and take in the board placement process. For example, the
activist may propose three candidates that might include the portfolio manager of the
fund and two outside industry people. The company may come back and say it accepts
the two outside people but does not accept the internal fund representative. This, then,
can be the subject of a negotiation process and will be a function of the relative bargain-
ing positions of the two parties.
While activists make a variety of demands, battles over boards seats remain their
main focus. After seats on the board, their next most common demand is the return on
monies on the balance sheet to shareholders (including the activists).
AGGRESSIVE ACTIVIST HEDGE FUND: STARBOARD
VALUE VERSUS DARDEN RESTAURANTS
W
hen one thinks of aggressive activist hedge fund managers the names of Carl
Icahn and Bill Ackman come to mind. However, if we think about the most
aggressive activist contest, perhaps the leadership position goes to Jeff Smith and
his Starboard Value fund. In 2014, and with less than 10% of the stock in Darden,
Smith was able to take 100% control of Darden’s board. This is even more notable
when one considers that Darden actually had a competent and well-informed board.
(continued )

Hedge Funds as Activist Investors
(continued )
They were also advised by leading investment banks, such as Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs and the well-known law ﬁrm Wachtell Lipton.
Darden is a Fortune 500 company that owned well-known restaurant chains
such as Red Lobster, Olive Garden, and Longhorn Steakhouse, as well as Capital
Grill and Yardhouse. Darden was originally part of the food giant General Mills
but was spun off as part of General Mills’ increased focus strategy. In addition, the
company owned a signiﬁcant amount of real estate. In 2013, Darden was singled
out by another hedge fund, Barrington Capital, which came up with a restructuring
plan that called for the separation of slow-growing chains such as Olive Garden and
Red Lobster and focusing on faster growth and higher margin chains like Capital
Grille and Yardhouse. The plan also called for putting the real estate holdings into a
real estate investment trust (REIT), which could provide shareholders with cash ﬂow
and tax beneﬁts.
After it left General Mills, Darden was a real growth story but that growth slowed
in 2012 at a time the economy was actually picking up steam and competitors were
starting to register some good growth. The performance of some of the older chains
like Red Lobster and Olive Garden, which appealed to lower middle class and
middle class consumers, were hard hit by a U.S recovery that increased corporate
proﬁtability while real wages in the U.S. were ﬂat. As Barrington and Darden battled
for who had the best solution to the problem, Smith and Starboard pounced on the
vulnerable Darden. Some imply that Smith’s aggression was a “chance to burnish
his brand as an activist investor.”a
Darden’s board’s position was that they had studied these issues long before
Barrington or Starboard came on the scene and that their ideas were not novel. The
hedge funds, however, would say that if that was the case, the fact that the board
did not take more aggressive action earlier made it even worse.
Darden, which recognized that the poorly performing Red Lobster chain was
a glaring problem, retained Goldman Sachs to conduct an auction. This was made
more difﬁcult by the hedge funds opposing the sale and calling for shareholder
approval before it could be completed. This reduced the interest of some potential
buyers. Darden postponed the annual meeting and enacted bylaw changes to make
calling a sooner annual meeting more difﬁcult. Starboard used this action to enlist
the support of large institutional investors such as Starboard’s largest shareholder,
Capital Research and Management. In fact, this is one of the unique aspects of
this control contest. Normally, institutional investors are somewhat passive and
often side with management. Here Starboard was able to enlist the support of the
institutional investors.
Darden reached a deal to sell Red Lobster, and it felt it was getting a good
price in light of the chain’s poor ﬁnancial performance. Starboard opposed the sale,
claiming the price was too low. The board was hamstrung in its ability to publicly
argue for the sale, as to do so effectively would require them to discuss how badly
Red Lobster had been doing.
Smith and Starboard initiated a proxy ﬁght to remove Darden’s board. ISS
and Glass Lewis supported Starboard (see Figure A for a timeline). In retrospect,
Darden’s board, while quite qualiﬁed, probably did a poor job communicating with
its larger shareholders. Smith, on the other, did an excellent job.

Investor CEOs Fear the Most,” by William D. Cohan.
Smith won the battle of the directors and replaced the entire board with himself
and his handpicked representatives. This raises certain governance issues. Normally,
boards should include outsiders who are unafﬁliated with management along with
insiders. It does not always work out that way but that is the goal. What Starboard
and Smith did was ﬁll all the seats on the board with their own representatives.
While this gave rise to criticisms it is hard to argue with the success the turned
around company has had since the proxy battle.
The new board oversaw many improvements at Darden. For example, same
store sales at the Olive Garden unit rose signiﬁcantly. This improvement was the
product of many changes, such as changing the way the food was prepared and
reducing the number of ingredients used and improving the ﬂavor of the breadsticks
and many other improvements. This is an example of the micro-involvement of some
activists.

Staggered Boards and Activist Contests for Board Seats
In Chapter 5 we noted that when coupled with a poison pill, the combination can be a
powerful antitakeover defense. However, staggered boards, or even poison pills, are not
that relevant in activist battles where the activist is looking to accomplish its goals by
replacing just a few members of the board. If this can be done, then majority control of
the board, something that would normally be made difficult by the staggered board, may
not prevent the activist from accomplishing its goals. In addition, outside pressures have
forced many companies to abandon their staggered boards. Figure 7.5 shows that these
efforts to force companies to eliminate classified boards have been more fruitful at larger
companies. For example, in 2016, 258, or 43%, of the S&P600, a small-cap index, had
classified boards, whereas just 51, or 10%, of the large-cap S&P500 had such boards.
HEDGE FUNDS AS ACQUIRERS
As hedge funds began to feel the pressures from competitors to generate high returns,
they started to look to takeovers—previously the exclusive fund territory of private
equity funds. Investors took notice when Edward Lampert, through his hedge fund ESL
Investments, did a blockbuster takeover of Kmart in January 2000. Lampert took over
Kmart as it was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In 2004, he then
pursued an $11.5 billion merger between Kmart and Sears to form a retail giant that
could try to compete on a more even basis with market leader Wal-Mart; however, to
say this did not work that well would be a gross understatement.
Another example of an activist acquisition was Nelson Peltz and his Trian hedge
fund which were able to leverage his position as an activist shareholder to acquire
Wendy’s in 2008 and then merged Wendys with Arby to form Wendy’s Arby’s. In 2011
they sold off Arbys to a private equity firm—the Roark Capital Group.

Hedge Funds as Acquirers
◾
289
Hedge Funds Team Up with Hostile Bidders
The continually evolving takeover business moved dramatically in another direction in
2014 when hedge fund activist William Ackman, and his Pershing Square fund, teamed
up with Valeant Pharmaceuticals to make a $45.6 billion unsolicited bid for Allergan.
Ackman brought special capabilities to the deal, including not just financing but also
skills developed from being a highly successful activist over many years. They combined
to purchase 9.7% as a toehold in Allergan. As discussed in Chapter 6, the value of this
position could fall if the bid does not succeed and another bidder does not buy Allergan.
However, if the deal is not successful and another bidder acquires Allergan, the acquisi-
tion premium paid could provide handsome gains on the equity position in Allergan.
Over the period of February through April 2014, Ackman and Valeant acquired a
4.99% stake in Allergan, mainly through the purchase of Allergan call options. The bulk
of the capital was advanced by Pershing Square and not Valeant, which put up only less
than $100 million. Once they crossed the 5% threshold, they had to file a Schedule 13D
within 10 days. During that 10-day window, Ackman and Valeant acquired another
4.7% stake in Allergan.
Ackman’s innovative bid for Allergan was ultimately not successful. Actavis, for-
merlythegenericdrugmakerWatsonPharmaceuticals,outbidAlleganandValientwith
a $66 billion cash and stock offer. While Ackman did not win the bidding contest, he did
win financially as Allergan’s largest shareholder. The Activis bid was expensive, which
meant a good return on Ackman’s holding. For Activis, this deal was one of several it did
in recent years. It acquired Forest Laboratories in February 2014 for $28.4 billion. In
2013, it acquired Warner Chilcott for $5.9 billion, and in 2012 it acquired the Iceland
drug maker Actavis for $5.9 billion and assumed the more well-known name Actavis.
The Allergan deal moved Actavis into the ranks of the top-10 drug companies in the
world. While Valeant, a company built through M&A, lost out on this deal, in 2015 it
acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $10.4 billion.
Hedge Funds as Sources of M&A Debt Financing
Hedge funds have pursued many different investment areas as they seek to find attractive
returns for the capital they have been able to easily raise in recent years. One area they
have focused on has been the debt of distressed companies. However, in recent years
they have become involved in debt financing of M&As. Commercial banks often origi-
nate M&A debt financing that they syndicate to hedge funds that assume what usually
is second lien debt. The addition of this source of debt financing from hedge funds has
augmented the total capital that is available for M&A financing.
Impact of Activist Hedge Funds on M&A Activity
The influence of activist hedge funds on M&A activity is complex. As we have noted,
activist hedge funds usually have a short-term investment horizon and often seek to
realize relatively short gains from their share positions. A common scenario is that one
or more hedge funds acquire a share position in a company they may believe is under-
valued or that has assets that could be sold or otherwise restructured. They may seek

290
◾
Hedge Funds as Activist Investors
a short-term return through actions such as forcing the sale of the company. This then
may contribute to an increase in M&A volume. It would be a similar result if the activists
pressured the company to sell off certain assets to release unrealized values. Here, again,
the acquirer’s transaction helped increase overall M&A volume. However, if the target
of the activist’s interest wanted to pursue a strategic merger that would pay gains in the
long run, the hedge fund might oppose the deal as it is looking for a short-term payoff.
In this instance this opposition might lead to a lower overall level of M&A. Thus, we see
the impact of activists on overall M&A volume is complex and not obvious.
When the M&A market is weak, the activist funds may have to pursue a strategy
other than pushing the company to sell itself. This has led some of them to be more
like financial engineers or operational activists. The financial engineering activist is per-
haps too strong a term as many of these activists merely want the company to do basic
things, such as use cash on the balance sheet to buy back shares. This is hardly financial
engineering in the advanced MBA sense. The operational activist may get more deeply
involved in the company’s operational performance and may want to have the company
run differently. This requires more time and study of the business and the industry. Such
funds may employ industry consultants to help them with these tasks. They also may
focus on certain industries and have former workers in their industries working full-time
at the fund.
Very shortly in this chapter we will discuss the how research shows that activist
interventions with targets leads to higher returns and improved financial performance.
However,thesereturnsalsocancomefromthetargetbeingacquiredor,atleast,themar-
ket increasing its assessment of the probability of the target being acquired and share-
holders receiving an acquisition premium.
Boyson, Gantchev, and Shivdasani analyzed a large sample of over two thousand
activists campaigns and related it to a sample of three thousand merger transactions
over the period 2000–2014.1 They eliminated situations such as hedge funds engaging
in risk arbitrage around a takeover bid, as that is not the focus on the research on hedge
fund activism on M&A activity. They had a number of important findings. First, activist
hedge fund interventions significantly increased the probability that the target would be
taken over. When this takeover was implemented by a third party (not the activist), the
targetreceivedhigherbidsandpremiumsandalsotherewasahigherpercentageofcom-
pletion of deals that were initiated. Even when the bid failed, the operating and equity
market performance of the targets improved in the years that followed. However, these
positive patterns were not present when the activist was the actual bidder as opposed to
a third party.
Activist Hedge Funds and Shareholder Wealth Effects
It is not unusual that when activist hedge funds announce they have accumulated
an equity position in a company, it can have an uplifting effect on its stock price.
For example, when well-known activist Carl Icahn announces a stock position in a

company at which he intends to become an activist, the stock undergoes what some
have euphemistically referred to as the “Icahn lift.”
Researchers have quantified this general phenomenon. For example, in an analy-
sis of filings over the period 2001–2006, Brav, Jiang, Thomas, and Partnoy found that
the announcement of hedge fund activism was associated with 7% abnormal returns
over a short window around that announcement date.2 Other researchers have similar
findings.
In a study of 197 hedge funds over the period 1998–2005, Christopher Clifford
analyzed the shareholder wealth effects of their activist blockholdings.3 He was able to
discern which holdings were passivist or activist through a review of the fund’s Schedule
13D filings with the SEC. Clifford found that companies that were targeted by activists
realized higher excess stock returns. He found that firms targeted by activists experi-
enced a 3.39% cumulative excess return around the announcement date. The firms the
activists targeted also showed improved operating performance, as measured by their
return on assets. He traced many of these improvements to the divestiture of underper-
forming assets.
Klein and Zur confirmed the findings of other researchers who had found posi-
tive shareholder wealth effects of activist hedge funds accumulating stock positions
in companies.4 However, they expanded the scope of the research on this issue by
comparing the market effects of activist hedge fund share accumulations with those
of what they called entrepreneurial activists. This group consisted of individuals or
asset managers acting on their behalf, private equity firms, and venture capitalists.
They are considered activists if the purpose of their share accumulations was to bring
about change in the company that would raise the stock prices and provide them with
a profit from their investment as a result of their activism. Both samples were drawn
from the 2003–2005 time period and were of a similar size: 151 hedge funds and 154
entrepreneurial activists. They found similarities and disparities in the market reactions
to these two types of activists. While both were associated with positive abnormal
stock returns, hedge funds showed 10.2% returns while the entrepreneurial group was
associated with a 5.1% return. For both, the returns did not dissipate over time. In fact,
they found that hedge funds’ abnormal returns one year later were 11.4% and 17.8%
for the other group.
Klein and Zur found that both groups were often successful in getting the tar-
get companies to do their bidding. Hedge funds had a 60% success rate while the
entrepreneurial group was successful 65% of the time.
One other very interesting finding of Klein and Zur was that the two groups of
activists seemed to target different types of companies. Hedge funds tended to target
companies that were in better financial condition than did the entrepreneurial activists.

◾
Hedge Funds as Activist Investors
Hedge funds seemed to seek out companies that had higher cash resources, and then
they tried to pressure them into buying back shares and make other changes, like
lowering senior executive compensation and increasing dividends. The entrepreneurial
activists tended to focus more on the company’s strategy. Often this was associated with
changes in research and development and capital expenditures in the year after they
began their activism.
Klein and Zur found that the way each group achieved its goals was through the use
of the proxy process. However, they did not necessarily do so by actually having a proxy
fight. Rather, they tended to use the threat of a proxy fight as their main tool to achieve
their different goals.
Greenwood and Schor delved further into the source of these positive shareholder
wealth effects.5 They did this through the analysis of a large sample of companies that
filed Schedule 13Ds over the years 1993–2006. They then cross-referenced this sample
to the 13F filings, which are made by institutions (see Chapter 3). This led to a large
sample that included many passive investors, which had to be deleted. They examined
DFAN14A filings, which are filings made with the SEC by those non-management
investors considering pursuing a proxy fight. Specifically, this form must be filed with
the SEC by any registrant when there is an upcoming shareholder vote. It is designed to
provide shareholders with sufficient information for them to make an informed vote or
to allow another party to vote by proxy.
Greenwood and Schor analyzed the shareholder wealth effects of the whole sample
and subsamples that included those that were acquired and those that were not. They
found announcement period returns of greater than 5% for those companies that were
eventually acquired. This is roughly double what the returns were for those companies
that experienced other outcomes. Thus, their findings imply that the ability of activists
to generate above normal returns is due to the target being sold—usually at the behest
of the activists.
HEDGE FUND ACTIVISM AND FIRM PERFORMANCE
Hedge funds usually do not seek to take over a company in which they assume an
equity position. They seek to realize an attractive return through their agitation so as
to get the target company to make meaningful changes that will uplift the stock price.
Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas analyzed the market’s reactions to announcements of
activist hedge funds assuming positions in companies.6 As we have already noted, they
used filings over the period 2001–2006, and they found an average abnormal return
equal to 7%. They noticed that the performance of the companies improved after being
targeted by hedge funds. They also noticed greater CEO turnover and increased use of
pay for performance. Their research seems to imply that hedge funds can be a useful

a result that should be kept in mind when this topic is revisited in Chapter 13.
Bebchuk, Brav, and Jiang analyzed 2,040 activist interventions over the period
1994–2007.7 They found that operating performance tended to improve after the
activist interventions. They focused on performance measures, such as return on asset
and Tobin’s Qs.8 In addition, they found that these performance improvements were
not offset by falloffs somewhat later, which could have implied that they were just
temporary and perhaps a function of accounting manipulation (see Figure 7.6).
Still additional evidence of the performance improving effect of hedge funds can be
found in the work of Benjamin Solarz, who analyzed 718 hedge fund investments; he
discerned from reading the funds’ 13D filing that 393 were activist and 325 were passive
investments.9 As with other researchers, he concluded that the funds were activist if
they indicated in their filings that they sought specific action, such as board seats, or
wanted to pursue a proxy fight.

First, as shown in Figure 7.7, activist funds, especially those that sought board seats
(213 of the 393 activist investments) showed very clear short-term, excess returns that
were significantly greater than passive investments.
Solarz also measured the performance of the companies that had active and pas-
sive hedge fund investors. For example, he found that after a two-year period there were
improvements in the company’s return on assets for the active group and declines in
the passive group. He also found that shareholders gained through increases in lever-
age (although some might say this increases the company’s risk) and a greater dividend
payout ratio.
BUYOUT PREMIUMS: ACTIVIST HEDGE FUNDS VERSUS
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS
In Chapter 8 we cover leveraged buyouts, and in Chapter 9 we focus on private equity
firms, which are often buyout sponsors. However, since activist hedge funds have an
impact on these buyouts, we will discuss their role in this chapter.
There have been a number of cases where activist hedge funds have opposed
takeover bids by private equity firms on the grounds that the bids included an insuffi-
cient takeover premium. The goal of a private equity buyer is to acquire the target at as
low a cost as possible and to be able to sell it at a later date at a significantly higher price.
Normally, target shareholders are not in a position to bargain for a higher premium
and rely on boards to act in their best interests. However, when the ranks of the target’s
shareholders include an activist hedge fund that holds a significant block of stock, and

may even have one or more seats on the board, the game changes and usually not for
the better for the private equity buyer.
Huang analyzed a sample of 237 buyout proposals for U.S. public targets over the
period 1990–2007.10 He found that a one standard deviation increase in the fraction
of equity of the target that is held by hedge funds prior to a buyout announcement was
associated with a 3.6% increase in the buyout premium. He also found that the number
of shares held by other types of institutional investors, such as mutual funds or pen-
sion funds, did not have any impact on buyout premiums. Huang also found that this
premium uplifting effect was greater for management buyouts than outside initiated
buyouts. It also was stronger for club deals—deals where more than one buyout firm
combines to make a joint bid—than solo buyout offers.
Role of Institutional Investors
For many years, a growing percentage of equities have been owned by institutions as
opposed to retail investors. A high percentage of institutional investors vote their shares
while most retail investors do not bother to vote. The low voting rates of retail shares
became even more pronounced by various rules that have been adopted that limit a
broker’s ability to vote uninstructed retail shares held in street names. The result is a
concentration of voting power in the hands of institutions.
Unlike their counterparts of the 1980s, hostile raiders, activists hedge funds often
do not hold very large equity positions in the target. Still for large-cap companies, their
holdings, which can vary but could be 5% to 7%, for example, represent a large finan-
cial investment for them. However, they rely on the financial support of institutional
investors who traditionally have not been very activist in their investment approach.
Asagroup,institutionalinvestorsownthebulkofthesharesinatypicalpubliccom-
pany. Figure 7.8 shows the declining percentage of total shares outstanding owned by
retail investors. A few very large institutional investors have a disproportionate interest
in large-cap companies. Figure 7.9 shows how shareholdings, and with it voting power,
has become more concentrated in the hands of a few major financial institutions. The
figure shows the percentage of shares, a rising percentage, in the S&P 500 companies
held by just four firms: Blackrock, Fidelity, State Street, and Vanguard.
Thus, their support for activist initiatives is very important to the success of the
activist’s campaigns. When it became clear to institutional investors that when an
activist targets a company, share values can rise and performance often improves,
institutional investors gained a financial incentive to support their activist initiatives.
While institutions have often raised concerns about the short-term orientation of many
activists, these institutions themselves are under short-term performance pressures and
will tend to respond positively to proposals that will allow them to generate short-term
returns and bonuses for fund managers.

Institutional support of activists can be even greater for managers of index funds.
These investors are not discretionary investors. They cannot “vote with their feet” and
may be locked into an equity position in a company generating poor returns. Such man-
agers are more likely to support activists who put forward a plan to improve performance
and, thereby, generate higher returns. With the increased awareness that active fund
managers often fail to generate sufficient returns to justify their fees, many mutual fund
investors have shifted out of active funds and into lower cost index funds. This increased
the importance of index fund and their voting power.

Serial Activists
In Chapter 4, we discussed the characteristics of serial acquirers and how many are
very successful. Recent research shows that the same is largely true for serial activists.
Boyson, Ma, and Mooradian analyzed 2,540 hedge funds activist campaigns over the
period 2001–2013.11 They found that the targets of hedge funds activists that did
more campaigns, and, therefore, had significantly more experience, had both higher
short-term cumulative returns around the campaign time as well as better long-term
performance following the campaign. The latter is harder to measure with serial
acquirers, as when the bidder acquires the target, and actually a number of other
targets, it is hard to discern the long-term impact of a specific acquisition or to even
have enough relevant data to do an analysis of that. However, for serial activists, it was
possible for Boyson et al. research to show that the value that activists bring is greater
the more active the activist is.
“Wolf Pack” Activism
Initially, hedge funds operated like “lone wolves” where one specific hedge fund would
target a specific company. Then, like wolves, they learned that operating in a pack could
enhance their collective power.12 However, such cooperative activities could run afoul
of SEC disclosure rules if it was determined that they were really a “group” and did not
do the necessary disclosure filings.
While the wolves might, at times, operate as a group, they can independently take
advantage of each other. For example, if a lone wolf can acquire shares in advance of
a main lead wolf crossing the 5% threshold and filing a Schedule 13D, it could get an
immediate spike in the value of the shares it acquired and possibly sell them off for
significant gain.
Communications among Activist Shareholders
It is not unusual to see activists communicate their views and plans to other activist
funds. That is, they may “tip each other off” on their views, either bullish or bearish, on
particular companies. These communications may precede their share accumulations
or short sales. One concern is whether these are communications of legitimate invest-
ment research and strategies or efforts at stock manipulation. The magnitude of some
of the activist market moves can help make them self-fulfilling prophecies.
An analysis conducted by the Wall Street Journal looked at the market movements
of specific stocks 10 days prior to bullish and bearish announcements by activists. In
an analysis of 975 bullish announcements by lead activist investors in 2007, they
found that stocks rose an average of 3.2% over the 10-day period before the announce-
ments (see Figure 7.10). Similarly, in an analysis of 43 bearish announcements by

lead activists, they found the stocks declined 3.8% in the 10-day period after the
announcements (see Figure 7.11).
This is an issue being examined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
current laws on insider trading do not prohibit communications among investors of
their views on companies. It can get a little more complicated if the investors work

together in a manner that could be considered a “group,” which could trigger a
disclosure requirement at an earlier date than what would have been required without
such communications.
In light of the fact that activist investors can have such a significant influence in the
market, should regulators reexamine the sharing of information on companies among
activists? One activist simply telling another about his strong views on a company and
its market valuation can provide great insight into his investment plans, even if the
plans themselves are not disclosed in detail. Should this be treated as inside informa-
tion? Clearly, it is not inside information the way it is defined in the current law (even
though the law in this area actually does not clearly define inside information). How-
ever, does such sharing of insights give selected activists such an advantage over other
investors that it tilts the playing field too far in their favor? This issue will be examined
in more detail by regulators in the future.
Target Resistance to Activists
With the rise in hedge fund activism potential target companies started to develop
quicker and more sophisticated responses. Some interacted well with activists and
developed working relationships with them. Many others, however, became instant
opponents with each pursuing aggressive campaigns against the other.
Boyson and Bichler analyzed a sample of over a thousand activist events over the
period 2000–2012.13 In about one-quarter of the events, the target firms initiated dif-
ferent forms of resistance. Many of these forms of resistance involved adopting poison
pills, classifying the board, or changing voting requirements. When poison pills were
adopted, they often had trigger percentages that were just above the shareholdings of
the activist, thus limiting their ability to acquire more shares. They also limited the abil-
ity of other shareholders or activists to team up against the target lest they fall under the
Williams Act’s requirements governing the actions and filing requirements of groups.
In approximately two-thirds of these events the activists counter-resisted by either
pursuing a proxy fight or initiating a lawsuit.
Boyson and Pichler’s research confirmed what has been apparent from prior
research—that the stock market responds favorably to activist events. However, their
research showed that the market responds negatively to target resistance. Then, if the
activist counter-resists, the market response turns favorable again.
Timing of Implementation of Target Defenses in Response
to Activists
In response to overtures from activists, target boards often seek to enter into a settle-
ment agreement. These agreements usually include a standstill agreement that may
freeze the activists’ share accumulation for a period of time and also include further con-
cessions from the activists. After securing such agreements, some targets have sought
13 Nicole Boyson and Pegaret Pichler, “Hostile Resistance to Hedge Fund Activism,” paper presented at the
American Finance Annual Meetings, January 2016.

to install stronger defenses through different corporate bylaw amendments. However,
the Delaware Chancery Court has indicated that it would review such post-settlement
corporate defenses under the Unocal Standard, as opposed to applying the more lenient
business judgment rule.14
Hedge Fund Activism and Impact on Peer Companies
When an activist hedge fund targets a specific company, other similarly situated com-
panies may become concerned that they might also be a target of activists. Gantchev,
Gredil, and Jotikasthira analyzed a sample of 1,305 target years over the period
1994-2011.15 Their analysis revealed significant positive externalities or spillover
effects. They found that peer companies that were potential targets changed their
financial behavior. They increased their leverage and payouts and lowered their cash
holdings—actions that activists would normally push targets to take. Their return on
assets and asset turnover also improved along with their valuations. In effect, they
made changes that their shareholders favored that gave the activists little to complain
about.
ACKMAN & PERSHING SQUARE AND VALEANT
W
illiam Ackman is one of the more well-known activist investors, but the per-
formance of some of his investments in 2015 and 2016 left a great deal to be
desired. His ﬁrm lost its investors 20.5% in 2015 and 13.5% in 2016.a He ultimately
sold his entire stake in Valient for a $4 billion loss. This type of performance hardly
justiﬁes the fees hedge funds typically charge their investors—2% of assets under
management and 20% of any gains.
Valeant is a pharmaceutical company that was largely built on M&As. Its strategy
was to acquire smaller pharma companies and then seek to sell the drugs these
acquired ﬁrms sold at signiﬁcantly higher prices. Such practices drew the ire of
consumers who relied on such drugs for their health and wellbeing. U.S. politicians,
as is their nature, then saw this as an opportunity to extract short-term political
gains from the company’s pricing policies.
Valeant traces its roots to Biovail of Canada, which later merged with Valeant
in 2010 and assumed the Valeant name. The company became a serial acquirer, as
it acquired over 30 companies in the four years after its merger with Biovail.b The
more notable of these were its acquisitions of Medicis for $2.6 billion in 2012, Natur
Produkt for $180 million, and the Bausch and Lomb eye-care company in 2013 for
$8.7 billion—which was it biggest deal.c
Some serial acquirers are very successful. Sysco and GE are probably two of
the more notable examples. In fact, as we discussed in Chapter 4, research shows
that companies that are frequent acquirers are more likely to enjoy success with
their M&As, as they seem to perfect the art of M&A the more they engage in it.

Valeant is an exception, although for much of its life it did do successful M&A and
was able to garner the support of well-known hedge funds such as ValueAct.
As Valeant grew through its serial acquisitions it began to set its sights on
larger targets. In 2013, it tried to merge with drug maker Actavis but this deal,
which was valued at roughly $13 billion, fell through. Actavis then decided to merge
with Warner Chilcott in a $5 billion stock deal. It also failed in its hostile bid for
Cephalon, which ultimately sold itself to Teva Pharmaceuticals for almost $7 billion.
In 2014, Valeant teamed up with William Ackman and his Pershing Square
hedge fund to try to buy Allergan. Allergan successfully fought off Valeant. In its
defense, it challenged Valeant’s business model, which it termed a “house of cards.”
Other investment ﬁrms shorted Valeant’s stock.
After being spurned by Allergan, Valeant rebounded with a successful $11
billion acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015. However, also in that year regu-
lators targeted Valeant’s drug pricing and distribution policies, which raised a cloud
over the company.
In 2015, Ackman revealed that he had began selling its shares in Valeant. The
investment was a disaster for Pershing Square. Reports have indicated that Pershing
invested a total of between $4.6 billion and $5 billion in Valeant and only got back
$874 million.d Assuming the $5 billion amount, that would result in a loss of greater
than $4 billion!
The huge loss of Valeant was not his only failure. He previously had a ﬁrm
called Gotham Partners that had to be wound down due to illiquid investments
and redemptions demanded by clients.e He also lost money on the high-proﬁle
crusade he pursued against Herbalife, in which he was opposed by Carl Icahn.
The problems of Ackman and Pershing Square came at a time where the overall
performance of the hedge fund industry has been generally weak—especially in
light of the fees funds charge investors and the outsize compensation hedge fund
managers often take.

CHAPTER EIGHT
Leveraged Buyouts
L
EVERAGED BUYOUT (LBO) is a financing technique used by a variety of entities,
including the management of a corporation or outside groups, such as other
corporations, partnerships, individuals, or investment groups. Specifically, it
is the use of debt to purchase the stock of a corporation, and it frequently involves
taking a public company private. Its popularity is affected by factors such as the level of
interest rates and the availability of debt financing. The low interest rates that prevailed
during the years 2004–2007 helped explain why so many large LBOs occurred in that
period. The lack of debt financing in the years of 2008–2009, at a time when interest
rates were low, helps explain the big falloff in the number of deals in those years. In
the economic recovery that occurred during 2010–2017, debt financing became
increasingly available due to the large amounts of liquidity provided by expansionary
monetary policy, but lenders were cautious and would not fund all of the types of deals
that they did before the subprime crisis.
TERMINOLOGY
There is much overlap in LBOs and going-private transactions. A going-private
deal is where a public company is taken private. Sometimes this is referred to as a
public-to-private transaction (PTP). Such a transaction is financed with some debt and
some equity. It should also be kept in mind that a debt-financed buyout can be done of
a non-listed, that is, non-public, firm. When the bulk of the financing comes from debt,
this deal can also be referred to as an LBO. In the 1960s and 1970s these deals were
sometimes referred to as bootstrap transactions. When the owners of the formerly public

company is a private firm or other financial institution, the deal is sometimes referred
to as an institutional buyout.
When a company sells a business unit, or even the entire company, to a manage-
ment group, this type of deal is referred to as a management buyout (MBO). Many of
these transactions involve a public company divesting a division, and in doing so they
sell it to the unit’s management as opposed to an outside party. Sometimes they are also
referred to as unit management buyouts. When managers rely mainly on borrowed cap-

is significant overlap in the terms that may be used to describe these transactions.
HISTORICAL TRENDS IN LBOS
Early Origins of LBOs
While the actual term leveraged buyout came into popular use in the 1980s, the concept
of a debt-financed transaction in which a public company goes private has been around
for a much longer period. One notable example was the LBO of the Ford Motor Com-
pany. In 1919, Henry Ford and his son Edsel, being displeased with having to answer to
shareholders who differed with the founder of the auto company on issues such as divi-
dend policy, borrowed what was considered an astronomical sum at that time to take the
world’s largest automobile company private. The Fords purchased the company’s shares
that they did not own for $106 million (approximately $1.76 billion in 2014 dollars),
of which $75 million was borrowed from a collection of East Coast banks, such as Chase
Securities of New York, Old Colony Trust, and Bond & Goodwin.1 The Fords wanted to
be free to manufacture and sell their Model Ts at ever-decreasing prices, which would
come from reinvesting profits in the company as opposed to distributing them to share-
holders. Shareholders such as the Dodge brothers were happy to cash out their positions
in the auto giant as they were using their capital to expand their own auto company
to compete with Ford, making higher-priced cars. Investors wanted higher profits that
could be facilitated by higher prices, but Henry Ford was consumed by making the auto-
mobile affordable and attainable for the average American, and he needed continually
lower prices to bring this about.
It is interesting to note that some of the problems that befell the LBOs of the fourth
merger wave also affected Ford. When the U.S. economy turned down in the years
1920–1921, Ford incurred a cash crunch, and many worried it would not be able
to service the huge debt load it had taken on in the buyout. Ford responded with a
temporary halt in production, followed by layoffs and other cost-cutting measures.
However, Ford had alternatives at its disposal that most companies do not have. Rather
than have to head, hat in hand, to the East Coast bankers whom he despised, Henry Ford
exercised rights in his agreements with Ford dealers and shipped them the mounting

inventory of cars, even though they did not necessarily need them. This required the
dealers to pay for them, and the dealers all across the United States headed out for
financing, giving the Ford Motor Company the cash infusion it needed. Ironically, Ford
got access to the needed cash by its dealers taking out many loans, as opposed to Ford
seeking distressed financing.
Trends in LBOs: 1970s
The number of large LBOs increased dramatically in the 1980s, but they first began
to occur with some frequency in the 1970s as an outgrowth of the 1960s bull mar-
ket. Many private corporations took advantage of the high stock prices and chose this
time to go public, thereby allowing many entrepreneurs to enjoy windfall gains. Even
though some of these firms were not high-quality, their stock was quickly absorbed by
the growing bull market. When the stock market turned down in the 1970s, the prices of
some lower-quality companies fell dramatically. The bulk of this falloff in prices occurred
between 1972 and 1974, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from 1036 in
1972 to 578 in 1974. In 1974, the average price-earnings (P/E) ratio was six, which
is considered low.
When the opportunity presented itself, managers of some of the companies that
went public in the 1960s chose to take their companies private in the 1970s and
1980s. In addition, many conglomerates that had been built up in the 1960s through
large-scale acquisitions began to become partially disassembled through sell-offs, a
process that is called deconglomeration. Part of this process took place through the sale of
divisions of conglomerates through LBOs. This process was ongoing through the 1980s
and is partially responsible for the rising trend in divestitures that occurred during
that period.
Around this time newly formed LBO firms, such as Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts
(formed in 1976), Thomas Lee Partners (formed in 1974), and Forstmann Little
(formed in 1978), created investment pools to benefit from finding undervalued assets
and firms and using debt capital to finance their profitable acquisitions. These firms
then became known as LBO firms. As time passed, many other firms would join them in
this activity, although the firms would later be known as private equity firms as opposed
to LBO firms.
Trends in LBOs: 1980s–2000s
The value and number of worldwide LBOs increased dramatically starting in the early
1980s and peaked by the end of the decade (Figures 8.1a and 8.1b). By the mid-1980s,
larger companies were starting to become the target of LBOs; the average LBO transac-
tionincreasedfrom$39.42millionin1981to$137.45millionin1987.AlthoughLBOs
attracted much attention in the 1980s, they were still small in both number and dollar
value compared with mergers. For example, in 1987 there were 3,701 mergers but only
259 LBOs. Leveraged buyouts accounted for only 7% of the total number of transac-
tions. In terms of total value, LBOs accounted for a higher percentage of the total value

of transactions. In 1987, LBOs made up 21.3% of the total value of transactions, which
shows that the typical LBO tends to have a larger dollar value than the typical merger.
Some felt that the LBO structures were so efficient that they would start to replace the
typical public corporation.2 That prediction turned out to be very incorrect.
Figure 8.1 shows that the dollar value of LBOs fell dramatically in 1990 and 1991.
This decrease coincided with the decline in the junk bond market that started in late
1988 and the 1990–1991 recession that followed a few years later.
The LBO business of the 1980s was a very different business than the one that fol-
lowed over the period 1990–2017. In the fourth merger wave of the 1980s, a period that
has been associated with large LBOs and many colorful hostile takeovers, however, there
were a more limited number of sponsors or LBO dealmakers and also providers of debt
financing. The sponsors built their business on many personal contacts and were able
to aggressively pursue deals using very high leverage percentages—sometimes 85% or
90%. With such high leverage, even small increases in the value of the company could
result in high returns. These increases were brought about not by managerial acumen
of the LBO dealmakers but by the rising market combined with the high leverage.
Many things changed since the 1980s. Providers of debt financing began to
require much higher equity participations, in part due to many high-profile failures of
debt-laden LBOs. In addition, as basic microeconomics predicts, the high returns and
surprisingly minor barriers to entry attracted many competitors. The barriers to entry
were really the access to capital, which proved not that challenging given the very large
number of pension funds and endowments aggressively seeking diverse investments
in the hopes of achieving higher returns. They provided the equity capital, and then
access to bank financing and public debt markets provided the rest. Employees at some
of the original LBO firms went out to start their own firms, and the industry quickly
grew exponentially.
Once again, consistent with basic microeconomic theory, competition grew and
returns fell. Cao and Lerner have reported that while the average buyout firm formed
between 1980 and 1985 generated an impressive 47% internal rate of return, those
funds established between 1986 and 1999 earned less than 10%.3 Amazingly, the poor
returns did not stunt the fundraising activity of LBO dealmakers.
The value, and especially the number of worldwide LBOs, increased significantly as
we moved through the fifth merger wave. This effect was so pronounced that, by 1998,
the number of LBOs reached an all-time high. However, in 1999, the number of deals
increased approximately 50% over 1998, while in 2000 the number increased again.
Even though the number of deals in 2000 was approximately double the 1980 level, the
total value was only half. This is because the deals of the fifth merger wave were not the
mega-LBOs of the fourth wave but smaller and more numerous.

Leveraged Buyouts
The number and value of worldwide LBOs fell off dramatically in the 2001–2002
period. This is not surprising as these years coincided with a recession and an initially
weak recovery. By 2004, however, LBO volume (along with merger-and-acquisition vol-
ume) rose significantly. This dramatic growth continued through 2007. The four-year
period 2004–2007 proved to be the most robust LBO period in history. This growth was
partially fueled by readily available capital at somewhat modest rates through the col-
lateral debt obligations (CDOs) markets.
Not only were more LBOs being done, but also the average size of deals grew.
The magnitude of the LBO boom that took place between 2004 and 2007 can be
seen in Table 8.1, which shows that 7 of the 10 largest deals in history took place in
2006–2007.
The reason for this LBO boom can be found in the combination of a very robust
economy, with a rising stock market and a housing-market bubble, along with low
interest rates, which made the cost of debt financing for debt-laden LBOs unusually
inexpensive. Equity and debt capital was very readily available, and in many instances
there was more capital to do transactions than there were good deals to pursue. We will
discuss later in this chapter the key role that private equity firms played in LBO growth
during this period. This all came to a rapid halt when the subprime crisis took hold and
the global economy entered a recession in 2008. While interest rates stayed low due
to the stimulative monetary policy pursued by most central banks, credit availability
dramatically shrank.
LBO dealmaking fell to a near term low in 2009 and, while it rebounded in the years
that followed, it remained below the heady levels of 2004–2007.

RJR NABISCO: ONE OF THE LARGEST LBOS OF ALL
TIME
U
ntil 2006 the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout was the largest LBO of all time
and featured so many colorful characters that it was the subject of a feature
ﬁlm—Barbarians at the Gate—which, in turn, was based on a best-selling book
of the same name. The company was the product of a merger between the RJ
Reynolds tobacco company and the Nabisco food company.
There were several ﬁnancial characteristics that made RJR Nabisco an attractive
candidate for an LBO. Its cash ﬂows, especially those from its tobacco business,
were steady and predictable. The cash ﬂows from both businesses did not vary
appreciably with the ups and downs of the business cycles of the economy. In
addition, neither business required major capital expenditures, thus allowing room
for cash ﬂows to be absorbed with interest obligations. RJR also had another
characteristic that made it appealing to LBO dealmakers—it had a low debt level.
This meant it had unused debt capacity.
RJR Nabisco had not been performing well prior to the buyout. Its return
on assets had been falling while its ability to turn over its inventory had been
declining. However, its tobacco and food businesses featured many well-recognized
brands. The tobacco business product line included the Camel and Winston brands.
Its food business featured many products that are household staples and well
recognized across the world. The combination of many well-recognized products
gave the company a high breakup value that Smith Barney estimated to be in the
$85–$92-per-share range compared with the $56 stock price just prior to the initial
buyout offer.a
The initial offer for the company came from a management group led by CEO
Ross Johnson. It was a lowball $75-per-share offer that the board of directors,
which was very close and even beholden to Johnson, was embarrassed by. Johnson
faced the conﬂict of interest of being a ﬁduciary for shareholders, charged with the
responsibility of maximizing shareholder value, while also being in the position of a
bidder trying to acquire the company for the best price possible. The low offer by
Ross Johnson, who was backed by Shearson Lehman Hutton and Salomon Brothers,
attracted other bidders, who quickly saw an undervalued company and responded
with their own offers (see Figure A).
After a series of bidding rounds, the board of directors selected Kohlberg Kravis
& Roberts’ (KKR) offer. One unusual aspect of the board’s decision-making process
is that it took into account a variety of factors beyond just the absolute price. These
factors included a promise to keep the company intact and to still have some public
share ownership. The Johnson group’s offer included plans to sell off assets and use
the proceeds to pay down debt. The board also was concerned by the conﬂicts of
interest surrounding the Johnson initial low bid. KKR won the bidding contest, but
the acquisition did not prove to be a ﬁnancial success. In some ways the case is an
example of the winner’s curse, as KKR’s returns were not impressive.

Globalization of LBOs
Figure 8.2 shows that the value and number of LBOs in the United States peaked during
the years 2006–2007, fell off, and then rose significantly in the years that followed.
Figure 8.3 shows that while there were very few LBOs in Europe in the 1980s, the
volume of these deals increased dramatically in the late 1990s. In fact, in 2001–2005,
the value of European LBOs exceeded the value of U.S. LBOs. In addition, by 2005 the
number of LBOs in Europe was roughly double the number that occurred in the United
States. In addition, as Figure 8.4 shows, in many years the average value of European
LBOs was below that of the United States, indicating that more LBOs were completed
in Europe but, on average, they were somewhat smaller than the LBOs that took place

in the United States. However, in 2006–2007, while LBO deal value rose sharply in
Europe, the growth was even more dramatic in the United States. LBOs in both the
United States and Europe declined during the subprime crisis and rebounded afterwards
although the slower European economy dampened somewhat the rebound in Europe.
We have noted that 7 of the 10 largest LBOs of all time took place in 2006–2007
(see Table 8.1). These were all U.S. deals (see Table 8.2(a)). Table 8.2(b) shows that
there certainly were a number of mega-LBOs in Europe over the period of 2005–2007,
but some of the LBOs that took place in the United States were significantly larger.
MANAGEMENT BUYOUTS
As we have noted, an MBO is a type of LBO that occurs when the management of a com-
pany decides it wants to take its publicly held company, or a division of the company,
private. We have also noted that many MBOs are deals where a unit of a public company

The managers in an MBO may invest some of their own capital in the deal, but often
other equity capital is provided by investors while the bulk of the funds are borrowed.
The deal will often involve a sponsor working with the management group. The sponsor
typically provides capital and access to its relationship with investment banks, which
will work to raise the debt capital.

ers, board of directors, and management team. While the buying group is insiders in an

MBO, and outsiders in an LBO, the process is otherwise not that different. Presumably,
however, the buying group in an MBO has better access to information about the com-
pany’s potential profitability than an outside buying group has. This is one factor that
may give an MBO a greater likelihood of success than an LBO. Better information may
not be enough. If the parent company is seeking to sell the division because of poor per-
formance, it could be that this poor performance is attributable to management. An
MBO leaves the company still in the hands of the same managers, whereas in an LBO
the new owners may install their own managers. These new managers may be less tied
to prior employees and other assets and may be more willing to implement the changes
necessary to turn the company into a profitable entity.
When companies divest divisions, they normally sell them to outside parties. Only
a small percentage of the time do they sell them to managers. For example, between
2007–2016, only 2.3% of all divestitures were unit MBOs. Nonetheless, the numbers
are still significant. In 2016, the total dollar value of unit MBOs was $769 million, down
from $3 billion in 2015, with the average deal size in 2016 being $154 million. By M&A
standards, these are comparatively smaller transactions.
When managers decide to pursue an MBO they can work to secure the financing
themselves, usually with the help of their investment bank, or they can work with a
private equity firm which may provide a good percentage of the financing. In a study
of 129 PTP transactions in the United Kingdom over the period 1997–2003, Fidrmuc,
Palandri, Roosenboom, and Van Dijk were able to show that managers tended to go the
private equity route when they lacked the ability to secure the financing themselves.4
This is an intuitive result as managers may give up control in exchange for the assistance
of private equity partners.
KINDER MORGAN
I
n May 2006 the upper management of pipeline company Kinder Morgan, led
by Richard Kinder, announced a $13.5 billion buyout. At that time this deal was
the largest management buyout in history. Management proposed to contribute
just under $3 billion of the total acquisition price. This equity contribution was
augmented by a $4.5 billion investment by a group of private-equity investors led
by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and the Carlyle Group. The buyers planned to
assume over $14.5 billion in debt, giving the deal an enterprise value of over $22
billion. Kinder Morgan was formed in late 1996 by a collection of assets that were
disposed of by Enron for approximately $40 million. It is ironic that these assets
rose markedly in value while Enron collapsed. The increase in the company’s value
is principally due to its successful acquisition program, initiated in 1999.
The diverging fates of Kinder Morgan and Enron were partly attributable to
the strategies the two companies pursued. While Enron was a pipeline company,

it became a risky energy-trading enterprise. Kinder Morgan, a Houston-based
company founded in 1927 as K N Energy, conversely stayed in the pipeline business
and steadily grew within this industry. With its acquisitions, it became an increasingly
larger player in the less risky segment of the industry. Its steady performance
also lowered its risk proﬁle, which enabled management to attract private equity
investors.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN MANAGEMENT BUYOUTS
A clear conflict of interest may exist in an MBO. Managers are responsible for running
the corporation to maximize the value of stockholders’ investment and provide them
with the highest return possible. These same managers take on a very different role
when they are required to present an offer to stockholders to buy the company. We have
seen that this was the case when the management of RJR Nabisco presented an offer to
stockholders to take Nabisco private in an MBO. This offer was quickly superseded by
a competing offer from KKR as well as other responding offers from management.5 If
management truly was attempting to maximize the value of stockholders’ investments,
why did it choose to advocate an offer that it knew was clearly not in the stockholders’
best interests? Many researchers believe that managers cannot serve in this dual, and
sometimes conflicting, role as agent for both the buyer and the seller.
Another concern and potential conflict involves “earnings management” prior to
an MBO. Managers who are interested in buying the company from the shareholders
could have an incentive to take steps to lower reported profitability so as to pay less for
the acquisition. Indeed, in their analysis of 175 management buyouts over the period
1981–1988, Perry and Williams found evidence that discretionary accruals were
manipulated in the predicted direction in the year prior to the public announcement of
the MBO.6 Perry and Williams developed a control sample wherein matched firms for
each bought-out company were selected. Accruals such as increases in depreciation
expenses or decreases in noncash working capital were found to be associated with
reduction in income in the MBO group. These results give us cause for concern and
extra vigilance.
One proposed solution to these conflicts is neutralized voting, whereby the
proponents of a deal do not participate in the approval process. If the proponents are
stockholders, their votes would not be included in the approval process. They may
have to participate in the voting process because under some state laws a quorum may
not be possible without their participation if they hold a certain number of shares.7

U.S. Courts’ Position on Leveraged Buyout Conﬂicts
◾
319
The appointment of an independent financial advisor to render a fairness opinion is
a common second step in this process, which is meant to help reduce the conflicts of
interest. Even if these precautionary measures are adopted, certain practical consider-
ations may limit their effectiveness. Although those members of the board of directors
who may profit from the LBO may not vote for its approval, other members of the board
may have a close relationship to them and consider themselves obligated to support the
deal. Lawsuits by stockholders suing directors for breach of fiduciary duty have placed
limits on this tendency. Fairness opinions put forward by investment bankers who have
done much business with management or who may have a financial interest in the deal
may be of questionable value.
Although these steps are an important attempt to try to reduce some of the conflicts
inherent in the MBO process, they do not address the issue of the manager being both the
buyer’s and the seller’s agent. One solution that has been proposed is to have mandated
auctions of corporations presented with an MBO.8
U.S. COURTS’ POSITION ON LEVERAGED BUYOUT CONFLICTS
According to current case law, directors are not allowed to favor their own bid over
another bid once the bidding process has begun. The prohibition on an unfair bidding
process was set forth by a number of important court decisions. In Revlon, Inc. v. MacAn-
drews & Forbes Holdings, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that Revlon’s directors
breached their fiduciary duty in granting a lockup option to white knight Forstmann
Little & Co.9 The court ruled that this constituted an unfair bidding process that favored
Forstmann Little & Co. over hostile bidder Pantry Pride.
In Hanson Trust PLC v. SCM Corporation, the Second Circuit Court took a similar
position on the use of lockup options to favor an LBO by Merrill Lynch instead of a hostile
bid by Hanson Trust PLC.10 Hanson Trust had initially made a tender offer for SCM at
$60 per share. In response to Merrill Lynch’s LBO offer at $70 per share, Hanson Trust
upped its bid to $72. The court ruled that SCM gave preferential treatment to Merrill
Lynch by granting lockup options on two SCM divisions to Merrill Lynch.
In Edelman v. Fruehauf, the circuit court concluded that the board of directors had
decided to make a deal with management and did not properly consider other bids,
such as the all-cash tender offer by Asher Edelman.11 The court held that the Fruehauf
board of directors did not conduct a fair auction for the company.12 Although the

rule. The law is also unclear regarding when or even if an auction is required. The
formation of an independent directors’ committee may facilitate the auction process.13
This process is often used when management has proposed a buyout. When faced with
a management proposal to take the firm private, the board of directors will usually
respond by creating a special committee of independent, nonmanagement directors to
ensure that shareholders receive fair, if not maximal, value for their investment. The
committee may then decide to have its own valuation formulated, hire independent
counsel, and conduct an auction.
Postbuyout Managerial Ownership
Even when management, as opposed to an outside group, is the buyer of a business
unit, other equity is provided by outsiders, so management may not be in control of the
post-buyout business. It depends on how much equity capital is needed and how much
capital the managers have and are willing to invest in the deal. Using a sample of 76
management buyouts over the period of 1980–1986, Kaplan compared the median
prebuyout and postbuyout share ownership percentages of the CEOs and all manage-
ment.14 He found these percentages rose from 1.4% and 5.9% to 6.4% and 22.6%,
respectively. Management ownership more than tripled after the buyout. Theoretically,
given their much higher ownership interests, the managers should be better motivated
to ensure that the company moves closer to profit-maximizing efficiency levels.
Going-Private Premiums and P/Es Offered
The analysis of takeover premiums can be challenging in that it requires the researcher
to determine a consistent prebuyout price—one that takes into account any pre-deal
runup, and a final buyout price.
Table 8.3 and Figure 8.6 compare the median premiums for going-private deals
and M&As. A couple of trends are immediately apparent. We see that premiums for both
going-private deals and M&As vary over time. In general, they are somewhat compara-
ble. However, in certain periods, such as in the 1980s and 1990s, the average premium
for a going-private transaction was significantly lower than a merger or acquisition.
This changed when we got into the 2000s; during those years the premiums were
comparable.
When we compare premiums for the 2000s, it is useful to note that studies focus-
ing on earlier years found higher premiums. For example, an early study by DeAngelo,
DeAngelo, and Rice reviewed 72 MBOs during the period 1973–1980 and found rel-
atively average premiums equal to 56%.15 Another study done by Lowenstein, which
covered a similar time period, also found premiums equal to 56%.16 Still other research

Similar premiums were noticed in research on LBOs and MBOs in the United King-

Sources of LBO Gains
In Chapter 4, we reviewed some of the various reasons why companies pay premiums
and incur some of the expenses of mergers. They pursue these deals for reasons such as
enhancingtheirgrowthandrealizingsynergisticgains,aswellasotherreasons.Manyof
thesereasons,suchassynergies,maynotberelevantasforLBOsandMBOs.InMBOs,for
example, the company, at least initially, stays independent and does not have the oppor-
tunity to combine with another entity and realize synergistic gains. Then what is the
source of the gains that allows the acquirer to pay a premium and also incur the financ-
ing charges associated with the increased leverage? Research points to several potential
sources of these gains, which are discussed in the following sections.
Efﬁciency Gains
There are several areas in which efficiency gains can manifest themselves in an LBO. The
first has to do with agency problems.21 We discuss agency problems in several places
in this text. They arise when the true owners of the company, shareholders, have to
elect directors to oversee their interests.22 These directors select managers who have
a fiduciary responsibility to run the company in a manner that will maximize share-
holder wealth. However, managers are human and they may pursue their own agendas
and seek to further their own gains at shareholder expense. In doing so, they may not
manage the company in a manner that will maximize profits. Managers may know that
if they generate an acceptable return, such as πmin in Figure 8.7, it would be difficult
for shareholders to mount a successful proxy fight and demand their ouster. πmin could
be the average rate of return in the industry. Given that information on potential prof-
itability is asymmetric and management is in a much better position to assess this than
shareholders or even the board of directors, managers may know that πmax is possible.
This gap between potential profitability, πmax and πmin, is depicted in Figure 8.7. This
is the theoretical gain from eliminating unnecessary costs and selling the output level
where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Managers may be following a different
agenda, such as seeking to make the company larger than it optimally should be, so as
to maximize their compensation, because it is well known that larger companies pay
higher compensation to management.23

Boards try to install performance-based compensation systems to better align
management and shareholder goals.24 These are far from perfect. In the 1990s, more
option- and stock-based incentives were touted as a partial solution to the managerial
compensation problem. However, as a result of the various accounting scandals that
occurred over the period 1998–2002, such as WorldCom, Enron, and Adelphia, critics
cited such compensation schemes as one of the main problems. Managers pursued
illegal means to try to raise stock prices, which, in turn, would provide them more
stock-based compensation. In the wake of the subprime crisis, it was clear that much
of the oversized compensation of executives at large financial institutions that turned
in abysmal performance included large equity grants. Clearly, installing stock-based
incentives in the compensation package is not the total solution to eliminating the
agency problem at public companies.
Managers who have a good sense of the difference between πmax and πmin may
believe that this difference is sufficiently large to more than offset the costs of doing the
deal and paying the service on the debt. This was certainly the case when Ross Johnson
pursued his MBO proposal for RJR Nabisco. Unfortunately, his lowball offer so shocked
his very friendly board that they looked to other offers, an auction ensued, and the
company ended up being sold to KKR for a much higher price that eliminated many of
the gains Johnson foresaw.

Leveraged Buyouts
There is some evidence that efficiency gains really do occur in buyouts. For
example, Harris, Siegel, and Wright examined productivity of 36,000 UK manufactur-
ing plants.25 They compared those that underwent an MBO with those that did not.
They found clear increases in efficiency as reflected in output/labor ratios as well as
other measures of factor productivity. They also noted that the MBO companies were
less efficient than the non-MBO group prior to the buyouts. So these were companies
where the potential for gain in the form of increased efficiencies was greater than for
those that did not undergo a buyout.
Undervaluation as a Motive for LBOs
One motive which may explain why some MBOs occur, and which is related to efficiency
gains, is undervaluation of the target company. Managers may be very aware that the
companyisgeneratingareturnthatiswellbelowwhatitiscapableof.Thismaymotivate
them to pursue an MBO. It may also motivate them to buy the company’s undervalued
shares. Harlow and Howe, as well as Kaestner and Liu, found that MBOs were preceded
by an abnormal amount of share purchases by managers, which was not the case in
non-management buyouts.26 This would seem to be a concern as managers, as fiducia-
ries for shareholders, should be managing the company to increase its value and remove
the undervaluation as opposed to taking advantage of it. Research by Kieschnick found
support for the undervaluation hypothesis as an explanation of buyouts.27
TXU: HUGE BUYOUT BUST
T
he 2007 buyout of TXU Corporation was one of the largest of all time, and it
would become the biggest LBO bust of all time. The resulting bankruptcy case
became the eighth largest in U.S. history. The buyout was a club deal involving
such major private equity ﬁrms as KKR, TPG, and the buyout unit of Goldman
Sachs. Other major private equity ﬁrms, such as the Apollo Group and Blackstone,
purchased large amounts of Energy Future Holdings debt, which was the name that
the company assumed after the buyout.
There are several lessons in the TXU LBO failure. First, it underscores how
heady market conditions can blur the vision of seasoned dealmakers. Many deals
looked good in 2006 and 2007, especially to those who can’t see that what goes
up too high often comes down. When the market is at a peak, many businesses
look great. What these major ﬁrms should be “bringing to the table” is the ability

to be able to predict how conditions would differ if there was a major change in
the market. This was especially needed in this case when the LBO candidate is in a
commodity business.
This leads us to the second major ﬂaw. Companies in volatile businesses, such
as commodity oriented ﬁrms, tend not to make good LBO candidates. An LBO
leaves the company with relatively high amounts of debt which require steady debt
service. For TXU, the company had almost $40 billion in debt. However, when natural
gas prices fell in 2011, it lost almost $2 billion. The deal may have looked good
when the economy was strong in 2007. However, debt-laden companies, which are
susceptible to commodity prices swings, are not likely to survive a major downturn
such as what we had in the Great Recession and the weak recovery that followed. It
is amazing that such major private ﬁrms, which make a living doing buyouts, could
not anticipate this. This was a criticism leveled at the industry in the late 1980s and
early 1990s when it went by the name LBO ﬁrms. Many of these debt-laden LBOs of
that era went bust, and the industry switched names to the more appealing private
equity moniker. While name switching may have worked for marketing the industry,
it did little for TXU and its investors.
Tax Beneﬁts
When a company increases its degree of financial leverage—that is, increases the
amount of debt relative to equity in its capital structure—it substitutes lower-cost debt
capital for equity capital and its weighted average cost of capital usually declines. In
general, even on a pretax basis, debt has lower costs than equity. That is, normally,
equity requires the investors to bear greater risk, and investors require a higher rate of
return before they assume this higher risk. In addition, interest payments on debt are
tax-deductible, thereby lowering the after-tax cost of debt capital.

Where

d = before-tax cost of debt
It is important to remember that when a company undergoes an LBO, the costs
of both debt and equity capital generally increase. This is due to the fact that it takes
on much more debt, which increases the risk profile of the company. It has more fixed
obligations, which increases the probability that it may not be able to service such obli-
gations as they come due. The market responds to this higher risk by requiring a greater
risk premium for both debt and equity. Nonetheless, its overall costs of capital, especially
after taking into account the tax deductibility of the interest payments, may be lower.
This, then, is a benefit of doing the deal and provides some basis for paying a premium
to the equity holders. The question is, how significant are these tax benefits?

326
◾
Leveraged Buyouts
The tax benefits from doing deals, and LBOs in particular, have changed over time
as a function of new tax laws. Tax benefits put into law in 1981 allowed for aggressive
accelerated depreciation. When this is combined with asset step-ups that are also
allowed, they provide significant incentives to do leveraged deals. This helps explain
some of the LBOs that took place in the fourth merger wave. However, the Tax Reform
Act of 1986 eliminated many of these benefits.
A study by Kaplan attempted to quantify the tax benefits that post-buyout firms
enjoy.28 He found that the tax benefitsfromLBOtransactionswerehighly variable, rang-
ing from 21% to 143% of the premium paid to the selling shareholders in management
buyouts. The gains, however, mainly went to selling shareholders and not to the owners
of the post-buyout company. “A comparison of the excess returns earned by pre-buyout
and post-buyout investors to several measures of tax benefits is consistent with
pre-buyout shareholders receiving most of the potential tax benefits. The returns to post
buyout investors are not related to the tax benefits created by the buyout. This is consis-
tent with a market for corporate control that forces the buyout companies to pay public
stockholderstax benefitsthat are ex-post predictableand obtainableby otherbidders.”29
Kaplan showed that the tax benefits of LBOs, while variable within a large range,
are largely predictable on a deal-by-deal basis, and are incorporated in the premium that
pre-LBO stockholders receive. This implies that the post-LBO investors need to find other
sources of value such as efficiency gains.
Cash Flow versus Asset-Based LBOs
As stated previously, LBOs are acquisitions that are financed primarily with debt. They
are usually cash transactions in which the cash is borrowed by the acquiring firm. Much
of the debt may be secured by the assets of the corporation being taken private. This
section provides an overview of the LBO process. The financing of these deals is discussed
in greater detail later in this chapter.
The target company’s assets are often used to provide collateral for the debt that is
going to be incurred to finance the acquisition. Thus, the collateral value of these assets
needs to be assessed. This type of lending is often called asset-based lending. Firms with
assets that have a high collateral value can more easily obtain such loans; thus, LBOs
are often easier to conduct in capital-intensive industries—firms that usually have more
assets that may be used as collateral than noncapital-intensive firms. It is not surpris-
ing, therefore, that Waite and Fridson found that LBO activity during the period they
studied was more predominant in manufacturing than in nonmanufacturing indus-
tries.30 Still, LBOs can also be done for firms that do not have an abundance of assets
that may be used as collateral. Service industries are one example. They tend not to
have as many physical assets with high-asset values that can be used as collateral for
loans, but they may still be good LBO candidates if their cash flows are high enough.

The high cash flows, as opposed to physical assets, provide the protection for lenders.
If the borrower defaults, however, the lenders may not have as many physical assets
that can be sold in liquidation. Debt capital providers hope that the cash flows will be so
reliable that they will never face a liquidation situation. They also are aware that even
physical assets can be adversely affected by downturns of a company if they are industry-
or even economy-wide downturns.
Cash-flow or unsecured LBOs, as they are sometimes called, tend to have a more
long-term focus, with a maturity of 10 to 15 years. In contrast, secured or asset-based
LBOs might have a financing maturity of only up to 5 years. Cash-flow LBOs allow firms
that are not in capital-intensive industries to be LBO candidates. This is most impor-
tant in the U.S. economy because the United States has become a more service-oriented
economy. Many service industries, such as advertising, lack significant physical assets
relative to their total revenue but have large cash flows.
Since cash-flow LBOs are generally considered riskier for lenders, they expect to
receive a higher return for assuming the additional risk. This higher return may come
from a higher interest rate as well as an equity kicker. This equity interest often comes
in the form of warrants or direct shares in the target. The percentage of ownership may
be as little as 10% or as high as 80% of the companies’ shares. The percentage is higher
when the lender perceives greater risk.
The fact that the loan is not collateralized does not mean that the lenders are not
protected by the firm’s assets. Unsecured lenders are entitled to receive the proceeds of
the sale of the secured assets after full payment has been made to the secured lenders.
Cash Flow Hypothesis of LBOs
It has been argued, with good cause, that, left to their own objectives, CEOs may engage
in empire building—if they can get away with it. Jensen has argued that the more a firm
has excess cash flow, cash flow beyond what is needed to fund all of its capital budget a
positive net present value projects, the more it may engage in such empire building.31
His curious “solution” is for the firm to take on more debt so that the extra interest would
soak up the extra cash flow and thereby would take care of them problem. He ignored
the more fundamental solution—better corporate governance. In fact, Holmstrom and
Kaplan make the argument that once there was a noticeable improvement in corporate
governance the need to have LBOs eliminate the “excess” cash flow declined.32
To the extent that the cash flow hypothesis may explain earlier LBOs, Mehran and
Peristiani showed that while excess cash flows may have motivated many of the deals
during the LBO boom of the 1980s, many of the companies that went private between
1990 and 2007 were smaller companies which lacked a strong market following.33

They often had low and declining institutional ownership and reduced analyst coverage.
This situation makes it difficult for these companies to do follow-on financing and also
reduces the incentive to deal with the burdensome public filing requirements and the
pressures of short-term investors. For such companies, there were limited benefits from
being public and the costs outweighed the benefits.
FINANCING FOR LEVERAGED BUYOUTS
Two general categories of debt are used in LBOs—secured and unsecured debt—and
they are often used together. Secured debt, which is sometimes called asset-based lending,
may contain two subcategories of debt: senior debt and intermediate-term debt. In some
smaller buyouts these two categories are considered one. In larger deals there may be
several layers of secured debt, which vary according to the term of the debt and the types
of assets used as security. Unsecured debt, which is sometimes known as subordinated
debt and junior subordinated debt, lacks the protection of secured debt, but generally
carries a higher return to offset this additional risk. To the debt financing is added an
equity investment. The percentage of the total financing that the equity component
constitutes varies, depending on market conditions, but it tends to be in the 20% to
40% range.
In an LBO the dealmaker, often called a sponsor, will work with providers of
financing—investment banks. Investment banks will conduct due diligence on the
proposed deal, and if confident it meets the criteria of the banks they work with, they
will present the deal to them. The lead investment bank may conduct a presentation
for the various prospective lenders wherein it shows its analysis and the reasons why
lenders should feel secure providing capital to finance the deal. A similar roadshow-type
process may be conducted to develop interest in an offering of high-yield bonds that
may be part of the overall deal financing structure. Such roadshows are often preceded
by the distribution of a preliminary offering memorandum related to the bond offering.
Before this memorandum can become final, it will usually need SEC approval; otherwise,
the bonds cannot be publicly offered.
If the banks agree to provide debt capital to the deal, they will often first provide
a commitment letter, which sets forth the terms of the loans. Sometimes banks will hold
some of the debt in their own portfolio while seeking commitments from other financing
sources as they syndicate the rest of the debt.
Debt capital comes from two main sources. Banker lenders may provide revolving
loans or amortizing term loans. These banks will include commercial banks, savings
and loan associations, and finance companies. Longer-term debt commitments typi-
cally come from institutional investors, such as insurance companies, pension funds,
and hedge funds. These dividing lines are not strictly defined, so we can see one group
providing different types of capital in different deals (or even the same one).
Part of the debt capital may come from a bond issuance. This may require the invest-
ment bank to provide a bridge loan to close the time gap between when all the funds are
needed to close a deal and when the bonds can be sold in the market.

LBO Debt Financing
There are two broad categories of LBO debt financing—senior debt and intermediate-
term debt. The exact mix of the various sources of debt varies across deals but Table 8.4
shows a typical LBO structure,
Senior Debt
Senior debt consists of loans secured by liens on particular assets of the company. The
collateral, which provides the downside risk protection required by lenders, includes
physical assets, such as land, plants, and equipment. The term of this debt can be five
years or more. Senior debt comes in various forms, which vary according to the nature
of the target’s business and the type of collateral it can provide.
Senior debt may constitute between 25% and 50% of the total financing of an LBO.
The interest rate tends to be in the range of prime plus 2% to 3%. Typical sources of this
secured financing are commercial and investment banks as well as other institutional
investors,suchasinsurancecompanies,mutualfunds,andfinancecompanies.Atypical
term is between 5 and 10 years. While bank debt tends to be the least costly form of
debt, it often comes with maintenance covenants, which impose financial restrictions on
the target over the life of the loan.
Bank debt is usually priced above some variable base market rate, such as LIBOR or
the prime rate. How much higher depends on the creditworthiness of the borrower.
Other Senior Debt Revolving Credit
In an LBO, the company will typically have access to revolving credit, which may be
secured by short-term assets, such as inventory and accounts receivable. The company
may pay a variable rate that is pegged to some base rate, such as the prime rate in the
prime plus a certain percentage. Revolving credit can be repaid but also “reborrowed”
as agreed upon with the lender. This form of credit is often used to deal with seasonal
credit needs, and how relevant it is depends on the nature of the business.
The sponsor may arrange a revolving credit line with a bank, which, in turn, may
syndicate it with other banks. Such credit lines usually require the borrower to pay a
commitment fee for access to the credit even if it is unused. If it is used, then the borrower

pays the interest rate as well. The revolving credit line is usually secured by some specific
assets and often has a term such as five years.
Asset-Based Lending (ABL)
If the business being acquired in the LBO has a high volume of current assets, such as
inventories or receivables, the sponsor may be able to secure an ABL debt facility, which
is secured by the relevant current assets. Usually this security provides a first lien on
the current assets, and maybe if other noncurrent assets are used, the lien may be a
second one. Lending with such facilities is a function of the allowable “borrowing base,”
which may define which assets are eligible. For example, older receivables or out-of-date
inventories might not be eligible. In addition, the lending percentage will usually be less
than the borrowing base to allow some protection cushion for the lender. ABL lending
facilities are usually five years in length.
Term Loans
Term loans are another form of secured credit. They can be investment grade or non-
investment grade. The latter group is referred to as leveraged loans. Unlike a revolving
loan facility, which can be paid down but also reborrowed, term loans usually have a
fixed amortization schedule and are to be paid over a set loan period. Once payments are
made, they cannot be reborrowed.
An LBO may feature different forms of term loans with some having more rapid
repayment of the principal than others. Those that have more rapid repayment,
sometimes called Term A loans, will tend to have lower interest rates (all other things
constant) than those that have more minimal principal repayment obligations—
sometimes called Term B loans. Term B loans are often marketed to institutional
investors and tend to be larger than Term A debt.
Subordinated Debt
The extent to which a debt is subordinated is set forth in subordination provisions of the
credit agreement or bond indenture contract. Subordination refers to the fact that more
senior creditors need to have their obligations satisfied before payment can be made to
the subordinated creditors.
Subordinated debt, sometimes also referred to as intermediate-term debt, is usually
subordinate to senior debt. The term is usually longer than the senior debt and may
range between 6 and 10 years. Given that it is subordinate to the senior debt, it is riskier
for the lenders so they charge a higher rate, which may be in the prime plus 4% to 7%
range.Avarietyofinvestorsmayprovidesuchfinancing,includingpensionfunds,insur-
ance companies, and finance companies, as well as mutual funds and hedge funds. The
terms tend to vary and may include some equity-linked features, such as warrants.
High-Yield Bonds
A major source of subordinated debt is high-yield or junk bonds. These are bonds that
have a rating of BB or worse from Standard & Poors (Ba from Moodys). We discuss junk
bonds in Chapter 10.

Financing for Leveraged Buyouts
◾
331
High-yield bonds used in LBOs tend to have maturities of between 7 and 10 years.
The coupon rate of high-yield bonds is usually pegged to Treasuries and includes an
additional risk premium that is a function of the creditworthiness of the issuer.
High-yield bonds may include call protections, which may limit the ability of the
issuer to prepay the debt. If the issuer does so, it may have to pay a call premium, which
usually declines over the life of the bond. The specific amount of the premium is usually
set forth in call schedules, included in the indenture contract.
These bonds may feature protective covenants; however, they tend to be less restric-
tive than the covenants included in bank debt agreements. These covenants usually
require that the borrowers maintain a certain financial condition over the life of the
loan. While bank debt protective covenants tend to be more restrictive than high-yield
bond covenants, an exception iscovenant-lite bank debt in the leveraged loan market. These
covenants are more like high-yield bond covenants than typical bank debt.
Bridge Loans
In order for an LBO to close, the sponsor needs to have all of the necessary funds avail-
able at the time of the closing. Sometimes the debt financing process can be a little fluid
and uncertain, but the sponsor and the seller both need to know the funds will be there
at closing. To alleviate this uncertainty, the sponsor’s investment bank might agree to
provide a bridge loan if necessary to eliminate this uncertainty. The investment bank
receives a commitment for making this capital available if needed. Usually, both parties,
the sponsor and the investment bank, hope that it will never be needed.
Vertical Strips
It is not unusual for investors to provide financing through more than one of the fore-
going categories. Although some institutional investors, such as insurance companies,
have tended to be unsecured investors, they often participate in more than one type of
LBO financing. This type of financing is sometimes referred to as vertical strips. In a ver-
tical strip, investors may participate in several layers of financing within the same deal.
For example, they may hold some secured debt and more than one form of unsecured
debt as well as some equity.
Standard Debt Paydown Strategy
As heralded by its proponents, an LBO involves a company taking on a substantial
amount of debt, but that debt should get paid down over a period such as five years,
using cash flows from operations and possibly asset sales (see Figure 8.8). For example,
Kaplan found that companies taken private in management buyouts paid down roughly
25% of their debt in the first two years after the deal.34
Standard Debt Paydown with Increased Enterprise Value
In Chapter 15, we discuss the computation of enterprise value. For now, we will simply
say it is the value of the debt and the equity of the target. Figure 8.8 basically assumed

that there was no increase in enterprise value over the 5-year period prior to exit from
the investment. However, deal sponsors seek to also gain from increasing the value of
the target and perhaps receiving a higher multiple as of the exit. Such a situation is
depicted in Figure 8.9. For simplicity’s sake, we assume that the increase in equity is
realized only in year five, although the increase in value would reasonably be expected
to have risen over the prior years, even though it is only in the year of the exit that it is
specifically known.
Leveraged Buyout Financial Analysis
The various participants in a leveraged buyout have to conduct their own financial anal-
ysis. This includes providers of debt financing as well as the sponsor. Fortunately, various

Rosenbaum and Pearl’s second edition of Investment Banking features very detailed M&A
spreadsheet models, including ones for an LBO.35 Thus, we will discuss only some basic
concepts here.
Internal Rate of Return on LBOs
LBO dealmakers look to a commonly cited measure of financial performance that
is a mainstay in the capital budgeting section of most financial analysis books and
courses—internal rate of return. A version of the relevant relationship is shown in
equation 8.2. The left side of the equation features the equity investment, and the
right side features various numerators that reflect the net cash flows generated by the
target companies. These cash flows may reflect additional equity investments (negative
amounts) and/or dividends received (positive amounts). In the example, we assume
that the sponsor will be able to exit the investment and hopefully sell the target at a
higher equity value that what it paid for it.
Given that the left-hand side outlay is known (and negative) and the cash flows set
forth in the numerators are projected, we have one unknown, r, the internal rate of
return. It is the rate that when solved for will bring about the equality shown in the
equation. Fortunately, we can use the built-in IRR function in Excel to solve for this rate.
CF0 =
CF1
(1 + r) +
CF2
(1 + r)2 + … +
CF5
(1 + r)5
(8.2)
CF0 = equity investment
CF1 … CF4 = annual cash flows that reflect any additional equity investments but
also any dividends paid out
CF5 = a combination of any additional equity, dividends, but mainly the exit
proceeds
r = internal rate of return
An example showing these calculations is depicted next. Notice the relatively large
value of $1.4 billion in year 5, which reflects the exit proceeds, which are well in excess
of the equity investment in year 0 of $600 million. When we calculate IRR, we get 23%.
As a rule of thumb LBO sponsors seek to get an IRR that is greater than 20%.

Leveraged Buyouts
Desirable Characteristics of Secured Leveraged Buyout Candidates
There are certain characteristics that lenders look for in a prospective LBO candidate.
Some of the more commonly cited features are discussed here:
◾
Stable cash flows. One of the most important characteristics of LBO candidates is the
existence of regular cash flows as determined by examining the pattern of historical
cash flows for the company. The more erratic the historical cash flows, the greater
the perceived risk in the deal. Even in cases in which the average cash flows exceed
the loan payments by a comfortable margin, the existence of high variability may
worry a lender. Dependable cash flows alone are not sufficient to guarantee the suc-
cess of an LBO.
Example: Southland Corp. The financial difficulties of the Southland Corpora-
tion after its $4.9 billion buyout in 1987 provide a classic example. The founders of
the company, the Thompson family, took the company private out of concerns about
a hostile takeover. The company’s main business was the cash cow 7–Eleven conve-
nience chain. Southland’s problems emerged when some of the 7–Eleven cash flows
were directed to noncore real estate ventures instead of paying off the buyout debt.
Even with its sizable cash flows, the company could not service its high debt load
and fell into bankruptcy where it was “rescued” by its Japanese franchisee Seven
and I Holdings Corp.
◾
Analyzing historical cash flows. Although historical cash flows are used to project
future cash flows, the past may be an imperfect guide to the future. Market con-
ditions change, and the future business environment may be less favorable than
what the company’s historical data reflect. The lenders must make a judgment as
to whether the past will be a reliable indicator of what the future will hold. Lenders
and borrowers usually construct cash flow projections based on restrictive budgets
and new cost structures. Such budget planning takes place for both secured and
unsecured LBOs, but it is even more critical for cash flow LBOs. These budgets may
include lower research and development expenditures and labor costs. The target
attempts to find areas where costs may be cut—at least temporarily. These cost sav-
ings may be used to meet the loan payments on the LBO debt. The importance of
cash flows to LBOs was underscored by a study by Lehn and Poulsen.36 They showed
that buyout premiums were positively related to the firm’s free cash flow. That is, the
market is willing to pay higher premiums for greater cash flow protection.
◾
Stable and experienced management. Stability is often judged by the length of time
management is in place. Lenders feel more secure when management is experi-
enced; that is, if management has been with the firm for a reasonable period of time,
it may imply that there is a greater likelihood that management will stay on after
the deal is completed. Creditors often judge the ability of management to handle an
LBO by the cash flows that were generated by the firms they managed in the past.

tions,” Journal of Finance 44, no. 3 (July 1989): 771–778.

Financing for Leveraged Buyouts

If their prior management experience was with firms that had significant liquidity
problems, lenders will be much more cautious about participating in the buyout.
◾
Room for significant cost reductions. Assuming additional debt to finance an LBO usu-
ally imposes additional financial pressures on the target, these pressures may be
alleviated somewhat if the target can significantly cut costs in some areas, such as
fewer employees, reduced capital expenditures, elimination of redundant facilities,
and tighter controls on operating expenses. Lichtenberg and Siegel showed that LBO
employee cutbacks were concentrated at the administrative levels of employment,
with an average administrative workforce reduction of 16%, while there tended to
be minimal cutbacks at the manufacturing level.37
◾
Equity interest of owners. The collateral value of assets provides downside risk protec-
tion to lenders. The equity investment of the managers or buyers and outside parties
also acts as a cushion to protect lenders. The greater the equity cushion, the more
likelysecuredlenderswillnothavetoliquidatetheassets.Thegreaterthemanagers’
equity investment, the more likely they will stay with the firm if the going gets tough.
Leveraged buyout lenders in the 1990s demanded a much greater equity cushion
than they did for the heavy debt deals they financed in the mid-1980s. As conditions
improved in the 2000s, however, lending terms became more liberal.
◾
Separable, noncore businesses. If the LBO candidate owns noncore businesses that can
be sold off to quickly pay down a significant part of the firm’s post-LBO debt, the deal
may be easier to finance. This may be important for both secured and unsecured
LBOs. Problems may occur when debt is incurred based on an unrealistic sales price
fornoncoredivisions.Theinabilitytosellcomponentsofthefirmonatimelybasis,at
prices similar to those expected by investment bankers, was one of the main factors
that caused the bankruptcy of the Campeau Corporation in 1989. Deals that are
dependent on the large-scale sell-off of most of the firm’s businesses are referred to
as breakup LBOs.
Types of LBO Risk
LBOs present a variety of risk. The risk of an LBO may be broken down into two main
categories: business risk and interest rate risk.
Business risk refers to the risk that the firm going private will not generate sufficient
earnings to meet the interest payments and other current obligations of the firm. This
risk category takes into account factors such as cyclical downturns in the economy and
competitive factors within the industry, such as greater price and nonprice competition.
Firms that have very cyclical sales or companies that are in very competitive industries
tend not to be good LBO candidates.
Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates will rise, thus increasing the firm’s cur-
rent obligations. This is important to firms that have more variable rate debt. Interest
rate increases could force a firm into bankruptcy even when it experienced greater than

and Other Personnel,” Journal of Law and Economics 33, no. 2 (October 1990): 383–408.

anticipated demand and held nonfinancial costs within reasonable bounds. The level of
interest rates at the time of the LBO may be a guide to the probability that rates will rise
in the future. For example, if interest rates are low at the time of the buyout, interest rate
increases may be more likely than if interest rates are at peak levels.
RETURNS TO STOCKHOLDERS FROM LBOS
The research in this area tends to focus on abnormal returns to pre-buyout shareholders
as well as premiums as measured by the difference between firm values derived from the
final takeover stock price as compared to the preannouncement stock price. The pre-
mium analysis can be complicated by how the preannouncement price is determined
and the extent to which the research allows for the preannouncement price runup. The way
researcherstendtohandlethisistouseapreannouncementpricethatincludesanantic-
ipation window such as two months prior to the actual announcement. Interestingly,
the results from the abnormal returns and the premiums studies can be quite different.
However, there is a reasonable explanation for this difference. Research using cumula-
tive abnormal returns already incorporates an expectation of a firm’s return which, in
turn, reflects how the market values post-buyout profitability.
One well-known early study was conducted by DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Rice, who
analyzed the gains to both stockholders and management from MBOs of 72 companies
that proposed to go private between 1973 and 1980.38 We have already noted that the
premium paid for their sample was 56%, which was higher than the premium data we
have shown for more recent years. They concluded that managers are willing to offer
a premium. In the 2000s, however, private equity firms came to dominate the buyout
market, and they are known to be more careful buyers.
Their research found that an average change in shareholder wealth around the
announcement of the deal was 22%. Over a longer time period around the announce-
ment, the total shareholder wealth change was approximately 30%. Consistent with the
results of the research for M&As generally, the announcement of the bid being with-
drawn caused shareholder wealth to decline by 9%.
A study by Travlos and Cornett shows a statistically significant negative correlation
between abnormal returns to shareholders and the P/E ratio of the firm relative to the
industry.39 This implies that the lower the P/E ratio, compared with similar firms, the
greater probability that the firm is poorly managed. Travlos and Cornett interpret the
low P/E ratios as reflecting greater room for improvement through changes such as the
reduction of agency costs. Some of these efficiency gains may then be realized by going
private. These gains become the source of the buyout premium.

Returns to Stockholders from Divisional Buyouts
◾
337
Modern LBOs Compared to Early LBOs
The collapse of many of the LBOs of the fourth merger wave led dealmakers to be more
conservative in creating the financial structures of their deals. This was confirmed by the
aforementioned study of 192 buyouts over the years 1990–2006 by Guo, Hotchkiss,
and Song. They found that, consistent with some of the findings we have already dis-
cussed, modern deals were more conservatively priced and less levered than the deals of
the fourth merger wave. They also found median and risk-adjusted returns to pre(post-)
buyout capital are 72.5% (40.9%).40 They defined the returns to capital as follows:
Nominal Return to Capital =
∑
Interim Payments to Capital + Terminal Value
Capital
−1
(8.3)
where the interim payments are the post-buyout payments made to the debt and equity
capital providers. The terminal value is the amount received at the outcome date. Cap-
ital refers to the value of the equity and debt either prior to the buyout, which is used
to compute returns to pre-buyout capital, as well as the buyout price, which is used to
compute returns to post-buyout capital.
Guo et al. also found that the LBOs in their sample showed operating performance
at least equal to, and sometime higher than, a benchmark group of firms they selected.
RETURNS TO STOCKHOLDERS FROM DIVISIONAL BUYOUTS
As we have already noted, MBOs are deals where a management group buys a division
from the parent company. Many of these transactions have been criticized for not being
“arm’s-length” deals. Managers of the parent company are often accused of giving pref-
erential treatment to a management bid. The parent company may forsake the auction
process and accept management’s offer without soliciting other higher offers. One way
to see if these transactions are truly in shareholders’ interests would be to look at their
shareholder wealth effects.
In 1989, Hite and Vetsuypens conducted a study designed to show whether
divisional buyouts had adverse effects on the wealth of parent stockholders.41 Many
researchers believe that divisional buyouts may present opportunities for efficiency-
related gains as the division becomes removed from the parent company’s layers of
bureaucracy. This may be a source of value to the managers of the buying group but
does not negate the often-cited possibility that a fair price, such as that which might be
derived from an auction, was not paid for the division.
Hite and Vetsuypens failed to find any evidence of a reduction in shareholder wealth
following divisional buyouts by management. Their results show small, but statistically

Leveraged Buyouts
significant, wealth gains for a two-day period surrounding the buyout announcement.
They interpret these results as indicating that division buyouts result in a more efficient
allocation of assets. The existence of small wealth gains indicates that shareholders in
the parent company shared in some of these gains.
The positive view of management buyouts from the perspective of parent company
shareholders was not supported by some later research by Briston, Saadouni, Mallin,
and Coutts.42 They analyzed a sample of 65 MBOs in Great Britain over the period
1984–1989. They found that parent company shareholders experienced negative
returns following MBO announcements. This finding is in sharp contrast to other types
of selloff announcements. This research implies that maybe parent company managers
give their former colleagues a better deal than they offer non-affiliated buyers.
Post-LBO Firm Performance
A number of studies showed substantial operating performance improvements after
management buyouts that occurred in the 1980s. Some of the early research on this
issue included Kaplan as well as Lichtenberg and Siegel studies, which both found
improvements in financial performance following the management buyouts.43 Later
research also presented similar findings. For example, Guo, Hotchkiss, and Song
analyzed a sample of 192 leveraged buyouts that were completed during the period
1990–2006.44 Not only did they find that the deals were less levered than their
1980s predecessors, but they also found that operating performance of the firms
that were taken private was at least as good as, and sometimes better than, matched
industry companies. They attribute the performance gains to the large positive returns
these deals yielded their investors. For example, Gao et al. found an 11% increase in
EBITDA/sales relative to comparable firms.
The positive results on LBO performance were not just restricted to U.S. LBOs. Var-
ious research studies have arrived at similar findings for LBOs in different European
countries such as Great Britain, France, and Sweden.
The impressive improvements in returns found by researchers such as Gao et al.
raised questions in the minds of some researchers, who wondered whether the fact that
the companies that were studied were the only ones that had publicly available finan-
cial statements made them a biased sample. The companies that have publicly available
financial statements could have sold public debt or undergone a subsequent transaction,
such as an IPO, which required disclosure of such data.
Cohn, Mills, and Towery analyzed a subsample of 71 companies that underwent an
LBO that had both tax returns and financial statements available to be studied. Consis-
tent with the prior research, they found that these firms did indeed show substantial

improvements in financial performance. For example, they found a 9% improvement in
mean return on sales over a two-year period after the buyouts.
Cohn et al. then focused on a broader sample of 317 companies taken private in
an LBO, including the 71 that had both tax return and financial statements available,
and others that had only tax return data available.45 They found little evidence that
thereareanymeaningfulperformanceimprovementsforthislargersample.Thisimplies
that those companies that had publicly available financial statements may have been the
ones that performed the best, which allowed them to issue public debt or even go public
again. Others may not have performed as well and may not have been able to pursue
such transactions.
The conclusion of the Cohn et al. research is that the positive view of LBOs that has
prevailed in the world of M&A research for many years may have been overly sanguine.
LBOs may enrich dealmakers and private equity investors and managers of these private
equity firms, but they may not have any positive effect on the companies themselves.
Employment Effects
One of the goals of LBO dealmakers, such as private equity buyers, is to lower the costs
of the acquired entity, which usually has to incur significantly higher debt service costs
after the deal. Such cost reduction strategies could include reductions in employment
levels. Various early studies have examined this issue and found that while employment
levels do not necessarily decline after an LBO, they do not rise as much as other compa-
nies in the same industry.46 A recent large sample study conducted by Davis et al. has
shed considerable light on this issue. They analyzed 3,200 target companies over the
period 1980–2005.47 They found a somewhat small 1% decline in employment levels
over a two-year period following the buyout. However, their analysis delved deeper into
the natural process of job creation and destruction at bought-out companies. The firms
could reduce employment levels at some establishments they own that they decide are
not operating efficiently. They also may open new establishments, and with these open-
ings new workers are hired by the bought-out companies. Thus, the net employment
effects they found naturally include layoffs but also new hiring. Together, this process
resulted in only a 1% overall decline in employment levels. However, they did find that
the average earnings per workers at continuing establishments declined 2.4% over the
two-year postbuyout period. Buyouts may bring about some declines in worker earnings
as the dealmakers seek to lower costs, but the net effect on the total number of workers
may feature a somewhat modest decline.

Leveraged Buyouts
Efﬁciency Gains and Unsuccessful Buyouts
We have discussed how certain researchers have documented various efficiency gains
associated with buyouts. They point to the buyout process and the changes in the com-
panies that are normally associated with the buyouts as being the source of the gains.
Another way to look at this issue would be to compare companies that successfully
completed their buyouts with those that did not. Do the ones that did not get to com-
plete their buyouts experience similar efficiency gains? Ofek analyzed a sample of 120
unsuccessful management buyouts over the period 1983–1988.48 Consistent with the
efficiency-enhancing theory of buyouts, he found that the unsuccessful group did not
experience efficiency gains. He also found higher management turnover, underscoring
the board’s displeasure with their lack of success.
Reverse LBOs
A reverse LBO occurs when a company goes private in an LBO, only to be taken public
againatalaterdate.Thismaybedoneifthebuyerswhotakethecompanyprivatebelieve
that it is undervalued, perhaps because of poor management. They may buy the firm
and institute various changes, such as replacing senior management and other forms
of restructuring. If the new management converts the company into a more profitable
private enterprise, it may be able to go through the initial public-offer process again.
The opportunity to conduct a successful reverse LBO is greater when the
going-private transaction takes place when the stock market is down and the public
offering occurs in a bull market.49 This may make the assets of the LBO candidate
undervalued in a poor market and possibly overvalued in the bull market. This reason-
ing, however, implies that the seller is somewhat naive and does not realize the impact
of the short-term market fluctuation.
Reverse LBO Research
Muscarella and Vetsuypens reviewed 72 reverse LBOs that went public since 1983
and underwent a buyout.50 Their study presents a favorable picture of the postbuyout
performance of these firms. They found that the ownership structure tended to be
concentrated, with management retaining a substantial fraction of the equity. Using
traditional accounting measures of performance and financial condition, they found
improvements in profitability that were the result of cost reductions as opposed to
increased revenues. These results were more dramatic for divisional LBOs than for
full firm buyouts. Reductions in capital expenditures were one of the more significant
sources of efficiency gains, but reduction in staffing was not. Even though the firms

increased their leverage to finance the buyout, management took steps to reduce debt
after the buyout. These results imply that the postbuyout firms are in better condition
than their prebuyout predecessors. It is not surprising, therefore, that shareholders
pay more when the firms go public for the second time compared with the price the
company sold for in the LBO. One question arises, however: If the management group is
essentially the same before and after the buyout, why did management not enact these
increased efficiencies as part of the fiduciary responsibilities for shareholders when
they were running the prebuyout company? This criticism may be less relevant for
divisional buyouts, in which management may be able to take broader actions because
they are not part of a larger bureaucratic structure of a parent company. It is also less
relevant for many of the private equity–conducted buyouts as the new private equity
owners seek to make whatever changes are necessary, including managerial changes,
to increase the value of their investment and resell the acquisition.
Holthausen and Larcker analyzed the postbuyout accounting and stock-price per-
formance of 90 companies that engaged in reverse LBOs from 1983 to 1988.51 They
found that these companies outperformed their industries over the four years following
the initial public offering. In addition, they noted that reverse LBOs also increased capi-
tal expenditures and working capital levels following the offering. They also noted that
when the ownership structure became less concentrated in the hand of managers, firm
performance declined.
Cao and Lerner analyzed a much larger sample of 526 reverse LBOs over the period
1981–2003.52 They compared the performance of reverse LBOs over three to five years
with that of initial public offerings (IPOs). They found that reverse LBOs performed as
well as the market overall and comparable to other IPOs. However, “quick flips,” where
a private equity firm sells the investment after holding it for a short period such as one
year, tended to underperform.
LBO Regulation and Disclosure: SEC Rule 13e-3
SEC Rule 13e-3, which attempts to regulate some of the problems of management
self-dealing associated with going private, is an amendment to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The rule governs repurchases in going-private transactions, and it applies
to share repurchases that result in fewer than 300 shareholders or when the previously
public company would no longer be listed on public stock exchanges or would no longer
be quoted in an interdealer quotation system. The rule requires that the firm going
private file a Schedule TO. In Chapter 3, we have already discussed the items that are
required to be revealed in this filing. With respect to MBOs, however, the filing must
contain information about the alternatives to MBOs that were considered as well as the
position of the outside directors.

Leveraged Buyouts
Leveraged Buyouts, the Position of Other Debt Holders,
and Wealth Transfers
One area of interest for many critics in recent years has been the potential impact of the
assumption of high amounts of LBO debt, and the associated issuance of junk bonds,
on the value of the investment of current bondholders. The fact that bondholders are
not part of the approval process has attracted much attention. The additional debt
increases the fixed payments that the firm has to make after the buyout. In doing so,
it increases the likelihood that the firm will be unable to meet these payments and be
forced into receivership.
This problem came to the fore in the RJR Nabisco buyout of November 1988. The
value of current bonds dropped sharply after the announcement of the LBO. Some
bonds fell as much as 15 points, or $150 for each $1,000 face-value amount, in the
week the buyout was announced. Although the losses incurred by bondholders drew
widespread attention in the RJR Nabisco buyout, bondholders have recognized it as
a problem for some time. When the R. H. Macy and Company $3.6-billion buyout
proposal was announced in 1985, the stock price rose $16 per share, whereas the price
of Macy notes fell more than three points.
Investors who are holding bonds in a corporation that is involved in an LBO see
the value and rating of their bonds deteriorate rapidly following the LBO announce-
ment. This has alienated bondholders, particularly institutional investors. For example,
Metropolitan Life saw its $340 million worth of A-rated RJR bonds downgraded to a
junk bond rating for a $40 million loss. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company sued
Nabisco in a New York State court. Metropolitan’s suit alleged that a small group of
Nabisco’s management sought to enrich themselves at the expense of bondholders who
had invested capital in Nabisco in good faith. Opponents of the bondholders contended
that the bondholders were seeking to control the operations and decisions of the corpo-
ration in a manner that should be reserved only for stockholders. They thought that if
bondholders wanted such control, they should have taken the risk of buying stock, not
the relatively lower-risk bonds.
On May 31, 1989, a federal judge ruled that an “implied covenant” did not exist
between the corporation and the RJR Nabisco bondholders, which would prevent the
corporation from engaging in actions, such as an LBO, that would dramatically lower
the value of the bonds. The court ruled that, to be binding, such agreements had to be
in writing.
EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON WEALTH TRANSFER EFFECTS
There has been much public outcry in the media regarding the losses that bondholders
have incurred after going-private transactions. Such media coverage implies that
there is a general wealth transfer effect from bondholders to equity holders in these
transactions. A study by Lehn and Poulsen failed to confirm the existence of such

an effect.53 They found no decrease in value of preferred stock and bonds associated
with LBOs. This result, however, was to some extent contradicted by Travlos and
Cornett.54 Although their analysis did reveal a decline in the value of bonds and
preferred stock following the announcement of going-private proposals, the decline
they reported was relatively small.
The limited research in this area fails to provide support for a large wealth trans-
fer effect. The empirical research indicates that if such an effect exists, it is not very
significant.
PROTECTION FOR CREDITORS
After the unfavorable federal court decision in the Metropolitan Life Insurance case,
bond purchasers began to demand greater protection against the financial losses
resulting from event risk. In response, they received from bond issuers agreements
that would allow them to get back their full principal in the event of a buyout that
would lower the value of their debt holdings. The covenants are usually triggered by
actions such as the purchase of a block of stock by a hostile bidder or other actions such
as a management-led buyout. In return for the added protection, bond buyers pay a
somewhat higher interest rate, which is dependent on the issuer’s financial condition.
The rate may be structured to the magnitude of the rating change.
Much of the protection provided by the covenant agreements is in the form of
a poison put, allowing the bondholders to sell the bonds back to the issuer at an
agreed-upon price. Poison puts had also been used as a form of shark repellent—that is,
companies would issue poison puts as a means of creating a financial obstacle to hostile
bidders. However, as we moved into the late 1990s and early 2000s, these protections
became less in demand. The fact that the mega-LBO has been around for some time,
along with the high volume of LBOs we have seen worldwide, means that these events
are already internalized in risk premiums that are built into corporate bonds.
Research by Billet, Jiang, and Lie showed that protective covenant agreements
provide value to bondholders.55 In a sample of 407 LBOs over the period of 1980–2006,
they found that bondholders who lacked covenant protection experienced significantly
negative −6.76% shareholder wealth effects around the announcement of LBOs,
compared to a positive 2.3% for bonds that have protection.

INTRA-INDUSTRY EFFECTS OF BUYOUTS
In Chapter 4, we discuss the effects on the stock prices of competitors from horizon-
tal mergers. Slovin, Sushka, and Bendeck analyzed 128 buyout bids over the period
1980–1988.56 Of these, 78 were from managers and 50 were from outsiders. They
noted that while target returns were significantly higher when the bids came from buy-
out firms, this had no impact on rivals. Slovin et al. found that bids resulted in positive
valuation effects for rivals and that these effects were not that different in outsiders or
management bids. They concluded that these positive valuation effects were due to new
information about the industry and firms in it were being created by the buyout, and the
price paid to target shareholders.
Harford, Stanfield, and Zhang analyzed a large sample of 586 LBOs over the period
1991–2006. The concluded that LBOs provide a signal to other firms about M&A as well
as LBO opportunities in the industry.57 They found that LBOs are likely to lead other
M&As. One interpretation of this result is that potential bidders may believe that if the
firm that underwent the LBO had so much “slack” that it could afford to take on signifi-
cant debt service obligations, then other companies in the industry might present good
profit opportunities.
Brown, Fee, and Thomas analyzed a sample of 355 LBOs and 43 leveraged recap-
italizations over the years 1980–2001. They found significantly negative returns for
suppliers of the LBO firms.58 Those suppliers which had a significant supply relationship
with the LBO firms were more negatively affected. They interpret their results as imply-
ing that maybe, post-deal, the companies that underwent a buyout would have more
bargaining power. Another interpretation, though, would be that the post-LBO compa-
nies would be forced to put more pressure on suppliers so as to be able to handle the
higher debt service. Another interesting finding of this study was that the firms which
were suppliers to companies that underwent a leveraged recapitalizations showed no
significant response to the deal. On average, the recapitalization firms were much larger
than the LBO companies. These recapitalized companies might have already enjoyed
buying power over the suppliers.

CHAPTER NINE
The Private Equity Market
T
HIS CHAPTER CONTINUES THE discussion of going-private transactions by first
focusing on the role of private equity firms. Private equity firms have played a
major role in the takeover market during the past quarter of a century. These
firms have been able to attract large amounts of capital and very aggressively pursued
takeovers.
HISTORY OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY AND LBO BUSINESS
The modern private equity business is not that old. We have had highly leveraged trans-
actions for some time, so using large amounts of debt to buy businesses is not a novel
concept. As we discussed in Chapter 8, Henry Ford did a highly leveraged transaction to
regain control of his company in 1919. This was long before the words leveraged buyout
and private equity even came into the vernacular of finance.
The first leveraged buyout took place in 1955, when McLean Industries, run by
Malcolm McLean, acquired the Pan-American Steamship Company and the Waterman
Steamship Company. He financed these acquisitions with the proceeds of the sale of
his trucking company, McLean Trucking (regulations at the time prohibited a trucking
company from owning a steamship company), and through bank debt and the issuance
of preferred stock. However, he was able to use the cash and assets of the target compa-
nies to help pay down the buyout debt.
In the 1960s and 1970s, other dealmakers learned from McLean and formed their
own investment firms to do similar types of buyouts. In the 1960s and 1970s, some
high-profile dealmakers, such as Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway) and Victor
Posner (DWG Corporation), used similar leveraged financing structures. They were

followed some years later by Boone Pickens (Mesa Petroleum) and Saul Steinberg
(Reliance Insurance).
In the 1970s, a few bankers at Bear Stearns also did leveraged deals. Two of them,
Henry Kravis and Jerome Kohlberg, left Bear Stearns to form their own firm—Kohlberg
Kravis and Roberts (KKR). KKR formalized the model of the LBO firm—a type of busi-
ness that later became known as private equity. The success of KKR has attracted many
competitors and led to a segment of the financial services industry we know today as the
private equity business.
PRIVATE EQUITY MARKET
Private equity firms provided a substantial part of the fuel for the M&A boom that
occurred during 2003–2007. Private equity declined with the fallout from the
subprime crisis but steadily rebounded as the recovery took hold (see Figure 9.1).

investments from various large investors where the funds will be invested in equity posi-
tions in companies. When these investments acquire 100% of the outstanding equity
of a public company, we have a going-private transaction. When the equity is acquired
through the use of some of the investment capital of the private equity fund but mainly
borrowed funds, we tend to call such a deal a leveraged buyout (LBO). The fact that such
deals are very common investments for private equity funds has led some to call these
funds LBO funds. Private equity funds may make other investments, such as providing
venture capital to nascent businesses. Funds established for this purpose are sometimes
called venture capital funds. These investments might exclusively use the fund’s capi-
tal and not necessarily use borrowed funds. Having such an equity investment, how-
ever, may enable the target company itself to have improved access to debt markets after
it secures the equity investment from the private equity fund. The fund might take a
minority or a majority position in the company. Usually, venture capital investments
contain incentives, such as stock options, that enable the investor who assumes the risk
to enjoy greater profits if the business turns out to be successful. However, there are

many important differences between private equity funds and venture capital funds. We
will discuss these shortly.
Private equity funds seek out investments that are undervalued. These could be
whole companies that are not trading at values commensurate with what the fund
managers think is possible. They could also be divisions of companies that want to sell
the units due to a change in strategy or a need for cash. This was the case in 2002,
for example, when the international liquor conglomerate Diageo, the marketer of
brands such as Smirnoff vodka, Guinness beer, and Cuervo tequila, finally came to the
realization that there probably was not a lot of synergy between the liquor brands just
mentioned and the burgers and fries that were sold at its Burger King division. The
Texas Pacific Group and Goldman Sachs Group purchased Burger King from Diageo in
2002 for $1.5 billion.
In general, private equity fund managers raise capital from a variety of institutional
investors. They typically charge their investors “2 and 20.” This refers to 2% of invested
capital and 20% of profits. The 20% of profits is referred to as carried interest. We will
discuss the various sources of income that private equity firms earn a little later in
this chapter.
Private Equity Funds Compared to Venture Capital Funds
It is useful to compare private equity funds with venture capital funds, as they really are
both users of private equity. Both are organized as limited partnerships, with the general
partner making the investment decisions. However, there are several very significant
differences between the two.
Venture funds often make investments in new companies that may have limited
revenues. The companies they invest in are often startups. Private equity firms seek out
more established companies that have lengthy revenue, if not a profit, history.
It is not unusual to see several venture funds invest together in a syndicated
manner. While this can also occur in private equity deals (as we will discuss later), it
is much less common. In addition, in the venture capital business we may have several
rounds of funding as a company goes through stages in its development and passes spe-
cific milestones. In a private equity acquisition, the fund typically acquires a company,
holds the business for a period of time, and then sells it off—hopefully at a profit.
The investment horizon for venture funds can be shorter, and additional capital
is provided only if the company meets the aforementioned milestones. If the company
fails to achieve these goals, such as progress in development of a certain technology or
progress in the development of a specific pharmaceutical product, the venture capitalist
may simply walk away.
It is common with venture capital investments that the business needs multiple
rounds of funding over its life. However, most private equity acquisitions are self-funding
and are able to maintain themselves through their own self-generated cash flows.
There is usually much more uncertainty about the success of companies venture
capitalists invest in. Roughly one-half of all venture capital–funded companies fail.
This is why some research studies have showed that the alpha generated by venture
capital investments can be high.1 Researchers in this area also clearly understand that

3–52.

selection bias, which refers to doing an analysis only on survivors and leaving out the
returns of companies that may have ceased to exist, may give their results an upward
bias.2 However, when researchers such as John Cochrane of the University of Chicago
took steps to attenuate this bias, the mean arithmetic returns were much lower (698%
to 59%—not a typo) and the arithmetic mean alpha was 32% (down from 462%).
Unlike venture capital investments, a business failure of a private equity acquired
business is much less common. However, it happens—sometimes on a huge scale. TPG
lost all its investment in Washington Mutual, GMAC, and in the disastrous buyout
of TXU Corp., in which TPG partnered with KKR and Goldman Sachs to acquire the
company for $45 billion. That deal was the biggest LBO in history and ended up in
bankruptcy under its mountain of LBO debt. While such private equity busts receive
many headlines, they are not all that common. This is due to the fact that the companies
that they invest in tend to have similar risk characteristics to the market overall. This
was underscored by Susan Woodward, who found that private equity investments had
an average beta of 0.86—meaning they are less risky than the market.3 She contrasted
this with a beta for venture capital investments of 2.0.
AVAYA AND PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS CHALLENGES
IN ASSESSING RISK OF BUYOUT TARGETS
S
ometimes investments that seem boring and low risk can have risks that are
difﬁcult to assess. This was the case with TPG’s and Silver Lake Partners’ failed
$8 billion buyout of Avaya, Inc. in 2007. Avaya was once part of Lucent and AT&T
(before there was a Lucent). This was a company that was in the business of installing
and managing telephone systems—mainly for corporations. On the surface, one
would think that its performance would move with the performance of business and
the economy in general. However, the company was weighed down by a debt load
that was greater than $6 billion. It was also slowed by aggressive competition from
more nimble, cloud-based ﬁrms in addition to the networking giant Cisco.
In January 2017, Avaya ﬁled for bankruptcy protection. What is amazing is how
experienced private equity ﬁrms, such as TPG and Silver Lake, could not sense
in advance that this company, which operates in a highly competitive industry
and which is subject to rapid technological changes that can make product offer-
ings quickly obsolete, was not a good candidate to take on a burdensome debt
load. However, this would not be their only busted deal. In fact, in the same year,
2007, TPG, along with KKR and the buyout unit of Goldman Sachs, did the buyout
TXU—the largest LBO bust of all time. It is amazing that investors, mainly institu-
tions, are so forgiving of such huge blunders. Obviously, if it was their own money,
instead of monies of nameless retirees, they might be much more careful with their
investment capital.

Seller versus Private Equity Fund Valuations and Negotiations
In order for private equity firms to generate an acceptable return for their investors,
they need to be able to purchase target companies at prices that allow them to achieve
a particular hurdle rate. When private equity firms believe that a target has been poorly
managed, there may be a greater gap between the value that the private equity firm
believes it can readily achieve through the installation of a new management team and
the enactment of certain necessary changes in company operations, and the current
value of the target based on its unadjusted future cash flows. This gap may provide
the basis for some flexibility in negotiations and allow for an agreed-on price. How-
ever, when the target has been reasonably well-managed and both are aware of the
risk-adjusted present value of the company’s cash flows, there is less room to provide
the seller with the full value of the company while allowing private equity buyers an
opportunity to generate a good return on their investment. An example of this occurred
in 2006 when the Salt Lake City–based Huntsman Corp., a $13 billion industrial com-
pany, broke off negotiations with private equity firm Apollo Management LP. Huntsman,
which lost money in 2005 and could not come to terms with Apollo at a price that the
private equity firm believed made sense. The same result occurred in late 2005, when
the grocery-store chain Albertsons could not initially agree on terms with a group of
private equity buyers. This led the bidders to back away from Albertsons, and later that
year a deal was struck with an investment group to sell the company for a revised price
of $10.97 billion. Sellers who are seeking to offer their companies to private equity firms
have to be willing to accept a price that will allow these firms some room to gener-
ate a return with another sale of the business in a few years. While they are certainly
not immune from making valuation mistakes, private equity buyers tend to be careful
not to overpay, as their gains mainly come from the difference between their purchase
price and an eventual resale price, plus any monies extracted from the company prior to
that resale.
Deals Outside Auctions and Proprietary Deals
Private equity firms are oftentimes approached by dealmakers, such as investment
bankers, who may represent a potential seller who is looking for a clean and smooth
sale and is not interested in a very public auction process. These bankers may represent
that they have a proprietary deal that the private equity buyer may be interested
in. However, when the potential seller is a public company, this deal may only be
temporarily a proprietary one, as Revlon duties may soon kick in. Private equity
firms tend to be quite knowledgeable about M&A law and the times when an auc-
tion may be required. Nonetheless, occasionally, such as when a founder who holds
considerable equity in the company wants to sell in a quick and smooth transaction,
such deals may be more appealing to private equity firms. However, deals outside of
auctions tend to be the clear minority. It is also important to recall, as we already
discussed, how there can be a competitive bidding process occurring even prior to
a public announcement of the potential sale of a company and the start of a more
formal auction.

The Private Equity Market
Private versus Public Deals
When one thinks about the private equity business, the stereotypical deal has been the
large-scale, going-private transaction involving a public target. That is still an impor-
tant part of the private equity business, but the more common transactions are private
deals. These involve acquisitions from founders of businesses, other sponsors, or venture
capital–sponsored firms. This trend has grown significantly over the past decade.
The increasing prevalence of private sellers, especially closely held founders, has
provided private equity buyers with increased risk. Part of the reason for that is that
many of these deals include a survival clause, which may indicate that the representa-
tions made by the seller (representations that the buyer may have used to come up with
a purchase price the seller accepted) may survive for only a limited time after the clos-
ing period. Such clauses may be more normal in acquisitions of public companies that
have operated under the U.S. securities laws and the penalties imposed for false financial
disclosure during the life of the company. However, in acquisitions of private companies,
a whole host of concerns about the reliability of the data in the seller’s financials may
arise. We discuss this further in Chapter 15 when we discuss the differences in valuing
private versus public companies.
Survivability clauses became an ever-greater concern for buyers in 2011 when the
Delaware Chancery Court ruled that the survival clause served as a kind of statute of
limitations on the ability of the buyer to pursue breach of contract claims.4 Other states,
such as New York as well as California, however, have not agreed with Delaware’s view
regarding whether such clauses can be so limiting.5
Private equity buyers have dealt with this change by securing representations
and warranties insurance. Such insurance used to be very customized and was
time-consuming to secure. Now, with the newfound demand from private deals, bro-
kers of such insurance, such as Marsh McLennan, are well aware of the characteristics
of these policies that buyers want and have become more comfortable creating and
pricing them. In addition, the insurance companies that these brokers work with, such
as AIG, Concord, Allied World, and Ambridge, have paid out claims so buyers of policies
are more comfortable with the belief that, if they have a problem and need to rely on
their insurance, it likely will pay. For larger policies, such as those in the $100 million
range, buyers may need to syndicate the policy and involve multiple insurance carriers
to bind the level of insurance they believe they need.
While clauses like survival clauses are newer to many U.S. private equity buyers,
they are really fairly common in Europe. In Europe, management, which may have
some equity in the deal, may bear this responsibility. In the United States as well,
though, when managers realize that after the deal goes through they will have a new
employer, they may on their own make certain relevant disclosures or may tone down
overly aggressively representations made by the seller so that they are not left with a set
of very unhappy bosses.

Another trend is that representatives of private sellers are including in agreements
with private equity buyers more significant reverse breakup fees. This can create an incen-
tive to make sure the buyer pushes its bankers to provide the needed debt capital to
complete the deal. Later in this chapter, we will discuss the rising activism and involve-
ment of limited partners. LPs invest in private equity funds to get deals done that will
maximize their return. It is very uncomfortable for private equity firms to have to inform
their LPs that they are cutting a check to a seller using the equity in the fund, and not
only will the LPs not make a return on that capital, but also they will never even get it
back. Both the general partners and their limited partners know this now requires much
more superior performance from the rest of their investments to offset this loss. There-
fore, large reverse breakup fees provide great incentives for private equity firms to get
deals done and not have to be in such an awkward position with their LPs.
Leading Private Equity Firms
A private equity firm may raise capital to build several different funds. Based on
investors’ participation in the fund, they will receive a proportion of the return that the
fund enjoyed, less the management fees for running the fund. Table 9.1 lists some of
the leading private equity funds and their net revenues and share of the market.
Structure of a Private Equity Fund
Private equity funds are usually established as limited partnerships run by a general
partner (GP), the private equity firm, and a number of investors or limited partners (LPs).
In large funds, there may be as many as 30 or 40 different LPs. The general and limited
partners enter into agreements when the fund is formed. These agreements provide for
how the partners are going to profit from the investments that the funds make. Some-
times, some LPs are able to negotiate MFNs, “most favored nation” agreements, with

the fund. These MFNs may provide certain investors with special rights or information.
Sometimes, they are used to get larger monetary commitments or to get an initial invest-
ment to “kickstart” the capital raising process.
Private equity funds may tie up their investors’ capital for an extended time period,
such as 10 years, which is the typical lifetime of a fund. However, the agreements usually
require them to invest the capital within three to five years. That time period is referred
to as the investment period. As a result of the Great Recession and weak economy that
followed, several large private equity firms struggled to find acceptable investments. This
became an issue for many private equity firms, such as TPG and the Carlyle Group,
which raised large sums in 2006 and 2007 but which had billions of uncommitted
capital in 2010 when the M&A business was weak. As the economy recovered, more
takeover opportunities appeared.
Compensation of Private Equity GPs
The general partners of a private equity fund can earn fixed income, which is indepen-
dent of the performance of the fund, and variable income, which is a function of that
performance. Management fees, which are fixed, are paid from what is called committed
capital, which is the money provided by the limited partners. Committed capital is com-
posed of lifetime fees and investment capital. Management fee agreements between the GP
and the LPs can vary. They could be a fixed percentage over the life of the fund, or, more
commonly, it could decline over that time period. The fees themselves are calculated by
applying the relevant percentage to some base, which could be committed capital or
some alternative, such as net invested capital, which is defined as invested capital, the
capital that has already been invested, less the cost basis of investments that have been
disposed of.
Variable Fees: Carried Interest
In addition to fixed management fees, GPs earn income from several variable or
performance-based sources. Principal among these is the controversial carried interest,
which, simply stated, is earned from gains on the transactions conducted by the GP.
How GPs can make income from this source varies as a function of the agreement with
the LPs. For example, it could be that the GP does not earn any of this type of income
until the LPs have received back their capital. This amount could be higher if a hurdle
rate was agreed to. This is a threshold rate of return—let’s say 6%—that is applied
to the committed capital. If, for example, we assume that the LPs committed $250
million to the fund, and proceeds from exited investments totaled $300 million, then
the LPs would receive not only their $250 million back but also 6% of that amount, $15
million, before a percentage of the remaining gains, $35 million ($300 million−$265
million), would be paid to the GP.
The percentage of the applicable profits that is used to calculate the GPs’ earnings
is called the carry level. A common carry level is 20%. We often hear that GPs are paid
based on 2/20. The 2 would be the fixed percentage, and the 20 would be the variable
component based on the 20% carry level.

Sometimes GPs are allowed to take some profits early, and this is determined by what
is called the carry timing. However, if later performance does not allow the LPs to receive
back their capital and possibly an amount based on the hurdle rate, then the LPs may
be able to get back some of these early paid profits if the original agreements between
the GP and the LPs included clawback provisions.
Variable Fees: Monitoring and Transactions Fees
Monitoring and transaction fees make up the remainder of the variable income the GPs
receive. The monitoring is done by the GPs, which oversee the operations and perfor-
mance of the companies they have acquired. These fees are usually shared with the
LPs, who receive the bulk of the fees (often 80%). These fees are usually based on some
multiple of a financial performance measure, such as EBITDA.
GPs may charge a transaction fee for each transaction they complete. This can be
structured so that there is a total transaction fee and part of the total is shared with
the LPs.
LP “Activism” and the Evolving Private Equity Business
Investors in private equity funds, the so-called LPs, used to be relatively passive
investors who invested their capital and waited for the seemingly automatic high
returns. The strong equity markets enabled private equity managers, the general
partners, to more easily be able to meet the expectations of the clients—the LPs. This all
changed when the economy and market turned down. Now private equity managers
have to work harder for their returns and they find themselves under closer scrutiny
from the LPs. The LPs want more detailed explanations, and want to know more about
how a transaction will generate good returns; they want to be updated on the progress
toward this goal. This is particularly true of government pension fund LPs and may be a
bit less true for university endowment LPs. Government pension funds are the leading
providers of capital to private equity funds (see Table 9.2).
While LPs are more active than they used to be, this is relative, as in the past they
were almost totally inactive. Part of that activism is requiring private equity firms to
eliminate some of the charges that had tended in the past to slip past nonattentive LPs.
As we have noted, when the market is strong and LPs realize good returns, such as in
2013–2014,LPstendtobelessvigilantinmonitoringfeesandexpenseschargedbyGPs.
This is unfortunate as LPs, such as pension funds, owe an obligation to the employees
they represent to receive the highest returns they can and to prevent GPs from siphoning
off monies through fees the LPs should not have agreed to pay if they read and negoti-
ated the investment agreements more closely. This is an issue that the Securities and
Exchange Commission has been focusing on more.
The situation began to change in 2014 when some pension funds demanded better
explanations and justifications from private equity funds they had invested in regarding
the fees and expenses they were charged. This came at a time when the SEC was taking
a closer look at the private equity business. The Dodd-Frank legislation passed in 2010
required that private equity firms with more than $150 million in assets had to register

examine the private equity business, and it began to express concerns about the nature
of its practices and the way fees and expenses are allocation to LPs.
Some LPs wanted to hire an independent advisor to look over the various fees the
funds had charged. Naturally, several funds resisted, as they were used to the lucrative
world where they passed on charges to LPs who never questioned them. Remember, the
LPs are investing other people’s money, and if they do not get the best return for them,
they will likely not be personally affected. The GPs, however, stand to personally gain
from more of the return they can extract for themselves. Some funds also demanded
that the terms of the GPs’ compensation agreements be kept secret. Some GPs stated
that if the terms were revealed, they would not accept future investments from certain
LPs. It seems now that LPs are finally waking up and taking a more aggressive stance
toward some GPs.
Expansion and Diversiﬁcation of Large Private Equity Firms
On the sponsor side, another trend that has been noticeable is the expansion and diver-
sification of large private equity firms outside of traditional purely private equity invest-
ments. Many, such as Blackstone, have really become global asset managers. Some have
sought to emphasize this in their capital raising and have moved away from the use of
the term private equity and prefer alternative asset managers.
Another obvious trend has been global expansion outside of what was the tradi-
tional bailiwick of private equity firms, the United States and Europe, and into growth
areas of Asia and Latin and South America. As an example of this trend, as of 2014 TPG
has as many offices in China (four) as it does in the United States. This global expansion
was brought on by the fact that private equity funds struggled to find fruitful investments
when the Great Recession consumed the United States, and then as the U.S. economy

slowly recovered, Europe went into its sovereign debt crisis. If large private equity firms
were going to meet investor return expectations, it became imperative to go where the
growth is.
Private Equity Fund Partnerships and “Club Deals”
Private equity funds may acquire stock in a target company individually or they may
combine with other private equity firms to acquire a target. These types of deals are
sometimes referred to as club deals or consortium deals. The combinations enable them
to spread out the risk. This may be necessary as many funds require that no more than
a certain percentage, such as 10%, of a fund’s assets be invested in any particular invest-
ment. For 100% acquisition, a $10 billion fund—a large private equity firm by any
standards—would then be limited to acquisitions no larger than $1 billion if it chose
not to utilize debt to complete the transactions. For this reason, it may choose to join
forces with other private equity firms when it is attempting to complete a large acquisi-
tion. As an example, in March 2005, Silver Lake Partners completed the second-largest
LBO up to that time when it combined with six other private equity firms to acquire Sun-
gard Data Systems for $10.8 billion. The other private equity firms that participated in
the takeover were the Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts (KKR), Texas Pacific
Group (TPG), Goldman Sachs Partners, and Providence Equity Partners.
Private equity firms have become so involved in takeovers that they find themselves
forming competing groups or partnerships and bidding against each other for takeover
targets. This was the case in August 2005, when KKR joined forces with Silverlake Part-
ners to acquire Agilent Technologies Inc.’s semiconductor products business for $2.6
billion. This company was spun off by Hewlett-Packard in 1999 as part of a focusing
strategy. Agilent itself was pursuing a focusing strategy in 2005 when it decided to try
to sell its chip unit and lighting business. The company’s CEO, William Sullivan, stated
that Agilent, being a diversified company, was “trading at a 25% to 35% discount to”
its peers.6 He believed that giving the company increased focus through sell-offs such as
this would lower the discount that the market was applying to his company. KKR and
Silverlake won the contest in which they were bidding against two other buyout groups:
one that featured Bain Capital and Warburg Pincus and another that had Texas Pacific
Group, CVC Partners, and Francisco Partners as participants.
Some have argued that the club deals tend to lower the pool of potential demanders
for target companies, thereby lowering the prices that targets receive in the market. This
was the finding of a study by Officer, Ozbas, and Sensoy.7 They found that target share-
holders receive 10% less of pre-bid value and 40% lower premiums! They conclude with
concerns that private equity buyers may be colluding to lower prices they pay for targets.
The Officer et al. results were not consistent with other results, such as those of
Boone and Mulherin, who failed to find lower target prices.8 They analyzed a sample

of 870 publicly traded targets over the period 2003–2007. They attributed their results,
in part, to changes in the market such as the increased use of go-shop provisions and the
availability of stapled financing—the latter of which could eliminate some of the benefits
club deals may have over single buyers.
Club or consortium deals have become less popular in recent years. Private equity

they acquire the target by themselves, dealing with other owners can make the trans-
action and the management and subsequent sale more complicated. Differing views on
how the company should be managed and the appropriate time and way to seek an exit
have made more private equity firms bypass this option.
SIMMONS BEDDING COMPANY
T
he fate of the Simmons Bedding company is not one that the private equity
industry can be proud of. In 2003, the company was acquired by Thomas H. Lee
Partners of Boston. Simmons was originally founded in Wisconsin with headquarters
in Atlanta, and had been in existence for 133 years before it had to ﬁle Chapter 11 in
2009. It boasted such leading industry products as the Simmons Beautyrest mattress.
However storied its products were, the company could not sustain the bloated debt
load that different private equity buyers had imposed on it over the years. During
its ownership of Simmons, Thomas Lee caused the company to take on $375 million
in debt, which more than repaid Thomas Lee’s cash investment in the initial buyout.
The mattress business is cyclical and tends to suffer when the economy turns
down. Like other companies that private equity buyers had loaded up with debt to
ﬁnance their dividend cash extractions, Simmons could not service the debt. Instead
of the debt proceeds providing cash to operations or being invested in a way to
make the company more productive, debt used for dividend recapitalizations helps
only the private equity buyers, not the company itself. In the case of Simmons,
the company could not afford to be a cash cow for its owners and still stay out of
bankruptcy when the economy inevitably turned down.
Private Equity Business Model
While some of the leading names in finance work in this industry and often earn incred-
ibly lucrative compensation, the business model is a relatively simple one. The first step
in the process for private equity buyers is to have contacts with investors and sales skills
that will enable them to convince institutional investors to invest a portion of their cap-
ital into one of their private equity funds. The next step is to find undervalued targets.
Here they can be indirectly aided by poor management in the target company, perhaps
facilitated by weak corporate governance, where the managers may have run the com-
pany in a manner that suppressed its potential. Once an acceptable target is found, and
an acquisition price is agreed to, the GPs secure the debt capital using relationships
they have with various banks. The recent expansionary monetary policy for the Federal
Reserve and global central banks helped funds to acquire this capital at very low rates.

Private Equity Market
◾
357
Private equity buyers use the cheap debt to buy undervalued targets. It helps if the
targets do not already have significant debt, as the buyers may want to have the target
acquire more debt, which they can use to pay themselves a “dividend.” As we discussed,
they oversee the acquired company, which is run by its own management, and charge
the monitoring fees for this oversight.
An ideal environment for private equity firms is one where the market is rising. This
allows them to buy at one price, and then a few years later, maybe even earlier, they will
sell the target in an elevated market at a higher price than what they paid.
The next step in the process is to conduct this business in a good economy with a
risingmarket.Consistentwiththesayingthatarisingtidecarrieswithitallships,private
equity buyers hope that the rising market will uplift the value of their now debt-laden
target. Once they perceive an opportune moment they “flip” the target, higher debt and
all, onto a buyer. The high leverage they used to finance the deal—and in the 2000s this
was done at low costs—magnifies their returns on the relatively small equity investment
they made.
When the market is rising, such as in 2013–2017, and the cost of debt is low
with an ample supply of capital available, the results can be favorable for the private
equity industry. On the surface, the dealmakers may seem like wizards (and they expect
out-of-this-world compensation for their wizardry), but the steps in the process are
quite simple.
Alternative Private Equity Exit Strategies
There are several ways a private equity buyer can exit from an investment. One is
through a sale to a corporate buyer that sees the acquisition as a complement to its
overall business strategy. These buyers are sometimes referred to as strategic buyers.
Such buyers have been traditionally the mainstay of private equity exits. However,
when the economy is weak, as it was during the Great Recession of 2008–2009 and
the weak recovery that followed, these buyers can be more difficult to find. During such
periods companies are not looking to expand and aggressively pursue their strategic
growth plan as they become more risk-averse when they see their sales growth and
overall economic growth are weak. However, as the U.S. economy began to grow more
steadily in 2012–2014, and U.S. corporate treasuries became flush with cash, strategic
buyers returned, albeit cautiously, to the M&A market.
Another exit strategy is a sponsor-to-sponsor deal, where one private equity firm
sells a prior acquisition to another private equity firm. These deals can be popular
in a market where there is abundant private equity capital in funds seeking deals,
while there are also other private equity firms looking to generate returns from prior
acquisitions.
Still another exit strategy is a public offering. Here the private equity firm sponsors
a public offering in the stock it owns in its prior acquisition. The viability of this avenue
is very much dependent on the vitality of the equities markets and the IPO market in
particular. In 2013, offerings by private equity firms were roughly half of all IPOs (see
Figure 9.2).

Dividend Recapitalizations
Private equity firms generate returns from their portfolio companies in more ways
than just cashing out the investment when it is sold. In recent years we are seeing
private equity firms engaging in “dividend recapitalizations.” This is when private
equity firms that have acquired companies take on more debt, such as through issuing
bonds and using the proceeds to pay a dividend to the fund investors. This was the case
in September 2004, when KKR had PanAmSat issue $250 million in notes that were
used to pay the investors who bought the firm just one month prior for $4.3 billion.
In the aforementioned purchase of Burger King by private equity investors, the buyers
paid themselves a $400 million special dividend in 2006, which Burger King financed
through the assumption of approximately $350 million in debt. In May 2006, Burger
King did a $425 million IPO, which offset the substantial debt the company had taken
on to pay the dividend. The combination of the dividend and their share of the private
equity proceeds were reported to eventually provide the private equity investors with a
115% return on their three-year-plus investment!9

Debt Financing and Use of “Covenant-Lite” Loans
During the heyday of the private equity era, 2003–2007, private equity firms were able
to negotiate very favorable conditions with the lender, banks that they had relationships
with and to which they brought a lot of business. In addition, many banks felt confident
based on the very good economic environment and their own inability to understand
how a business cycle works. Part of these favorable conditions involved the granting of
covenant-lite loans, which feature a lack of restrictive covenants that require certain
financial performance, such as the maintenance of specific financial ratios. The loan
agreements could even be so liberal that they may forgive in advance certain violations
of the agreement by the borrower. In exchange, they may allow the GP to “cure” trans-
gressions by adding more equity to the target.
While lenders were quite flexible during the 2003–2007 private equity boom times,
they became much more restrictive when the economy collapsed after the subprime
crisis.
Bridge Financing
Inthecontextofprivateequitytransactions,bridgefinancingiscapitalthatisprovidedto
allow the GPs to complete the deal while they wait for long-term financing to be worked
out. To do this, the private equity firm secures a commitment from an investment bank.
Ideally, the private equity GPs and the bank hope the bridge financing will not be neces-
sary, as they will be able to syndicate a bank credit facility or simply float an offering of
junk bonds.
Bridge financing is riskier than longer-term financing that is associated with a
closed deal. For this reason, private equity firms try to avoid using it.
Once the debt availability has been agreed to, the private equity firm is in a position
to make a commitment to the seller. Part of this commitment is the equity they will put
into the deal. Sometimes, if the private equity firm does not have immediate access to the
total amount of equity capital needed to complete the deal, it may go to a bank and ask
it to temporarily provide the additional needed equity—called bridge equity. Obviously,
the recipient has to pay the bank the necessary fees to make this equity capital avail-
able.Oncethebankmakesthecommitment,thenacommitmentforthetotalacquisition

Impact of Delaware General Corporation Law Rule 251h
Private equity buyers have long been in a disadvantageous position relative to strate-
gic buyers when it comes to tender offers. Private equity buyers face the risk that the
deal would or would not be approved by selling stockholders in a closing-out second-step
transaction. Private equity bidders have to secure bridge financing without the benefit
of the assets of the target for collateral support, as they do not get such access and sup-
port until the deal is completed. Such bridge financing can be expensive, and this caused
many private equity firms to avoid the tender offer.
In Chapter 6, we discussed Rule 251h, which allowed buyers that receive a simple
majority of a target’s shares in a tender offer to quickly close rather than to wait for

a shareholder vote. The rule improved the competitive landscape for financial buyers,
such as private equity firms, or strategic buyers who are using debt financing compared
to strategic buyers who may be using their own cash or stock. It reduced the potential of
expensive time delays that significantly added to costs and uncertainty in the takeover
process—especially for leveraged deals.
COMPUTING PRIVATE EQUITY INTERNAL RATES OF RETURN
As we will discuss shortly, some researchers have an issue with how returns of private
equity funds are computed. However, it is useful to initially note how internal rates
of return for private equity funds are computed. First, using the Guidance Statement
on Private Equity established by the CFA Institute, equation 9.1 depicts an annualized
internal rate of return:10
VE =
[
VBX(1 + rIRR)
TD

]
+
I∑
i=1
[
CFiX(1 + rIRR)
ti

]
,
(9.1)
where
VB = value of the investment at the beginning of the measurement period
VE = value of the investment at the end of the measurement period
CFi = cash flow i (positive values for inflows and negative values for outflows)
i = number of cash flows (1, 2, … , I) during the measurement period
rIRR = annualized internal rate of return
ti = number of calendar days from the day when the cash flow i occurred to the
end of the measurement period
TD = total number of calendar days within the measurement period
Sometimes, however, it may be useful to also see a nonannualized version, such
as when an investment covers only part of a year and there is no guarantee that pro-
ceeds from a given investment could be reinvested at the same rate for the remainder
of the period. When that is an issue, we look to a nonannualized version, such as that
shown here.
The same CFA Institute standards show the computation of a nonannualized ver-
sion −a since inception internal rate of return (SI-IRR) as follows:
RIRR =

rIRR = annualized internal rate of return
TD = total number of calendar days within the measurement period
The foregoing calculations seem very straightforward, yet very interesting issues
arise when researchers actually go about dealing with the data and using it to do the
requisite computations. For example, how do we handle investments that have not been
exited as of the end of the study period? Do we simply accept values provided by the
private equity fund regarding what they should be worth? What if these investments
were of an age when they should have been liquidated, and they have not been cash
flow–positive for some time? Do we still accept the fund’s representations, or should the
researchers simply write them off and make them zero?
CHARACTERISTICS OF PRIVATE EQUITY RETURNS
Research on private equity returns has evolved over the years. An early study by Kaplan
and Schoar calculated internal rates of return generated by private equity fund’s cash
flows and compared them to a public market equivalent. This public market equivalent
assumed that cash flows of funds were invested in the S&P500. They found that private
equity returns were roughly similar to that of the market, as reflected the S&P500.11
In light of the significant fees that private equity funds charge, this study cast doubts
about the value of the private equity industry. However, later research utilized a
methodology similar to Kaplan and Schoar but applied it to newer datasets and, as we
will discuss, found returns in excess of the market return.
Kaplan and Schoar did find that private equity returns were persistent. By persistent
is meant that the funds of general partners that outperformed the market in a given
year were more likely to continue to outperform in succeeding years. Kaplan and Schoar
reached this conclusion through a regression analysis that sought to determine if the
coefficient in equation 9.3 was statistically significant and positive.12
PiN = α + βPiN−1 + €iN
(9.3)
where
PiN = performance of fund N, which is managed by private equity firm i
PiN−1 = performance of fund N – 1, which is managed by private equity firm i
11 Steven N. Kaplan and Antoinette Schoar, “Returns, Persistence and Capital Flows,” Journal of Finance 60,
no. 4 (August 2005): 1791–1823.
12 Kaplan and Schoar actually ran various regressions that included more lagged performance variables as
well as other explanatory variables such as fund size.

◾
The Private Equity Market
The findings of persistence of private equity fund returns contrasts with research
on mutual fund managers, which does not show persistence of their returns. Later
research focused on how long term the persistence was. Chung regressed PiN on PiN−2
and found a weaker relationship.13 That is, Chung found performance was persistent for
the first follow-on fund but not subsequent ones. This implies that if persistence exists,
it may be short-lived. Another issue for LPs is whether the persistent performance of
some private equity funds and specific managers is “investable.” Investable persistence
reflects the ability of LPs to identify superior PE firms and managers. If LPs can’t do that,
then the existence of persistence is not as valuable. Korteweg and Sorensen analyzed a
large sample of 1,924 funds raised during the period 1969–2001 and managed by 891
firms.14 Their sample included buyout funds and venture capital funds. While they did
find a significant amount of persistence, even long-term persistence, they found that
past performance was quite “noisy” and also that luck clearly played an important role.
Thus, the ability of LPs to identify the persistent performance of some funds was limited.
This was particularly true for venture capital funds (see Figure 9.3).
While there is evidence from several studies that private equity returns tend to be
persistent, there is some basis to believe that this persistence has declined over time.
Braun, Jenkinson, and Stoff analyzed a sample of 13,523 portfolio investments by 865
buyout funds.15 They found persistence but also found that this persistence declined

as the private equity industry evolved and as there was more competition among PE
firms. This is a very intuitive finding right out of Economics 101. When there were
fewer PE firms, there was less competition for the more attractive target company
investments. However, as PE firms thrived and generated superior and persistent
returns for their LP investors, new PE firms entered the market even though there
was not necessarily any major increase in the number of attractive acquisition targets
available. Money continued to flow into the industry and the natural result was that
less profitable targets get acquired and these acquisitions bring down the returns of
many PE portfolios.
One of the challenges of valuations of private equity funds’ performance is that there
usually is not a liquid market for the assets of such funds. Therefore, the investors, the
limited partners of the funds, and researchers have to use the fund’s own estimates of
net asset values (NAVs) which are produced in quarterly reports of these funds. Another
challenge to determining the performance of funds is that an accurate value will only
be known after all the assets in the fund are sold and this may take a decade. These
problems open the door to manipulation of these asset values by some funds. One of
the solutions certain funds have been pursuing is to have NAVs determined by outside
valuation consultants.
In an effort to shed further light on actual PE returns, Phalippou and Gottschalg
explored the private equity return calculations of prior research.16 They used an
expanded version of the dataset utilized by Kaplan and Schoar. However, they changed
the way that residual values were treated. Kaplan and Schoar accepted the residual
values of unexited investments as of the sample study period put forward by private
equity firms and, therefore, treated them as positive cash inflows. It was generally
thought that this would not have a significant impact for mature funds. However,
Phalippou and Gottschalg pointed out that these investments had reached their normal
liquidation date, and most of the time they had not generated positive cash flows for
some time prior to that. They contend that such values should be written off. When they
are written off, the average fund’s Profitability Index declines by 7%! Based on these
and other computational adjustments, they found that the average fund underperformed
the S&P 500 by 3% after taking fees into account, even though gross of fees they
outperformed this index by 3%.
The Kaplan and Schoar 2005 study utilized a dataset developed by Venture Eco-
nomics and which was drawn from the years 1980–2001. The private equity industry
in the 1980s was not that large by today’s standards, although it grew significantly in
the 1990s. It continued to grow impressively in the 2000s, with the exception of the
downturn associated with the subprime crisis and the Great Recession. This raises the
obvious question—if returns are roughly only equal to the market, why would there be
continued growth in monies in pursuit of private equity investments? Could the returns
found in early research be lower than the returns experienced in later years?

The Private Equity Market
Later research utilized newer datasets, such as ones from Cambridge Associates,
BurgessandPrequin.Studiesusingthesenewerdatasetstendtoshowthatprivateequity
returns outperform private market alternatives after deductions of fees (and of course
generate even higher pre-fees performance).17
Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan analyzed the returns of a large sample of 1,400 buy-
out and venture capital funds over the period 1984–2008.18 They utilized different data
sets, including a new dataset developed by Burgiss. The data on cash flows that were
made available from Burgiss were derived from more than 200 institutional investors
who are the limited partners in various funds.
Their results showed that private equity funds consistently outperformed the
market, as measured by the S&P500, by between 20% and 27% over the average
fund’s life and by greater than 3% annually. To make such market comparisons, Harris
et al. utilized the Kapan and Schoar 2005 methodology and computed the public
market equivalent (PMEs). Like Kaplan and Schoar, to compute PMEs, they compare an
investment in a given private equity fund to an equivalently timed investment in the
S&P500. The PMEs can be expressed as a multiple so that, for example, a PME of 1.15
implies that by the end of a given fund’s life the investors in the fund derived 15% more
than what they would have had they invested in the S&P500.
Above-market performance is what would be expected and also warranted, given
the nature of private equity investments, which are less liquid than broad market invest-
ments. With respect to venture capital (VC) fund investments, Harris et al. found that
the average VC fund underperformed relative to the market by approximately 5% over
the life of the average fund.
The findings of various studies which showed that private equity returns exceed
the performance of the market, however, are tempered by the concerns expressed by
the research of Phalippou and Gottschalg, who showed how inaccurate valuations of
some NAVs may result in overstatements of some fund returns. Evaluations of fund per-
formance are very important to the private equity industry as good performance allows
GPs to raise follow-on funds. Surveys of LPs confirm that they rely on performance data
provided by GPs in deciding on investing in follow-on funds.19 One difficulty that LPs
have is that they may have to rely on interim return calculations during the life of one
fund to make a decision about whether to invest in a given GP’s next fund.
Harris, Jenkinson, and Stucke analyzed a large sample of 761 PE investors made
by the pension fund CALPERS, which is the largest investor in PE funds.20 They found
that over the life of the fund, valuations were generally fair if not conservative. However,
during the life of funds they did notice a jump in valuations in the fourth quarters when

funds are audited. They also noticed that when funds were engaging in fund raising for
“the next fund” the valuations of the current fund were inflated. Barber and Yasuda
arrived at similar findings and noted that abnormal returns tended to decline after the
fund-raising period ended.21
The next logical question is, Is the market able to identify and penalize those GPs
who manipulate and overstate their returns? Brown, Gredil, and Kaplan analyzed a
sample of daily cash flows and quarterly NAVs from a sample of 2,071 funds which
they derived from over 200 institutional investors.22 They found that the market may
address this problem on its own. They noticed that GPs which overstated results tended
to have more difficulty raising future capital. In other words, if they “burned” some
LPs through that overstatement of returns, the LPs may not be fooled twice. Brown,
Gerdil, and Kaplan also noticed that the more successful fundraisers tended to not have
significant returns overstatement issues.
REPLICATING PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTING
We have seen that private equity returns tend to exceed those of the market. However,
private equity funds cater to a limited number of investors who are typically large insti-
tutions such as pension funds. They are not open to the average smaller investor. In
addition, private equity returns are also augmented by the aggressive use of leverage
by the funds.
Private equity funds tend to invest in smaller or mid-size companies that have low
EBITDA multiples—basically value stocks. In addition, private equity investments and
returns feature long holding periods and also significant investor activism as private
equity funds typically acquire entire companies and have their representatives on the
board while they handpick the managers. Are there ways for smaller investors to match
private equity returns? This question was addressed by Erik Stafford, who showed that
individual investors can duplicate many of the characteristics of the private equity model
except for activism.23 He found that “portfolios composed of firms with characteristics
similar to those chosen by private equity funds earn high risk-adjusted returns, exceed-
ing the mean pre-fee equity return when target portfolio leverage is chosen to match the
leveraged returns accruing inside private equity funds (see Figure 9.4).”24 In fact, Sum-
merHaven Index Management LLP, using Stafford’s research, now offers an investable
index that seeks to replicate the long-term return characteristics of diversified private
equity funds.25

BOARD INTERLOCKS AND LIKELIHOOD OF TARGETS TO
RECEIVE PRIVATE EQUITY BIDS
In Chapter 13, we will discuss the impact that interlocked boards have on corporate
governance. However, using a sample of all U.S. publicity traded companies over the
years 2000–2007, Stuart and Yim found that when a company had directors that had
previous positive experience in receiving private equity bids while at other companies,
such firms were 42% more likely to receive offers from private equity firms.26 When
the directors had negative experiences with private equity in the past, what they
termed the PE Interlock Effect largely disappeared. They concluded that board members
and the social networks they bring to the board influence which companies become
takeover targets.
SECONDARY MARKET FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS
For some time, there has been a relatively inactive market for private equity investments.
Transactions in this market have come in several forms. An LP could adjust its portfolio
by using this market to get out of certain private equity investments. Part of such a sale
could be not only the investment but also any remaining financial commitments that
were expected to be made by the LP. The buyers of these investments could be institutions

and hedge funds. The extent to which the LP can enter into such a sale is governed by
the investment agreement, which may require the approval of the GP in order for it to be
completed. If the potential seller is a large investor, especially one who has made other
investmentswiththeGPandwithwhomtheGPwantstocontinuetowork,thisapproval
may not be difficult to get. The sale can be relatively seamless, and the partnership can
continue to function undisturbed by a switch of LPs.
In 2014, the secondary market took a step forward when KKR allowed investors
to sell portions of their stakes in buyout funds through a private market managed by
the Nasdaq OMX Group. Institutional investors, such as pension funds, could use this
marketplace to sell some of their private equity investments to other investors, including
smaller investors. Prior to this development, smaller investors who wanted to invest in
privateequitycouldbuysharesinthefewprivateequitycompaniesthathadgonepublic.
These include the Blackstone Group and Carlyle. However, these are shares in the private
equity companies themselves as opposed to investments in specific private equity funds,
which had been the exclusive domain of large institutions.
The new market is in its development phase, but the plans are for it to be open to,
presumably, sophisticated investors with a minimum purchase requirement in the tens
of thousands of dollars. The market should make private equity investments more liquid,
which would logically make capital raising even easier.

CHAPTER TEN
High-Yield Financing and the
Leveraged Loan Market
J
UNK BONDS, ALSO CALLED high-yield bonds, are debt securities that have
ratings below investment grade. For rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s,
this is a rating of BB or worse. The junk bond market is another financing source
that can be used to finance takeovers—especially leveraged takeovers. It played a very
important role in the fourth merger wave, but its importance has diminished in the
years that followed.
HISTORY OF THE JUNK BOND MARKET
Contrary to what some believe, junk bonds were not a creation of the fourth merger
wave. They went by the term low-grade bonds for decades. In the 1930s and 1940s, they
were called “fallen angels.” In the 1960s, some of the lower-grade debt that was issued
to help finance conglomerate acquisitions was referred to as “Chinese paper.” Financier
Meshulam Riklis, chief executive officer (CEO) of Rapid American Corporation, stated
that the term junk bonds first originated in a conversation he had with Michael Milken,
the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert’s junk bond operation. Riklis claimed that
whenMilkensurveyedsomeofthebondsthatRiklishadissued,heexclaimed,“Rik,these
are junk!”1 In the 1920s and 1930s, approximately 17% of all new corporate bond offer-
ings were low-grade/high-yield bonds. A broader range of firms used these securities to
finance their growth. The ranks of the high-yield bonds swelled during the 1930s as the
Great Depression took its toll on many of America’s companies. In 1928, 13% of all out-
standing corporate bonds were low-grade bonds; in 1940, this percentage had risen to

42%.2 Many of the bonds had entered the low-grade class through downgradings from
ratingagencies.(Theratingprocessisdiscussedlaterinthischapter.)Astheeconomyfell
deeper and deeper into the Depression and firms suffered the impact of declining demand
for their goods and services, their ability to service the payments on their outstanding
bonds was called into question. This led to a downgrading of the debt. As the overall level
of economic demand fell, the revenues of some firms declined so much that they could
no longer service the interest and principal payments on the outstanding bonds. As a
result, the default rate on these bonds rose to 10%. Investors became disappointed by the
rising default rate in a category of securities that they believed was generally low-risk.
These investors were previously attracted to the bond market by investment character-
istics such as dependability of income coupled with low risk of default. As the risk of
default rose, low-grade bonds became unpopular.
Bythe1940s,thelow-gradebondmarketstartedtodeclineasoldissueswereretired
or the issuing corporations entered into some form of bankruptcy. The declining popu-
larity of the low-grade bond market made new issues difficult to market. Between 1944
and 1965, high-yield bonds accounted for only 6.5% of total corporate bond issues. This
percentage declined even further as the 1970s began; by the beginning of the decade,
only 4% of all corporate bonds were low-grade bonds. The low-grade/high-yield bond
market’s declining popularity preempted access to one form of debt financing to certain
groups of borrowers. Many corporations that would have preferred to issue long-term
bonds were now forced to borrow from banks in the form of term loans that were gen-
erally of shorter maturity than 20- and 30-year corporate bonds. Those that could not
borrow from a bank on acceptable terms were forced to forsake expansion or to issue
more equity, which had the adverse effect of diluting the shares of ownership for out-
standing equity holders. In addition, the rate of return on equity is generally higher than
debt. Therefore, equity is a more costly source of capital.
The high-yield/low-grade market began to change in the late 1970s. Lehman
Brothers, an investment bank that was itself acquired in the 1980s by Shearson,
underwrote a series of new issues of high-yield corporate debt. These bonds were offered
by Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) ($75 million), Zapata Corporation ($75 million), Fuqua
Industries ($60 million), and Pan American World Airways ($53 million).3 This was
followed by the entrance of a relatively smaller investment bank, Drexel Burnham
Lambert, which started to underwrite issues of low-grade/high-yield debt on a larger
scale. The first such issue that Drexel underwrote was a $30-million issue of bonds on
Texas International Inc. in April 1977.4
Drexel Burnham Lambert’s role in the development was the key to the growth of
the low-grade/high-yield bond market. It served as a market maker for junk bonds, as
they had begun to be called, which was crucial to the dramatic growth of the market.
By 1982, junk bond issuance had grown to $2 billion per year. Just three years later,
in 1985, this total had risen to $14.1 billion and then jumped to $31.9 billion in the

following year. This was the highest level the market reached in the fourth merger wave.
It maintained similar levels until it collapsed in the second half of 1989.
After falling to $1.4 billion in 1990, the market rebounded in 1992 and rose to new
heights in the first half of the 1990s. Although the market thrived in the 1990s, it took a
different form from being a major source of merger and LBO financing, which accounted
for its growth in the fourth merger wave.
Why the Junk Bond Market Grew
The junk bond market experienced dramatic and rapid growth in the 1980s, although
when compared to the decades that followed, this growth would seem modest (see
Figure 10.1).
The fourth wave growth occurred for several reasons. Some of these factors are as
follows:
◾
Privately placed bonds. Prior to the late 1970s, high-yield bonds were privately placed
with institutional investors. These bonds tended to have unique indenture contracts
with restrictive covenants that varied based on what different buyers negotiated.
This lack of standardized contracts made them difficult to market. Even more fun-
damentally, they were not registered with the SEC and could not be publicly traded.
This made them somewhat illiquid. Later, investment bankers such as Drexel Burn-
ham Lambert would recognize this as an opportunity.
◾
Development of market makers. A major factor leading to the growth of this market
was the existence of an active market maker—an entity that serves as an agent of
liquidity in facilitating sales between buyers and sellers. Drexel Burnham Lambert
became a very active market maker in the junk bond market. Drexel’s growth in the
1980s was attributable largely to its involvement in the junk bond market. There-
fore, the firm went to great lengths to ensure the growth and vitality of the market.

◾
High-Yield Financing and the Leveraged Loan Market
◾
Changing risk perceptions. Another factor has been the changing risk perceptions of
investors toward junk bonds. Investors began to believe that the risks associated
with junk bond investments were less than what they once believed. The altered
risk perceptions came as a result of active promotion of this financing vehicle
by interested parties such as Drexel Burnham Lambert and through academic
research. Certain research studies examined the riskiness of junk bonds and
reported that the risk of default was far less than was popularly believed. Some of
these findings would later be challenged by other studies.
◾
Deregulation. A more relaxed regulatory climate enabled the junk bond market to
attract investment capital from traditionally conservative institutional investors,
such as pension funds and thrift institutions. The 1974 Employee Retirement
Income Security Act, and its subsequent interpretations, allowed managers
to invest in a broader range of assets, including riskier securities, as long as
the portfolio was sufficiently diversified. The Garn–St. Germain Act of 1982
allowed thrift institutions to invest in business loans and corporate bonds. While
most thrifts did not invest in corporate bonds, some amassed large portfolios of
these securities.
◾
Merger demand. Yet another factor was the expansion of the field of M&As. As the
targets of M&As as well as LBOs became increasingly larger, the demand for capital
to fund these purchases grew. Investors increasingly relied on the junk bond market
to provide a large part of this funding. In fact, research has showed that over half of
the junk bonds issued in the fourth merger wave were M&A-related.
Historical Role of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Drexel Burnham Lambert was one of the first investment banks to underwrite new-issue
junk bonds and was unique in its efforts to promote the junk bond market as an attrac-
tive investment alternative. These efforts were spearheaded by the former manager of
Drexel’s Beverly Hills office, Michael Milken. Drexel’s unique role as a market maker
became most apparent in 1986, when bondholders accused Morgan Stanley of failing
to make a market for the junk bonds of People Express, which it had previously under-
written. When the price of the bonds fell significantly, Morgan Stanley was reported to
have done little to support them.
Morgan Stanley’s reported passive stance contrasts strongly with Drexel’s aggres-
sive market making in the 1980s. As a result of its involvement in the junk bond market,
Drexel progressed from a second-tier investment banking firm to a major first-tier firm.
The firm’s dominance in the junk bond field during the 1980s made Drexel second only
to Salomon Brothers as an underwriting firm.
Drexel made a market for the junk bonds it had underwritten by cultivating a
number of buyers who could be depended on to purchase a new offering of junk bonds.
The network of buyers for new issues often consisted of previous issuers whose junk
bonds were underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel and Michael Milken
used this network to guarantee a demand for new issues of junk bonds. This guarantee
often came in the form of a commitment letter, indicating that the buyer would buy a

specific amount of a given issue of junk bonds when they were issued. The commitment
fees that the investor might receive were usually less than 1% (i.e., three-quarters of
1%) of the total capital committed. In riskier deals, however, it ranged as high as 2%.
Drexel commanded a dominant 57% of the total market share of new public issues
of junk bonds in 1983 and 40% to 50% from 1984 through the beginning of 1987,
when its market share began to steadily decline. This was mainly the result of the ener-
getic efforts of other large investment banks—especially Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch,
First Boston, and Morgan Stanley—to capture part of the lucrative junk bond market.
Theyincreasedtheirjunkbondresourcesbyexpandingtheirtrading,research,andsales
staffs. The investment apparently paid off; by the late 1980s each of these banks had cap-
tured a significant part of the new public issue junk bond market. Drexel’s dominant role
in the junk bond market appeared to loosen in 1989 after Milken’s indictment. Some
firms, hesitant to do business with Drexel, turned to other underwriters. Drexel’s end
came ingloriously with its Chapter 11 filing in February 1990.
Investment Bankers and Highly Conﬁdent Letters
As the size and complexity of the financing packages associated with the deals of the
fourth merger wave increased, the need to demonstrate an ability to raise the requisite
capital became more important, particularly for bidders who were significantly smaller
than their targets. This process was facilitated by the use of a Highly Confident Letter, in
which the bidder’s investment bank states that, based on market conditions and its anal-
ysis of the deal, it is highly confident that it can raise the necessary capital to complete
the deal. This letter is often attached to tender offer filing documents.
The genesis of the Highly Confident Letter can be traced to Carl Icahn’s $4.5
billion bid for Phillips Petroleum in 1985. Icahn’s investment banker, Drexel Burnham
Lambert, issued a Highly Confident Letter in which it stated, “We are highly confident
we can arrange the financing.”5 The letter gave Icahn instant credibility and was a
major contributing factor in his success in selling the shares he had acquired back to
Phillips without testing the strength of Drexel’s letter. Thereafter, the Highly Confident
Letter became an important part of the takeover business.
Icahn later used the Highly Confident Letter as an essential part of his “takeover
toolkit.” Armed with the letter and the resulting increased credibility produced by this
investment banker’s ability to marshal the vast financial resources of the then-strong
junk bond market, Icahn had to be taken more seriously. Targets responded to threats
from hostile bidders armed with their letters with offers of greenmail.
Investment Banks and Liquidity of Junk Bond Investments
As noted previously, investment banks, led by the trailblazing role of Drexel Burnham
Lambert in the 1980s, served as a market maker for junk bonds. In doing so, they
became buyers when holders wanted to sell and sellers when investors wanted to buy.
This gave the market liquidity it otherwise would not have had. The enhanced liquidity

◾
High-Yield Financing and the Leveraged Loan Market
lowered the risk of these investments and made them more marketable. Another way
in which investment banks enhanced the liquidity of these investments was to work
with troubled issuers when they appeared to be in danger of defaulting. At one time,
Drexel prided itself that issues underwritten by Drexel did not default. Drexel would go
to great lengths to ensure that these troubled issuers would not be technically declared
in default. Sometimes the default might be prevented by the issuance of a new offering
that would be exchanged for the troubled outstanding issue. In cases of more serious
liquidity problems, very different types of bonds might be offered in exchange for the
bonds that investors were holding. Such bonds might not pay cash interest payments
for a period of time while the issuer took steps to improve its financial condition. One
version of such securities is PIK, or payment-in-kind securities. These bonds do not
make cash payments for an initial period, which might range from 3 to 10 years. These
bonds came under sharp criticism as the junk bond market began to falter in the late
1980s and investors were being presented with the alternative of exchanging their
interest-paying bonds that were about to default for other bonds that would not pay
cash interest payments for an extended period of time. Given the poor prospects that
security holders with an inferior position in the bankruptcy liquidation hierarchy have,
many bondholders reluctantly accepted the exchanges.
Junk Bond Reﬁnancing and Bridge Loans
When companies do a cash acquisition, they need the up-front capital to pay the target
company shareholders for their shares. They may plan on using high-yield bonds to
finance the deal, but the seller might not want to exchange its shares for the high-yield
bonds the buyer would issue. To solve this problem the buyer then can enlist the services
of its investment banker, who raises the short-term financing the buyer needs. This
financing can come in the form of a bridge loan from the bank. This loan can then be
“refinanced” at a later date through an issuance of high-yield bonds.
Collapse of the Junk Bond Market in the Late 1980s
In spite of its rapid growth in the mid-1980s, the junk bond market collapsed at the end
of that decade. Certain major events rocked the junk bond market in the 1980s. They
include the bankruptcy of the LTV Corporation and Integrated Resources, and the legal
problems of Michael Milken and his investment bank, Drexel Burnham Lambert. These
events are discussed in the following sections.
LTV Bankruptcy
The resiliency of the junk bond market was called into question in 1986, when the
LTV Corporation defaulted on the high-yield bonds it had issued. The LTV bankruptcy
was the largest corporate bankruptcy at that time and represented 56% of the total
debt defaulting in 1986.6 Ma, Rao, and Peterson showed that this event caused a

temporary six-month revision in the market’s probabilities for default, as reflected by
the risk-premium yields on junk bonds. This effect proved transitory, and the market
more than fully rebounded afterward. The Ma study indicates that the junk bond
market was at that time quite resilient and more than capable of withstanding the
shock of a major default.
Financing Failures of 1989
In addition to the bankruptcy of LTV, the junk market was jolted by other critical
events. While the LTV bankruptcy was not related to M&As, the failures of other
junk bond issuers were directly related to overpriced and overleveraged deals. Large
offerings by issuers, such as Campeau Corporation, swelled the market with increased
supply. In the first half of 1989, $20 billion worth of junk bonds was offered, compared
with $9.2 billion for the same period in 1988. Issuers had to offer higher and higher
rates to attract investors to buy the risky securities. Campeau Corporation’s offering
of junk bonds in 1988, led by the investment bank First Boston Corporation, was
poorly received, even though it provided 16% coupon payments on 12-year bonds and
17.75% coupons on 16-year bonds. In October 1988, First Boston had to withdraw
a $1.15 billion junk-bond offering, as investor demand for the debt-laden concern’s
securities failed to materialize. The investment bank responded with a $750-million
offering that provided higher yields. However, demand was very weak. For example,
junk bonds issued by Resorts International, Tracor, and Interco declined significantly
during this year. The lack of a strong, reliable secondary market made it even more
difficult to offer new high-yield bonds. This downturn was a contributing factor in the
unraveling of the financing for the buyout of United Airlines in October 1989. Even
when reputable issuers, such as Ohio Mattress—maker of Sealy and Stearns & Foster
mattresses—offered 15% interest rates for a proposed $475 million issue in 1989, the
market refused to respond. This event became known as the burning mattress.
Default of Integrated Resources
Integrated Resources, a company built on junk bonds and the most prominent buyer
of junk bonds among insurance companies, defaulted in June 1989 and filed for
bankruptcy in early 1990. This sent shockwaves through the ranks of institutional
investors who had helped fuel the growth of the junk bond market.
Bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert
In its heyday in 1986, Drexel reported pretax annual profits of $1 billion. Only two years
later, in late 1988, it pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid more than $40 million
in fines. In 1989, Drexel showed a loss of $40 million.
The immediate cause of Drexel’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing was a liquidity
crisis resulting from the firm’s inability to pay short-term loans and commercial paper
financing that came due. Securities firms generally rely on short-term capital to finance
their securities holdings. Drexel had been the issuer of more than $700 million in

376

commercial paper.7 When the commercial paper market contracted in 1989, Drexel
was forced to pay off more than $575 million, which could not be refinanced through
the issues of new commercial paper. Closing the commercial paper market effectively
wiped out Drexel’s liquidity. With the prior collapse of the junk bond market, Drexel
could not seek long-term financing as a substitute. The firm had no recourse but to file
for Chapter 11 protection.
Banking Regulation
The savings and loan difficulties of this period led to a regulatory backlash against those
institutions that invested heavily in junk bonds. Many of these institutions did so to avoid
the disintermediation that came from having to compete for deposits that were leaving
savings and loans (S&Ls) in favor of other higher-yielding investments. In order to be
able to pay higher rates to depositors, S&Ls often invested in high-yield bonds. When
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act was passed in 1989,
banks were forced to mark their junk bond holdings to market values. Many were forced
to sell off their junk bond investments into a market in which demand was weak and
supply was increasing. This further weakened the junk bond market.
Role of Junk Bond Research in the Growth of the Market
in the Fourth Wave
Various studies on junk bonds have been performed that seem to indicate these secu-
rities are not as risky as some investors perceive, and may provide returns in excess
of the risk they have. One such study was done by W. Braddock Hickman’s National
Bureau of Economic Research, which was published in 1958.8 One of Hickman’s
main conclusions was that noninvestment-grade bonds showed higher returns than
investment-grade bonds, even after taking into account default losses. The time period
of his study was from 1900 to 1943. These results were challenged by Fraine and
Mills, who pointed out that factors such as interest rate fluctuations may have biased
Hickman’s results.9 Although Hickman’s pro–junk bond results have been widely cited
by the securities industry, the contradictory findings of Fraine and Mills failed to receive
similar attention. Indeed, Michael Milken used Hickman’s findings to market high-yield
bonds to conservative institutional investors.
The existence of the Hickman research notwithstanding, high-yield bonds
remained a difficult sale until the late 1970s. Institutional investors were reluctant to
add to their portfolio securities that they considered unduly risky. This attitude started
to change with the publication of another major research study that seemed to lend
support to the Hickman findings. A study by Altman and Namacher seemed to provide

evidence that the default rates of low-rated firms were much lower than was believed.10
The Altman and Namacher study showed that the average default rate for junk bonds
was 2.1%, which was not significantly higher than the default rate on investment-grade
securities, which was almost 0%. The Altman and Namacher study revealed that as
the time of default approaches, the rating declines. They observed that 13 of 130 (10%)
were rated as investment-grade one year before default, whereas only 4 out of 130 (3%)
received such a rating six months before default.11 This implies that the bond rating
can be used as a reliable indicator of the likelihood of default.
The Altman and Namacher study had been one of the dominant pieces of research
on the default risk of junk bonds. Their results and those of other studies of that era
implied that the marketplace is inefficient and pays a return in excess of the risk on these
securities.12 However, the results were affected by the fact that Altman’s default mea-
sure, the dollar value of bonds in default divided by the total dollar value of high-yield
bonds in the market, was very much affected by the rapid growth of this market in the
mid-1980s, which to some extent masked the default rate. Risky bonds might not man-
ifest this risk until they have “aged” for a period of time. The Altman and Namacher
study did not follow the bonds over their life to see how their risk profile changed as the
bonds aged.
A study by Asquith, Mullins, and Wolff considered the aging effect of junk bonds.13
He and his co-researchers followed the junk bonds that were issued in 1977 and 1978
until 1986. In doing so, they offset the impact of the rapidly growing junk bond market
that affected the Altman and Namacher results. Their study also commented on the
role that exchanges played in understating the true junk bond default rate. When junk
bond issuers were in danger of defaulting, investment banks such as Drexel Burnham
Lambert sometimes would offer bondholders an exchange of new bonds that might
not pay interest right away but that might offer higher interest in the future. Other
exchanges involved non-dividend-paying (at least not paying dividends at that time)
stock. Bondholders often reluctantly accepted such exchanges, as the alternative of
default was less attractive.
The Asquith study also considered the adverse impact that the call-in of bonds had.
Many firms that issued junk bonds with relatively higher interest rates took advantage of
the decline in interest rates after they were issued. Many junk bonds have call protection
for a limited period of time; during that period the bonds may not be called in. At the end
of that period, the bonds may be called in, as a result of which the bondholders may be
deprived of a rate of return superior to other rates available in the market. Asquith and
his co-researchers reported that 23% to 43% of the bonds issued from 1977 to 1982
were called by November 1, 1988. These calls were a result of the decline in interest
rates that started in 1982.

The Asquith study defined defaults to be either a declaration of default by the bond
trustee, a bankruptcy filing by the issuer, or the assignment of a D rating by Standard &
Poor’s. If the bonds were exchanged for other securities that eventually defaulted, this
was also considered a default of the original issue. This study showed that, as expected,
default rates were higher for “older” issues. For example, bonds issued in 1977 had a
cumulative default rate of 33.92%, whereas bonds issued in 1978 had a cumulative
default rate equal to 34.26% (Table 10.1).
Junk Bond Defaults and Aging
The Asquith study also measured the relationship between defaults and aging. As noted,
it showed that default rates were low in the early years after the issuance of a junk bond.
It found, for example, that for 7 of the 10 issue years covered by their study, there were
no defaults in the first year. Seven years after issue, however, defaults rose to between
17% and 26%. By years 11 and 12, the default rates increased to greater than one-third
for the two relevant issue years, 1977 and 1978. Altman, however, disputes the rela-
tionship between aging and defaults and fails to find a discernible pattern that would
support this relationship.14
The Asquith study raises serious questions regarding the riskiness of junk bonds.
It contradicts the Altman and Namacher findings, which downplay the riskiness of
junk bonds. However, later research by Altman supports the aging factor. For example,
Altman and Kishore show that low-rated bonds are less likely to default in the first year
of their life, but that this probability rises significantly by the third year.15
Changing Role of Junk Bond Financing in Takeovers
and Corporate Finance
The growth of the junk bond market in the 1980s added a highly combustible fuel
to the fires of the fourth merger wave. As described previously, one of the first hostile

History of the Junk Bond Market

takeover attempts financed by junk bonds was the attempted bid for Gulf Oil Co. by
the celebrated raider T. Boone Pickens. Pickens was president of a relatively small
company, Mesa Petroleum. A small oil company by Seven Sisters standards, Mesa was
not a serious threat. When Pickens arranged a $2 billion commitment from Drexel
Burnham Lambert, as set forth in a Highly Confident Letter, the smaller oil company
gained instant credibility. The monies were ultimately to be raised by an offering of junk
bonds. The access to such large amounts of financing instantly made Mesa a credible
threat. Gulf took the offer seriously and finally agreed to be bought out by a white
knight—Chevron. This $13.3 billion deal was the largest U.S. merger at that time, and
it enabled Chevron/Gulf to become the largest U.S. refiner. In 2001, Chevron would
merge with Texaco, forming one of the largest oil companies in the world.
Junk bond financing was particularly important for bidders that lacked the internal
capital and access to traditional financing sources, such as bank loans. The use of junk
bond financing to finance acquisitions grew dramatically in 1988 but then collapsed in
the years that followed.
The collapse of the junk bond market in the late 1980s contributed to the end of
the fourth merger wave. There were other major factors, such as the slowdown of the
economy, along with the overall decline of the stock market. Many of the companies
that utilized high-yield bonds to finance highly leveraged takeovers ended up defaulting
in the 1990s. When the economy began to recover in the early 1990s and companies
began to again consider the benefits of rapid growth that M&As provide, many vowed
they would never overleverage themselves. Many companies initially indicated that
deals have a sound financial structure with more equity and less reliance on debt.
Therefore, when the fifth merger wave ensued, high-yield bonds played a much less
significant role.
Following the fourth merger wave the M&A market relied much less on junk bond
financing. However, the original issue high-yield bond market became a permanent part
of the world of corporate finance. Companies that had been shut out of the bond market
could now offer a higher yield and access the bond market. In addition, bank lending
became more flexible as private equity buyers helped fuel the demand for loans by banks
to borrowers, which would be much more heavily levered customers than what banks
would normally lend to. Thus, the leveraged loan market became another financing
alternative for acquirers to consider.
Junk Bond Financing of M&As in the 2000s
Junk bonds remain an important source of financing for M&As. They are used
in conjunction with other sources of debt financing, including leveraged loans.
The demand for junk bond financing varies as a function of market forces, including
the strength of the M&A market, as well as the risk preferences of investors. Being
a more high-risk security, investors may shy away from this area of finance when
market conditions and the economy weakens and investors become more risk adverse.
However, when rates decline, as they did in the wake of the subprime crisis when central
banks engaged in expansionary monetary policy which drove down rates, investors

380
◾
High-Yield Financing and the Leveraged Loan Market
may chase yields and move more capital into the junk bond market. Such conditions
can make implementing junk bond financing of M&As easier to complete as the demand
for these bonds may be higher.
LEVERAGED LOAN MARKET
One of the reasons why the original issue junk bond market grew was that there was
a demand for an alternative to bank loans. It is ironic, therefore, that in the 2000s
leveraged loans have often replaced junk bond financing as the preferred debt financing
source used to complete deals.
Leveraged loans are loans to speculative-grade borrowers. These are usually borrow-
ers who already have a significant amount of debt or who are now taking on a high
amount of debt relative to equity capital. These loans are usually syndicated loans that
are loans with a single set of terms but that have multiple lenders with each supply part
of the overall debt capital.
Loans can be characterized as leveraged loans due to their higher rate, such as
LIBOR + 150 basis points. They also can be rated, and the rating system is similar to
that of junk bonds, with leveraged loans having a rating of BB or lower being considered
part of the leveraged loan market.
This market is not a new one but has existed for some time (see Figure 10.2). How-
ever, like many financial markets it has evolved over time. The market tends to decline
when the economy slows and enters a recession. However, Figure 10.2 shows that, with
the exception of those recessionary periods, the market has grown impressively.
As Figure 10.3 shows, the M&A-related leveraged loan market grew exponentially
in the sixth merger wave, particularly based on demand from private equity buyers.
However, the market collapsed after the subprime crisis and the related default of
Lehman Brothers. As the M&A market recovered and grew in the years that followed,
so, too, did the leveraged loan market.

Leveraged loans have certain advantages over junk bonds for acquirers. Junk bonds
are public market securities and bring with them all the drawbacks that an issuance of
public market bonds has. In addition, as we will discuss ahead, leverage loans may be
somewhat less risky for investors compared to junk bonds.
One major difference between the leveraged loan market that now exists compared
with the past is that there are now more sources of lending, such as hedge funds. These
funds provide financing for loans such as second-lien debt. This debt is senior debt that
has a secondary claim on assets after debt that is held by banks.
Commercial banks may assume loans with the knowledge that they can syndicate
the debt to hedge funds. These loans may have a higher claim on the assets of the
ultimate borrower and thus offer a lower rate relative to junk bonds, which is attractive
to borrowers. Because this market grew significantly in the mid-2000s, there is an
abundant supply of capital that commercial banks know they can tap into to offload
the risks of these loans. The availability of this capital makes the loans relatively liquid,
which encourages banks to lend. In turn, this has caused this supply of debt financing
to grow—and often surpass—junk bonds as the preferred debt financing source.
M&As and LBOs constitute a very significant percentage of the overall leveraged
loan market. This percentage, however, varies with the volume of deals.
Default, Recovery, and Loss Rates: Leveraged Loans
versus Junk Bonds
Both junk bonds and leveraged loans have comparable default rates. As would be
expected, these default rates are very sensitive to economic conditions. The leveraged
loan default rate was less than 1% in 2007 but rose to greater than 10% by 2009.
The default rate steadily declined after 2009, and by 2011–2012, it was similar to
presubprime crisis levels (see Figure 10.4).
While the default rate of junk bonds and leveraged loans is somewhat similar, the
recovery rate can be greater for leveraged loans. This lowers the risk of leveraged loans,
giving them an advantage over junk bonds.

Expansion of Banks Originating Leveraged Loans
Commercial banks have discovered that by syndicating leveraged loans to buyers of debt,
suchashedgefunds,theycanquicklytakethedebtofftheirbalancesheetwhileoriginat-
ing the loans and generating good income from this service. In the early 2000s, in the
United States only a few large commercial banks accounted for the bulk of the leveraged
loan business. These included banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo. How-
ever, the rest of the banking industry has responded to the profits with measured risks
that are available in this business. This came at a time when hedge funds were eager to
participate in this lending. As a result, the number of large commercial bank lenders in
this area of finance has significantly increased.
Dealmakers in the mid-2000s noticed that they could not always count on a
positive reception from the high-yield bond market, whereas the response was often
more favorable in the leveraged loan market. In addition, in the mid-2000s, the junk

Stapled Financing
◾
383
bond market might ask rates in the 12% to 14% range, while the leveraged loan market
might quote a rate that is in the range of 200 to 300 basis points above LIBOR. However,
when markets perceive higher risk levels, such as when the subprime crisis took hold,
rates can rise sharply. It is ironic that when overall rates fell in response to the Federal
Reserve’s expansionary monetary policy in 2008–2009, risk premiums on leveraged
loans rose. More importantly, however, many lenders withdrew from the market
and were reluctant to make these loans even when the rate included a significant
risk premium.
In 1999, regulations that previously limited the ability of banks to underwrite
securities were relaxed. This allowed commercial banks to enter underwriting markets,
such as the junk bond business. Once given the opportunity to enter this arena,
commercial banks moved in aggressively and grabbed market share. However, in recent
years investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have moved
aggressively in this market. As of 2017 they are the leaders followed by Barclays and
Credit Suisse.
Recent Trends in Regulation of the Leveraged Loan Market
In the wake of the subprime crisis, the Federal Reserve had been concerned about the
leveraged loan market. Deal volume slowed dramatically during the Great Recession,
and this was less of a concern. However, deal volume began to pick up in the years
that followed and with it a more aggressive expansion of the leveraged loan market. In
2013, the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency issued guidance that
sought to deter the financing of very highly leveraged deals. The regulator’s reasoning
is that if the economy faltered, highly leveraged companies would be extra-vulnerable
to failure.
The guidance indicated that banks should avoid funding deals that leave the compa-
nies with debt more than six times EBITDA. The guidance also discouraged repayment
time periods that were excessively long.
STAPLED FINANCING
Another innovation in the M&A market is the use by buyers of stapled financing. This is a
topic worth covering, even though it is not exclusive to high-yield financing or leveraged
loans.
When a buyer is considering a purchase of a target, one element of uncertainty is
the financing that will be needed to complete the deal. Such uncertainty could cause a
buyer to pass on a given transaction. In order to maximize the chances of a favorable
bid, the investment banks of some targets sometimes offer prearranged financing with
specific agreed-on terms. Stapled financing is a prearranged financing package made
available to bidders by the target’s financing advisor.

384
◾
High-Yield Financing and the Leveraged Loan Market
Stapled financing became popular during and right after the 2001 recession that
followed the downturn in securities markets. The economic contraction made access to
capital markets more problematic and helped cool off deal volume. Investment banks,
seeking to make deals easier for sellers and buyers, began to prearrange the financing
that would be necessary to purchase the target. This became an additional service that
they offered that enhanced the total fees they realized from deals. While stapled financ-
ing was an innovation brought about to deal with weakness in capital markets, it has
grown significantly as the markets improved in the 2000s.
Morgan Stanley claims that it is the first investment bank to provide such a
complete package. One of the first deals in which Morgan Stanley used these financing
packages involved the auction of Dresser Industries, which was a unit of Halliburton Co.
Dresser makes engineering equipment used in the petroleum industry. Morgan Stanley
got together with CSFB and was able to arrange the sale of the unit to two private equity
buyers, First Reserve Corp. and Odyssey Investment Partners LLC, for $1.3 billion.16
Of this total, $820 million came from a loan package that the two investment banks
arranged in advance.
Stapled financing can help facilitate an auction, which tends to result in greater sale
prices. By making the financing easier, a potentially greater number of buyers may pur-
sue a given deal. For this reason it may be advantageous for sellers to utilize the services
of investment bankers and advisors that also have a strong financing capability.
The terms of the stapled financing package may not always be the best for the
buyer. The investment banks offering the stapled financing are making the deal easier
to finance and seek a fee for this service. However, shrewd buyers, such as private equity
firms that normally have good access to other financing providers, can “shop the loan”
to other banks so that they assure themselves they are getting the best terms.
As with other areas of M&A, stapled financing is not without its potential conflicts.
Seeking the returns from financing, investment banks may have an incentive to push
deals through that may not be in the seller’s interests. Sellers need to be aware of their
own value so that they do the deal that is in the best interests of their shareholders.
Admittedly, they utilize the services of an investment advisor to help them with this pro-
cess. However, when that advisor is also the stapled financing provider, the seller has to
be mindful of the advisor’s other interests.
Stapled Financing Potential Conﬂicts: Del Monte Decision
The potential conflicts involved with stapled financing got significant attention in the
Del Monte shareholder lawsuit in which the Delaware Chancery Court issued a prelimi-
nary injunction enjoining a shareholder vote on a proposed 2010 $5.3 billion leveraged
buyout of the company by a consortium of three private equity buyers.17 The court was
concerned that the board was not sufficiently active in the sales process and perhaps the
sell-side financial advisor had too much incentive to see the deal with the private equity
advisor go through so as to reap the financial rewards from the financing fees. In fact,
16 Vyvyan Tenorio, “A Permanent Staple? Stapled Financing,” The Deal (May 1–7, 2006): 36.

thecourt stated that the seller’sfinancial advisorhad “secretly and selfishly manipulated
the sale process to engineer a transaction that would permit Barclays to obtain lucrative
buy-side financing fees.” The court also prevented the enforcement of no-shop provi-
sions and termination fees, which could impede a true auction. The lawsuit was settled
in October 2011, with Barclays Capital agreeing to pay $89 million.18
In spite of concern about conflicts, having a stapled financing commitment in place
can greatly reduce the financing-related uncertainties for both buyers and sellers, but it
is not foolproof. If markets suddenly shift, such as when the subprime crisis took hold,
lenders may simply choose not to honor the agreement or provide the financing. Buyers
and sellers are then left to resort to litigation to try to remedy the situation. This is a
time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain route to take.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
Corporate Restructuring
A
LTHOUGH THE FIELD OF mergers and acquisitions (M&As) tends to focus
on corporate expansion, companies often have to contract and downsize
their operations. This need may arise because a division of the company is
performing poorly or simply because it no longer fits into the firm’s plans. Restructuring
may also be necessary to undo a previous merger or acquisition that was unsuccessful.
While we see that many sell-offs are motivated by financial pressures brought on by a
combination of high leverage and weak economic demand, we also see that the volume
of sell-offs increases when overall deal volume increases. As such, sell-off deal volume
tends to follow the ups and down of the economy, just like M&As follow the overall
pattern of economic fluctuations. This is the case not only in the United States but also
in Asia and Europe.
In this chapter, the different types of corporate contraction are considered, and a
decision-making methodology for reaching the divestiture decision is developed. The
methods used to value acquisition targets are also used by companies to determine
whether a particular component of the firm is worth retaining. Both the divesting and
the acquiring firms commonly go through a similar type of analysis as they view the
transaction from opposite sides. Even though the methods are similar, the two parties
may come up with different values because they use different assumptions or have
different needs.
This chapter considers the shareholder wealth effects of several forms of corporate
restructuring. Corporate contraction may have positive stock price effects when the
divested component fails to yield a value to the corporation that is commensurate with
its market value. In such instances the corporation may be able to enhance the value of
shareholder investments by pursuing a policy of corporate restructuring.

◾
Corporate Restructuring
Corporate restructuring can take several different forms: divestitures, equity
carve-outs, spinoffs, split-offs, exchange offer, and split-ups. A divestiture is a sale
of a portion of the firm to an outside party. The selling firm is usually paid in cash,
marketable securities, or a combination of the two. An equity carve-out is a variation
of a divestiture that involves the sale of an equity interest in a subsidiary to outsiders.
The sale may not necessarily leave the parent company in control of the subsidiary.
The new equity gives the investors shares of ownership in the portion of the selling
company that is being divested. In an equity carve-out, a new legal entity is created
with a stockholder base that may be different from that of the parent selling company.
The divested company has a different management team and is run as a separate firm.
A new legal entity is also created in a standard spinoff. Once again, new shares are
issued, but here they are distributed to stockholders on a pro rata basis. As a result of the
proportional distribution of shares, the stockholder base in the new company is the same
as that of the old company. Although the stockholders are initially the same, the spun-off
firm has its own management and is run as a separate company. Another difference
between a spinoff and a divestiture is that a divestiture involves an infusion of funds into
the parent corporation, whereas a spinoff normally does not provide the parent with a
cash infusion.
In an exchange offer, also called a split-off, new shares in a subsidiary are issued
and shareholders in the parent company are given the option to either hold on to their
shares or exchange these shares for an equity interest in the new publicly held sub-
sidiary. This type of transaction is somewhat similar to a spinoff in that new shares are
issued that represent an equity interest in a subsidiary that is separated from the parent.
Itisdifferentfromaspinoff,however,inthatinorderthegetthenewlyissuedshares,par-
ent company shareholders have to part with their shares. For example, in 2013, Pfizer
offered its shareholders the opportunity to exchange their shares for the shares of its
spun-off animal health subsidiary, Zoetis. Shareholders were offered $107.52 worth of
Zoetis shares for each $100 of Pfizer shares. The additional $7.52 in Zoetis shares gave
themanincentivetoexchange.Whiletheparentcompanylosesthecontributiontoprof-
itsoftheentitythatisseparatedfromtheparentcompany,totalsharesoutstandingofthe
parent company are reduced, which may offset the losses of profits in earnings per share.
In a split-up, the entire firm is broken up into a series of spinoffs. The end result of
this process is that the parent company no longer exists, leaving only the newly formed
companies. The stockholders in the companies may be different because stockholders
exchange their shares in the parent company for shares in one or more of the units that
are spun off.
Sometimes companies do a combination of more than one of these methods of sepa-
ration. For example, in February 1999, General Motors (GM) did an equity carve-out of
just over 17% of its auto products subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems. Three months
later, the remainder of the company was spun off, with GM shareholders receiving 0.7
shares of Delphi for each share of GM that they owned. With these transactions GM
believed it was exiting the auto parts business. However, the labor agreements GM had
with the United Auto Workers left GM with some responsibility for the burdensome wage

and benefit payments to Delphi workers. This was problematic when Delphi was forced
to file for bankruptcy in 2005.
RJR NABISCO RESTRUCTURING
R
JR Nabisco announced in 1999 that it was engaging in a dramatic restructuring
that would involve divestitures and spinoffs. The parent company, RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp., decided to sell R. J. Reynolds International to Japan Tobacco for
almost $8 billion. The tobacco business, long known for impressive cash ﬂows,
was already run as separate domestic and international entities. R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco, the domestic unit, was then spun off. Part of the reason for the deal was
the problems that the domestic tobacco unit had as it faced an ongoing onslaught
of litigation in the United States. In addition, the unit was losing market share to a
stronger rival—Philip Morris. In terms of total cigarettes consumed, the U.S. tobacco
market was, and continues to be, a declining market. In addition, at that time R. J.
Reynolds was losing market share in that market that was itself shrinking. In addition,
although the tobacco business generates steady cash ﬂow, the litigation liabilities
loomed large over the company. The international tobacco unit showed more
promise, but this promise would have been difﬁcult to realize with the international
business tied to the U.S. unit. As part of the restructuring plan, 80% of the food
business, Nabisco Holdings Corp., would be owned by Nabisco Group Holdings.
The food business was improving, and the company was hoping that the increased
focus brought about by the restructuring would enable the company to capitalize
on the momentum it was establishing in improving the food business.
Following the restructuring, the stock price of the independent R. J. Reynolds
tobacco unit faltered, only to rebound in 2000. The declines in market share began
to stabilize at the 24% level, but then deteriorated again due to aggressive discoun-
ters, especially those that were not affected by the Master Settlement Agreements,
which impose huge cash ﬂow penalties on the four major U.S. cigarette manufac-
turers as a result of their legal settlement with the states.
In 2004, R. J. Reynolds, the number-two U.S. cigarette manufacturer, merged
with Brown and Williamson, the then number-three-ranked company in the industry.
The combined company is now called Reynolds American. The fact that this merger
was unopposed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) underscores the weakness
of these two ﬁrms. The merger of these two companies, both of which have similar
problems in the form of a high volume of litigation and erosion of market share from
aggressive discounters, allowed R. J. Reynolds to expand its position in the tobacco
business at a time when the sale of its food business to Kraft allowed it to be more
focused, while allowing Kraft to become even more of a major presence in the
international food business. In 2014, Reynolds approached number three–ranked
Lorrilard with a merger proposal. In 2015, Reynolds was able to complete the
acquisition of this company that featured the major brand Newport. Given that this
deal marked a consolidation of the U.S. tobacco industry, the antitrust approval
process took a year and was only completed after the sale of certain brands.
In the late 1990s, it appeared that the onslaught of litigation liabilities would kill
the industry. The huge industry payments imposed by a settlement the tobacco com-
panies made in 1998 with 47 state attorneys generals had an estimated $208 billion

in payments over the next 25 years. In reality, the tobacco manufacturers were able
to pass along signiﬁcant price increases to their consumers due to the relatively
inelastic demand for the product.a This allowed U.S. tobacco companies to thrive
as reﬂected by the impressive performance of the S&P tobacco index (Figure A).

The tobacco industry, and companies such as BAT, have branched out in recent
years and have taken advantage of the rising popularity of nontraditional products
such as e-cigarettes and vaping products. In addition, in 2017 British American
Tobacco acquired Reynolds American in a $49 billion deal. The industry has consol-
idated and thrived—something that was difﬁcult to envision in the late 1990s.

informed consumers who trade off enjoyment (presumably) they receive from consumption
of the product and the potential health ramiﬁcations that some (but far from all) incur.
DIVESTITURES
Most sell-offs are simple divestitures. Companies pursue other forms of sell-offs, such as
a spinoff or an equity carve-out, to achieve other objectives in addition to getting rid of
a particular division. These objectives may be to make the transaction tax-free, which
may call for a spinoff.
The most common form of divestiture involves the sale of a division of the parent
company to another firm. The process is a form of contraction for the selling company
but a means of expansion for the purchasing corporation.

Historical Trends
In the late 1960s, during the third merger wave, the number of divestitures and selloffs
was relatively small as a percentage of the total number of transactions. Companies
were engaging in major expansions at this time, widely using the acquisition of other
firms to increase the acquiring company’s stock price. This expansion came to an abrupt
end following changes in the tax laws and other regulatory measures, along with the
stock market decline. Companies then began to reconsider some of the acquisitions that
had proven to be poor combinations—a need intensified by the 1974–1975 recession.
Under the pressure of weaker economic demand, firms were forced to sell off divisions
to raise funds and improve cash flow. International competition also pressured some of
the 1960s conglomerates to become more efficient by selling off prior acquisitions that
were not competitive in a world market.
This reversal of the acquisition trend was visible as early as 1971, when divestitures
jumped to 42% of total transactions. The trend peaked in 1975, a period of economic
recession, when the number of divestitures constituted 54% of all transactions. They
remained between 35% and 40% throughout the 1980s. In the fifth merger wave,
however, the number of divestitures rose again as downsizing and refocusing became
prominent business strategies. When overall deal volume weakened at the end of that
wave, divestiture volume also slowed, only to rebound again in the 2000s, when M&A
activity resumed.
Many divestitures are the result of sell-offs of previous acquisitions. The relation-
ship between acquisitions and subsequent divestitures is shown in Figure 11.1. The
belief that many divestitures are the undoing of previous acquisitions is seen in the
leading trend in the acquisitions curve relative to the divestiture curve. The intense
period of merger activity of the late 1960s is reflected in a pronounced peak at this
time, followed by a peak in the divestiture curve in the early 1970s. The stock market

performance seemed to play a determining role in the volume of divestitures. Linn
and Rozeff used regression analysis to show that in years when the stock market fell,
such as 1966, 1969, and 1973–1974, the rate of divestiture fell below what one
would have predicted given the previous merger rates. When the market performed
well (periods that usually correspond to when the economy is doing well), the num-
ber of divestitures increased.1 This research is also consistent with the rising stock
market and increased number of divestitures of the 1990s. Figure 11.1 shows that
when M&A activity slowed in the late 1980s, the pace of spinoffs and divestitures
increased. However, as the fifth merger wave accelerated in the 1990s, the number
of sell-offs continued to increase, although as a percentage of total transactions
they declined.
Many critics of some corporate acquisitions use the record of the divestitures follow-
ing poor acquisitions as evidence of ill-conceived expansion planning. These criticisms,
whichwehearoftentoday,havebeenvoicedformanyyears.Forexample,usingasample
of 33 companies during the period 1950–1986, Porter showed that these firms divested
53% of the acquisitions that brought the acquiring companies into new industries.2
Based on this evidence, he concluded that the corporate acquisition record is “dismal.”
These results were somewhat supported by Ravenscraft and Scherer, who found that
33% of acquisitions made during the 1960s and 1970s were later divested.3 The track
record of many more recent acquisitions also leaves something to be desired.4
Global Divestiture Trends
There is a strong similarity among the variations in the volume of divestitures in the
United States, Europe, and Asia. However, the value of total divestitures in Europe and
Asia rose more sharply in the second half of the fifth merger wave than they did in the
United States. All three series declined when the economy turned down in 2000–2001;
however, they began to increase again in 2003—especially in Europe (see Figure 11.2a,
b, and c). As of the end of 2008, the total value of divestitures in Europe was somewhat
greater than in the United States while deal total and average deal value in Asia was
much lower. Deal volume in all three regions fell in 2008 as a result of the fallout from
the subprime crisis, which made financing for acquisitions of divested assets more dif-
ficult to access. Also, most companies were not looking to expand during this period
by acquiring units of other companies, as such companies were more often than not
in retrenchment mode. As with M&A volume, when the economic recovery picked up
steam divestitures did so as well although total volume slowed after 2014.

Corporate Restructuring
Divestiture Likelihood and Prior Acquisitions
Kaplan and Weisbach analyzed 271 large acquisitions completed between 1971
and 1982.5 A total of 43.9%, or 119, of these acquisitions were divested by 1982.
The divested entities were held for an average of seven years. Kaplan and Weisbach
investigated the pattern of the divestitures in a search for a common motive for some
of the sell-offs. They found that diversifying acquisitions are four times more likely
to be divested than nondiversifying acquisitions. This result supports other evidence,
discussed in Chapter 4, that questions the benefits of acquisition programs. The
motives for divestitures, which are discussed in subsequent sections, are summarized in
Table 11.1.
Involuntary versus Voluntary Divestitures
A divestiture may be either voluntary or involuntary. An involuntary divestiture may
occur when a company receives an unfavorable review by the Justice Department or
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), requiring the company to divest itself of a par-
ticular division. For example, in June 1987, in a 4-to-1 vote, the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC) ruled that the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railway
systems might reduce competition. Santa Fe had merged with Southern Pacific in 1983
in one of the biggest mergers in railway history. The combined railway was operated
together while awaiting an antitrust analysis and ruling from the ICC, which had
antitrust jurisdiction for this type of merger. After the ruling, the ICC required Santa
Fe–Southern Pacific to submit a divestiture plan within 90 days. The adverse ruling had
a depressing effect on Santa Fe’s stock price and made the firm a target of a bid by the
Henley Group.

Reasons for Voluntary Divestitures
Poor Strategic Fit of Division
Voluntary divestitures are more common than involuntary divestitures and are
motivated by a variety of reasons. For example, the parent company may want to move
out of a particular line of business that it feels no longer fits into its overall strategic
plans. This decision can be difficult if the unit is generating good financial performance.
However, if a company maps out a clear overall strategic direction in which it wants
to move and if a unit does not mesh well with those plans, a divestiture may make
good sense. If the unit has been performing well, it may generate significant divestiture
proceeds that the company can invest in pursuing its overall strategic goals.
Reverse Synergy
One motive that is often ascribed to M&As is synergy. As described in Chapter 4, synergy
refers to the additional gains that may be derived when two forms combine. When
synergy exists, the combined entity is worth more than the sum of the parts valued
separately. In other words, 2 + 2 = 5. Reverse synergy means that the parts are worth
more separately than they are within the parent company’s corporate structure. In
other words, 4 −1 = 5. In such cases, an outside bidder might be able to pay more for
a division than what the division is worth to the parent company. For instance, a large
parent company is not able to operate a division profitably, whereas a smaller firm, or
even the division by itself, might operate more efficiently and therefore earn a higher
rate of return.
REFOCUSING THROUGH SALES OF COMPONENTS
OF PRIOR ACQUISITIONS—THE CASE OF
TAITTINGER
W
hen a company acquires a diversiﬁed target, it is often the case that it has
some business units that are more appealing than others. This was the case
in 2005, when Starwood Capital Group, a real estate company, acquired Taittinger
for $3.45 billion. Taittinger is the sixth-largest champagne company in that industry.
Starwood is known for its diverse hotel properties in an industry that it knows well.
However, Taittinger, through its Concorde Group, owned approximately 70 upscale
hotels in Europe, such as the Hotel de Crillon in Paris and Hotel Lutetia, as well as the
second-largest budget hotel chain on the continent—the Envergure Group. These
assets were the main appeal of Taittinger to Starwood. In addition to champagne
and hotels, Taittinger also owned the famous Baccarat crystal brand. Like a number
of other diversiﬁed European companies, such as LVMH, the combinations within the
corporate entity are only loosely related. This makes them more easily separable.
The Greenwich-based Starwood is run by Barry S. Sternlicht, a shrewd real
estate investor/hotel operator. He founded Starwood in 1995, and in a few years he
(continued )

398
◾
Corporate Restructuring
(continued )
acquired the Westin hotel chain along with ITT (what was left of that conglomerate),
which owned the Sheraton and St. Regis chains. He acquired Taittinger knowing
that he would be acquiring real estate assets that he felt were quite valuable. He
also knew that while he did not want his company in the champagne or crystal
business, the brands he was acquiring would command a good value in the market
as they were among the leaders in their respective ﬁelds. Taittinger, the third oldest
champagne house, was founded in 1734, and since 1931 has been controlled by the
Taittinger family. This is another example of large European corporations controlled
by family interests.
In 2016 Starwood sold out to Marriott International in a $12.2 billion deal. This
combination formed the world’s largest hotel company.
A good example of reverse synergy occurred in the late 1980s when the Allegis
Corporation was forced to sell off its previously acquired companies, Hertz Rent A Car
and the Weston and Hilton International hotel chains. Allegis had paid a high price
for these acquisitions based on the belief that the synergistic benefits of combining the
travel industry companies with United Airlines, its main asset, would more than justify
the high prices. When the synergistic benefits failed to materialize, the stock price fell,
setting the stage for a hostile bid from the New York investment firm Coniston Partners.
Coniston made a bid based on its analysis that the separate parts of Allegis were worth
more than the combined entity.
Poor Performance
Companies may want to divest divisions simply because they are not sufficiently prof-
itable. A nonprofitable unit may be diluting the performance of the overall company.
Such poorly performing divisions can be a financial drain on the overall company. The
performance may be judged by an inability to pay a rate of return that exceeds the par-
ent company’s hurdle rate—the minimum return threshold that a company will use to
evaluate projects or the performance of parts of the overall company. A typical hurdle
rate could be the firm’s cost of capital.
An example of this occurred in 2014, when Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest
maker of consumer products, announced that it would initiate a program to sell off
up to 100 of its brands. This would leave the company with approximately 70 to 80
brands. These 70 to 80 brands generate about 95% of the company’s profitability. The
company had been under pressure from activist William Ackman, who contended that
the Cincinnati-based company, founded by William Procter and James Gamble in 1837,
badly needed to cut costs and get rid of weaker-performing brands. The company had
been built up into an international consumer products colossus through both organic
growth as well as significant acquisitions, such as the 1957 acquisition of the Charmin
Paper Mills. In the 1990s, it acquired MaxFactor and Old Spice. In 2001, it acquired
Clairol from Bristol Myers Squibb, and in 2005, it acquired Gillette. The problem the
company had is that it had too many brands that did not generate financial results in

Divestitures

line with market expectations. Thus, the company needed to slim down and increase
its focus.
Capital Market Factors
A divestiture may also take place because the postdivestiture firm, as well as the divested
division, has greater access to capital markets. The combined corporate structure may
be more difficult for investors to categorize. Certain providers of capital might be looking
to invest in steel companies but not in pharmaceutical firms. Other investors might seek
to invest capital in pharmaceutical companies but may think that the steel industry
is too cyclical and has low growth potential. These two groups of investors might not
want to invest in a combined steel and pharmaceutical company, but each group might
separately invest in a stand-alone steel or pharmaceutical firm. Divestitures might
provide greater access to capital markets for the two firms as separate companies than
as a combined corporation.
ALTRIA’S SALE OF MILLER BREWING
A
ltria is the former Philip Morris. For many years, the company operated in three
main areas: tobacco, food, and beer (it had a small presence in the ﬁnance
business). Philip Morris is the leading cigarette company in the world and had
a U.S. market share in the 50% range. Its brand Marlboro is one of the leading
brand names in the world. Philip Morris’s tobacco business is divided into two parts:
Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International. The U.S. business is distinctly
different from its international business. First, the U.S. business has been the target
of over a thousand lawsuits. Second, U.S. tobacco consumption, on a unit basis,
has declined at approximately a 2% annual rate for many years. However, the
international tobacco business has been quite robust.
While Miller was the second-largest U.S. brewer, it lagged behind the Budweiser
and Busch brands of market leader Anheuser-Busch. The beer business in the United
States is highly competitive and requires major marketing expenditures to build
and expand a brand. Despite their best efforts, Miller failed to make the desired
contribution to company proﬁts to warrant Altria staying in this business. In July
2002, the company decided to sell Miller to South African Brewers (SAB) in a deal
that valued the company at $5.5 billion. SAB assumed $2 billion of Miller’s debt
while issuing shares to Philip Morris, which would own a little over a third of the
combined SAB/Miller.
SAB was, at the time of the Miller acquisition, the fourth-largest brewer in the
world. The deal vaulted SAB into the number-two position in the international beer
market. We have seen in Chapter 4 that the number-one and number-two positions
often confer advantages that smaller rivals have difﬁculty matching. In addition, SAB,
which also marketed Pilsner Urquell, now had a major brand in the U.S. market. SAB
also planned to use its international clout to help advance the Miller brand in and
outside of the United States. This deal was part of SAB’s growth through acquisition

(continued )
strategy in which the company expanded into a variety of markets in Eastern Europe
and Asia. It also acquired a major international brand in the Italian Peroni Group.
In the years following the Miller transaction, the global beer industry consol-
idated. SAB kept pace with this process by acquiring brewers in Australia, China,
and India, as well as in South America and Poland. In 2007, it entered a joint ven-
ture with Coors to combine the two companies’ U.S. operations. InBev, the global
industry leader, responded in 2008 by acquiring the largest American beer company,
Anheuser-Busch, for $52 billion. In 2016, InBev then did another blockbuster deal
when it acquired SAB Miller in a transaction that was valued in excess of $100 billion!
Similarly, divestitures may create companies in which investors would like to invest
but that do not exist in the marketplace. Such companies are sometimes referred to as
pure plays. Many analysts argue that the market is incomplete and that there is a demand
for certain types of firms that is not matched by a supply of securities in the market.
The sale of those parts of the parent company that become pure plays helps complete
the market.
The separation of divisions facilitates clearer identification and market segmenta-
tion for the investment community. For corporate divisions that need capital to grow, the
ability to attract new investment funds may be enhanced if the company is an indepen-
dent entity. Here, investors contemplating putting funds into a company can more easily
project the future returns when the business is a defined and separate unit as opposed
to being housed with a corporate shell that has very different growth prospects.
WESTERN UNION 2006 SPINOFF BY FIRST DATA
CORP
I
n 2006, First Data Corp decided to spinoff its Western Union unit rather than
keep it housed with the overall First Data corporate umbrella. First Data, which
itself was spun off by American Express in 1992, is a credit card processor. These
are companies that process and keep track of credit card charges and provide
other related services, such as sending out credit cards to consumers. Over the
2004–2005 time period, First Data’s core business suffered signiﬁcantly as rivals,
such as Total Services Systems, aggressively attacked its market share. While its
overall ﬁnancial performance was weak, one bright spot it had was its money
transfer business—Western Union. While the credit card processor business was
deteriorating, Western Union’s business was booming.
It is ironic that Western Union is such a high-growth business, as it was founded
in 1851. It began as a communications company and built the ﬁrst trans-Atlantic
telegraph. While so many of the companies founded at that time have long gone
by the wayside, Western Union continues to adapt to a changing marketplace
and is thriving. It is now the largest money transfer company in the world, with
annual revenues of $4 billion. The company does 275 million transactions per year,

using 271,000 agencies throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the United
States.a It has been able to fuel its growth through a broad international expansion
strategy. However, much of the great progress Western Union was making was
difﬁcult to see, when housed within a mundane credit card processing business. The
logical conclusion was to release Western Union in a tax-free spinoff to First Data
Corp. shareholders and let them realize the beneﬁts of Western Union’s anticipated
continued success.

Liquidity of the Market for Corporate Assets
An obvious factor that should affect the likelihood that a firm may divest a unit is the
strength of the demand for that unit. This reasonably would not be the primary factor
as one would think that business strategy and financial performance would play a more
prominent role. The role of the liquidity of the market for divested assets was confirmed
by Schlingemann, Stulz, and Walking, who analyzed a sample of 168 divesting and
157 discontinuing firms over the period 1979–1994.6 They found that market liquidity
helps explain which units of a business, especially a diversified business, will be sold and
which will be retained or discontinued. As with much of M&A research, this is a very
intuitive result.
Cash Flow Needs
A company may sell off even a well-performing unit if it encounters pressing cash flow
needs and if the unit is not essential to its corporate strategy. A sell-off may produce
the immediate benefits of an infusion of cash from the sale. The selling firm is selling a
long-term asset, which generated a certain cash flow per period, in exchange for a larger
payment in the short run. Companies that are under financial duress are often forced to
sell off valuable assets to enhance cash flows. Beset with the threat of bankruptcy in the
early 1980s, Chrysler Corporation was forced to sell off its prized tank division in an
effort to stave off bankruptcy. International Harvester (now known as Navistar) sold its
profitable Solar Turbines International Division to Caterpillar Tractor Company Inc. to

short-term debt in half.
Cash flow factors also motivated the aforementioned sales of Hertz by Ford in 2005
(see case study ahead) as well as the sale by GM of 51% of GMAC in 2006. These divi-
sions were profitable and commanded good prices in the marketplace while bringing
much-needed cash that these two auto companies used to offset sizable operating losses.

Corporate Restructuring
FORD MOTOR COMPANY SELLS OFF HERTZ
I
n the 2000s, both Ford and General Motors (GM) steadily lost market shares
to foreign competitors such as Toyota and Honda. These competitors were not
hamstrung by the burdensome labor agreements that Ford and GM were forced to
deal with. This allowed Toyota and Honda to establish manufacturing plants in the
United States and pay laborers a fraction of the costs that Ford and GM were forced
to pay. In addition, both companies face huge “legacy” costs of future pension and
health-care costs for retired employees. When sales of previously hot vehicles, such
as SUVs, turned down as consumer tastes changed, both companies began to incur
large losses.
In prior years, both Ford and GM had vertically integrated. They built up
large suppliers that they eventually spun off as Visteon and Delphi. The union
liabilities, however, forced Ford to take back Visteon while GM still maintained
responsibilities for Delphi labor costs. As its position began to worsen, Ford was
forced to sell off its forward vertical integration unit—Hertz. Hertz is one of the
market leaders in the U.S. car rental market. Even though Hertz is a leading car
rental company, Ford’s sales to Hertz did not generate high proﬁts, as car rental
companies typically buy using high-volume discounts that provide low proﬁts for
auto manufacturers. The beneﬁt of the high-volume purchases, however, while not
very proﬁtable, allowed auto manufacturers to maintain market share and keep
their plants operating at a high capacity. This was necessary, as Ford and GM were
forced to make payments to union workers even when they did not need all their
capacity. The union compensation commitments to employees became mainly ﬁxed
costs for Ford and GM, while these same costs were more variable for foreign auto
companies such as Toyota and Honda.
In 2005, Ford decided to sell off Hertz to a consortium of private equity ﬁrms,
including Clayton Dublier & Rice, Carlyle Group, and Merrill Lynch Global Private
Equity. The sale of Hertz, which was reported to have an enterprise value of $15
billion, brought a cash infusion into Ford. The beneﬁts of this additional cash
provided Ford some respite from ﬁnancial pressures while it worked on a major
restructuring to restore the company to proﬁtability. The strategy began to bear
fruit by 2010, when Ford returned to proﬁtability.
Abandoning the Core Business
The sale of a company’s core business is a less common reason for a sell-off. An example
of the sale of a core business was the 1987 sale by Greyhound of its bus business. The
sale of a core business is often motivated by management’s desire to leave an area that
it believes has matured and presents few growth opportunities. The firm has usually
already diversified into other more profitable areas, and the sale of the core business
may help finance the expansion of these more productive activities. Another example
of this was Boise Cascade’s decision to sell off its paper manufacturing production busi-
ness and become an office products retailer through its prior acquisition, OfficeMax.
OfficeMax was acquired by Boise Cascade in 2003 for $1.15 billion as part of a vertical
integration strategy, as Boise Cascade made paper products that were ultimately sold
through retailers such as OfficeMax. However, over time the paper production business

became less attractive while the retail distribution business gained in appeal. In 2008
Boise Cascade sold off its paper division to an investment firm. However, in 2013
Boise’s parent, Packaging Corporation of American (PCA), reacquired Boise’s paper
and packaging assets.
DIVESTITURE AND SPINOFF PROCESS
Each divestiture is unique and takes place in a different sequence of events. A generalized
six-step process is briefly described here:
Step 1. Make a divestiture or spinoff decision. The management of the parent company
must decide whether a divestiture is the appropriate course of action. This decision
can be made only after a thorough financial analysis of the various alternatives has
been completed. The method of conducting the financial analysis for a divestiture
or spinoff is discussed later in this chapter.
Step 2. Formulate a restructuring plan. A restructuring or reorganization plan must be
formulated, and an agreement between the parent and the subsidiary may be nego-
tiated. This plan is necessary in the case of a spinoff that will feature a continuing
relationship between the parent and the subsidiary. The plan should cover such
details as the disposition of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities. The plan should
include details such as the formation of a divestiture team including members
of management from a cross-section of corporate functions, including human
resources, legal, accounting, and finance.7 The work of this group can be quite
varied, including activities such as negotiating with buyers or handling the various
human resources issues that may arise when employees may be transferred to
another company or when they may even be terminated. The larger the unit being
divested, the more managerial resources tend to be invested in the planning and
implementation process.
In cases in which the subsidiary is to keep certain of its assets while others
are to be transferred back to the parent company, the plan may provide a detailed
breakdown of the asset disposition. Other issues, such as the retention of employees
and the funding of their pension and, possibly, health-care liabilities may need to be
addressed.
Step 3. Sell the business. In the case of a divestiture, a buyer must be found. This is often
done using the services of an investment banker, which may facilitate the process.
The seller and its banker will identify possible buyers and market the company
to them. They will usually prepare a confidential memorandum featuring a large
amount of relevant information buyers would be interested in. Once interest is
received, a negotiating process may ensue. In the case where multiple offers are
received, the most advantageous one will be selected.
Step 4. Get shareholder approval of the plan. The extent to which approval of the plan is nec-
essary depends on the significance of the transaction and the relevant state laws.

ken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2008), 10–22.

404
◾
Corporate Restructuring
In cases such as a spinoff of a major division of the parent company, stockholder
approval may be required. If so, the plan is submitted to the stockholders at a stock-
holders’ meeting, which may be the normally scheduled shareholders’ meeting or
a special meeting called to consider only this issue. A proxy statement requesting
approval of the spinoff is also sent to stockholders. The materials submitted to stock-
holders may address other issues related to the meeting, such as the amendment of
the articles of incorporation.
Step 5. Register the shares. If the transaction requires the issuance of shares, then this
stock must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
As part of the normal registration process, a prospectus, which is part of the
registration statement, must be produced. The prospectus must be distributed to all
shareholders who receive stock in the spun-off entity.
Step 6. Complete the deal. After these preliminary steps have been taken, the deal may be
consummated. Consideration is exchanged, and the division is separated from the
parent company according to a prearranged timetable.
Market Liquidity and the Decision to Divest a Unit
Various factors can motivate a company to sell a unit. One of the most obvious is poor
performance of that business. One would think that this would be the most fundamental
and obvious factor. Surprisingly, research by Schlingemann, Stulz, and Walkling, how-
ever, shows that market liquidity is actually more important.8 In an analysis of 168
divesting companies over the years 1979–1994, they found that companies in indus-
tries that were more liquid were more likely to be divested. In a liquid market, sellers will
have a better opportunity to receive the full value, if not an even higher value, for their
asset than in markets that are less liquid. Schlingemann et al. measured liquidity by the
volume of assets that were being sold in a given time period. So when firms want to divest
an unrelated segment as part of a focus enhancement program, those that can sell in liq-
uid markets will be more likely to do so, whereas those that face less liquid market may
hold on to a unit until market liquidity improves.
Round-Trip Wealth Effects
When a company announces an acquisition, in many cases the market response is neg-
ative. The research we have just reviewed indicates that when a company announces a
sell-off, perhaps a prior acquisition, the market response is often positive. This raises the
question: What is the net, round-trip effect? Marquette and Williams analyzed 79 acqui-
sitions and 69 spinoffs over the period 1980 to 1988.9 They examined the shareholder
wealth effects of both the acquisition and subsequent spinoffs of the acquired entity.
They tried to determine if paired acquisitions and sell-offs, what they called flips, draw-
ing on real estate terminology, generate on average positive or negative values. If the

value was positive, then we might conclude that M&A has a positive impact even if the
acquired entity is subsequently sold off. However, their results really did not indicate
a positive or negative effect—mainly a neutral response. While they did find negative
effects for acquisitions and positive ones for sell-offs, the combined effects were not sta-
tistically significant. There was, however, an interesting exception. When the target was
a research and development (R&D)–intensive business, and where there is evidence that
the parent may have supplied capital to fuel the target’s R&D needs, the net effect was
positive. Hypothetically, we could imagine this type of effect when a huge capital-filled
conglomerate, such as GE, acquires a growing R&D–intensive business. Here the parent
can accelerate the target’s growth. If the target does not fit into the parent’s long-term
plans, then it could possibly be sold off at a higher value, in part based on the parent’s
capital contributions during its ownership of the target. Here we can make a more con-
vincing argument for the benefits of financial synergy.
Wealth Effects of Sell-Offs
A major motivating factor for divestitures and spinoffs is the belief that reverse synergy
may exist. Divestitures, spinoffs, and equity carve-outs are basically a downsizing of
the parent firm. Therefore, the smaller firm must be economically more viable by itself
than as a part of its parent company. Several research studies have analyzed the impact
of spinoffs by examining the effect on the stock prices of both the parent company
and the spun-off entity. This effect is then compared with a market index to determine
whether the stocks experience extranormal performance that cannot be explained
by market movements alone. Spinoffs are a unique opportunity to analyze the effects
of the separation because a market exists for both the stock of the parent company and
the spun-off entity.
The research in the field of sell-offs, whether they are divestitures, spinoffs, or other
forms of asset sales, such as equity carve-outs, presents a picture of clear benefits for
shareholders.
Price Effects of Voluntary Sell-Offs
While there is a larger body of research on the shareholder wealth effects of sell-offs on
the selling company, there are enough studies on the impact on buyers to also draw
meaningful conclusions. Let us first focus on the effects on sellers.
Effects of Sellers
Table 11.2 shows an increase in stockholder wealth resulting from corporate sell-offs
has a weighted average abnormal shareholder return of 1.2%. This is derived from a
large number of studies over a long time period—1963–2005. The equity market clearly
concludesthatthevoluntarysellingofadivisionisapositivedevelopmentthatwillresult
in an increase in the value of the firm’s stock.
There are good intuitive explanations for the positive market reaction to sell-offs. If
a company is selling a unit, it often may be because it is no longer a good strategic fit.

Perhaps it was a diversification acquired in a prior acquisition. It could be that the
company was a drain on the overall performance of the business. This was the case
when GE, which for a period of time profited handsomely from its expansion into
financial operations, was badly burned in the subprime crisis. In the years that followed,
the company began to reduce its reliance on financial earnings through sales of
assets, such as its retail lending business. This move appealed to shareholders who
see GE as more of an industrial company and worry about exposure to financial-type
businesses.

Clearly, one of the benefits of sell-offs is to enable the seller to be more focused—
presumably, in areas it excels in. We will revisit the increased focus explanation a little
later in this chapter in the context of sell-offs through spinoffs.
Effect of Buyers
While the market is often not keen on acquisitions, it is more positive when it comes
to acquiring a unit of another company. Table 11.3 shows that the average abnormal
return to buyers is also 1.2%. However, a closer examination of Table 11.3 reveals that
the weighted average of 1.2% is significantly influenced by the Benou et al. study, which
showed a 2.3% return.10 Most of the other studies showed returns between 0% and 1%.
Nonetheless, the market seems to be somewhat positive about acquisitions of units of
other companies. There is an intuitive explanation for both the seller and buyer effects.
As we have noted, for the seller it may involve getting rid of a unit that is no longer a good
strategic fit. However, what kind of company may be in the market for purchasing such
a unit? Often, it is a company that is already in that very business. For the buyer, this
may be a good complementary fit and an extension of a business in which it has already
had some success. In such instances, it would be reasonable to have a positive market
response for the seller and the buyer.
Corporate Governance and Sell-Offs
Managers may be reluctant to sell off a unit—especially if they played a role in its acqui-
sition. The sell-off ends up being an admission of a mistake, which is something that

Review of Economics 48, no. 3 (August 2008): 505–519.

Corporate Restructuring
many managers are reluctant to do. Owen, Shi, and Yawson analyzed a sample of 797
divestitures over the years 1997–2005.11 Consistent with other related research, they
found that divestitures created wealth. However, their most significant contribution to
the research literature was to determine the role that corporate governance played in
the divestiture decision and the magnitude of the positive wealth effect.
They found that companies with more independent boards and large blockholders
had greater positive shareholder wealth effects. Their research implies that the deci-
sion to divest needs more than the obvious recognition of poor performance on a unit
or a poor fit of that unit within the overall company. It seems that management often
needs some pressure from independent directors and large equityholders to be suffi-
ciently motivated to “do the right thing.” In the United States, this pressure has often
come from hedge funds that acquire significant blocks of stock in undervalued compa-
nies,withtheirgoalbeingtoforcevalue-increasingcorporaterestructuring.However,in

totheconcernsofsmallershareholderswhoopposethecompany’sacquisitionstrategies
and who would want to pursue sell-offs that could release value to the shareholders.
MANAGERIAL OWNERSHIP AND SELL-OFF GAINS
Many companies have used various incentives to try to deal with the agency problems
and align the interests of management and shareholders. One of the main compensa-
tion tools is stock options that make managers also owners. This does not eliminate
the agency problems, as managers still may get the bulk of their compensation from
nonequity-based sources, such as salary and perks. Hansen and Song analyzed a sam-
ple of 152 divestitures.12 They found that not only did sellers enjoy positive shareholder
wealth effects but also these effects were positively related to the equity ownership of
managers and directors. This is an intuitive result as it shows that when managers and
directors are playing with their own money, they are less likely to hang on to losers.
ACTIVISTS AND SELL-OFFS
One trend that has been relatively prominent in recent years has been the aggressive-
ness of activists. These are typically hedge funds that monitor and analyze companies,
especially diverse companies, with a mind toward seeing if structural changes could
improve shareholder return. For example, in 2011 William Ackman and his Pershing
Square fund acquired an 11% stake in the conglomerate Fortune Brands. Fortune
Brands was an odd mix of businesses that included the fourth-largest liquor company

in the world, the Titleist line of golf products, and a home and security business that
included well-known brands such as Moen, Master Locks, Simonton Windows, and
Therma Tru Doors. The combination of liquor, golf products, and home products is hard
to explain. As a result of Ackman’s pressure, Fortune sold off the Titleist and Footjoy
businesses to a group of foreign investors.
Activists analyze the public filings of diverse companies and will try to ascertain if
some of the divisions show low margins. If that is the case, then the overall margin of
the company can be improved by a sale of the lower-margin businesses. From an activist
perspective, it may also be convenient if the overall company’s performance is less than
spectacular. Other disgruntled investors may then be very receptive to a quick solution
of a sell-off of a lower margin business—a “solution” that management may have a hard
time explaining why they did not pursue without external pressure.
Spinoffs
In a spinoff, the parent company gives shares in the business it is getting rid of to share-
holders in accordance with their ownership interest in the parent company. A spinoff is
an alternative to an outright divestiture, where the company sells the unit and receives
cash or other consideration. An example of a spinoff was MetLife, Inc.’s 2017 spinoff
of Brighthouse Financial—its U.S. life insurance and annuity business. This spinoff was
motivated by MetLife’s desire to separate the slow-growth U.S. life and annuity business
from the rest of the company. It was also hoped that an independent Brighthouse might
be more nimble being on its own and could possibly grow faster.
The spun-off entity then becomes a separate business that is independent of the par-
ent company. Shareholders of the parent are also shareholders of the spun-off business,
but the two companies usually operate independently. There is a pro rata distribution to
the parent company’s shareholders, which is usually done through a dividend. Because
the spinoff is done through the payment of a dividend, the courts usually regard dividend
payments as part of the normal responsibilities of the board of directors; thus, share-
holder approval is usually not required unless the amount of assets being spun off is
substantially the bulk of the company’s assets.
Later in this chapter we will contrast spinoffs with equity carve-outs. For now, we
can point out that in a spinoff, the shareholders involved in the transaction may stay
the same as the original company, whereas with a carve-out a new set of shareholders is
established. However, there are other variations that can be pursued, such as a sponsored
spinoff.Inasponsoredspinoff,anoutsidepartyacquiresaninterestinthespun-offentity.
Often, this is done by giving the sponsor an incentive in the form of a discount on the
price of the shares.
The debt of the overall company is allocated between the remaining parent
company and the spun-off entity. Usually, this is done in relation to the respective
post-transaction sizes of the respective businesses. If the company has warrants and

410
◾
Corporate Restructuring
convertible debt outstanding, the conversion ratio may have to be adjusted as the
stock price of a company may adjust downward in cases of more significant spinoffs.
Shareholders may directly gain by maintaining their shares in the parent company but
also receiving shares in the spun-off entity. Without some additional consideration,
warrant and convertible debt holders may not realize gains. Therefore, these factors
have to be taken into account when structuring the deal.
Spinoffs are usually easier to implement and also less expensive compared to equity
carve-outs. For example, one study found that carve-outs are also about four times as
expensive to implement as spinoffs.13 Spinoffs are also much less time-consuming to
implement than equity carve-outs.
If the business that is being spun off is well integrated into the parent company, then
there will usually be much more work that needs to be done creating a distinct and sep-
arate business that will be spun off. If, however, the business was a prior acquisition that
was not well integrated into the parent company, then the job may be easier.
Trends in Spinoffs
Spinoff dollar volume is quite variable, but it somewhat follows M&A volume. Like M&A,
spinoff volume in the United States fell after the subprime crisis but spiked up sharply in
2011, only to fall off again. There was a similar post–subprime crisis fall-off in Europe
that was preceded by a large spike in 2007. In Asia, there were sharp spikes in 2007 and
2015thatwerefollowedbysharpfall-offs.Therewasmoreofareboundintheyearsafter
the 2007 spike than took place in Europe (see Figures 11.3a, b, and c).
Tax Treatment of Spinoffs
One of the major advantages of a spinoff over an outright divestiture is that the spinoff
may qualify for tax-free treatment. This can be done if the transaction meets certain
Internal Revenue Code requirements (Sections 354 and 355). These rules can be com-
plex, which is why tax attorneys are an integral part of the M&A team in most deals but
especially spinoffs. Among the requirements to qualify for tax-free treatment is that the
parent company must own at least 80% of the shares of the unit being spun off. In addi-
tion, the parent company must not have acquired control of the unit less than five years
ago. The transactions must also satisfy the business purpose test. That is, it should not
be done only as a means of avoiding taxes. If, for example, the seller can convincingly
assert it is doing the deal to increase its focus and depart a business that is no longer
a good strategic fit, then this should be acceptable. The added benefit, then, is tax-free
treatment. However, the business purpose does not have to be the sole purpose—only
part of the reason for the spinoff.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Spinoffs
Not surprisingly, the market likes spinoffs. These transactions accomplish many of the
same objectives of divestitures but without the possible adverse tax effects. Table 11.4

Activists, Spinoffs, and M&As
Sometimes activists believe that a unit, or even a large part of a target, could be readily
sold at an attractive premium. It could be more difficult to sell the overall company if

that company includes some unattractive parts. A recent example was Alcoa, which had
a volatile commodity business along with a manufactured products business that was
more attractive—especially if it implemented efficiency improvements (see case study
later in this chapter). One simple “solution” in the eyes of activists was to have the overall
company spinoff the less marketable business—in that case, Alcoa’s aluminum.
After a spinoff, the spun-off entity may be more of a pure play. With a more focused
business, it may be easier to find strategic buyers for the business. If this can be done,
the sellers may be able to realize a premium on the marketable part of the business, thus
releasing value to investors. Housed within a large entity where the unit may be grouped
with a slow-growth or troubled entity, that value might stay trapped.
Changing Trend in Spinoff Returns
Figure 11.4 makes a very convincing case for the beneficial effects of spinoffs. Activist
hedge fund managers have been quite aware of the relevant research results and have
pressured many target companies to implement spinoffs to try to realize short-term
gains on the holdings they amass on targets. When we look at the performance over
the period 2011–2014, as reflected by the performance of the Guggenheim S&P Spinoff
ETF relative to the S&P 500, we see that spinoffs performed better than the market
(see Fig 11.4a).14 However, Figure 11.4b shows that situation reversed itself over the
years 2015–2017. Perhaps the earlier deals were done more for long-term strategic
reasons as opposed to some of the more recent ones that may have been the product of
short-term activist hedge fund pressures.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Spinoffs: Parent and Subsidiary
Effects Evidence
Cusatis, Miles, and Woolridge examined the common stock returns of both spinoffs and
their former parent companies.15 Unlike some prior research studies, which mainly
examined the shareholder returns leading up to and including the announcement
of the spinoff, the study by Cusatis et al. tracked the companies after the spinoff to
determine what the more long-term wealth effects were. These researchers examined
815 distributions of stock in spun-off firms from 1965 to 1988.
The Cusatis et al. research presents a very favorable picture of the postevent
performance of spinoffs. Both spinoffs and their parent companies showed positive
abnormal returns over a period that ranged between 6 months before and 36 months
after the stock distribution date. Another interesting finding of Cusatis et al. was that
both the spinoff and the parent company were more active in takeovers than the control

group of comparable firms. This takeover activity may help explain some of the positive
shareholder wealth effects. When the firms that were involved in takeovers were
removed from the sample, the returns were still positive but not statistically different
from zero.
Spinoff versus Sell-Off Decision
When a company is considering separating a business unit from the overall company
they have various options, including doing an outright sale of the unit, a divestiture
or sell-off, or doing a spinoff. Prezas and Simonyan analyzed the factors that could
explain which route companies in general take.16 They analyzed a sample of almost
4,200 sell-offs and 378 spinoffs over the period 1980–2011. They hypothesized that
firms whose assets were overvalued relative to their intrinsic value would choose to
sell them off so that they lock in their value. This hypothesis proved to be accurate.
Companies with lower valuations tend to choose spinoffs. They also chose spinoffs
when investors’ demand was strong as that could lead to quickly improved values for
shareholders who received shares in the spun-off entity. They also found that while both
spinoffs and divestitures enjoy positive shareholder wealth effects, spinoffs generate
higher values.
Spinoffs and Bondholder Wealth
We have seen that spinoff announcements are associated with positive shareholder
effects. This, though, gives rise to the natural question—are these positive market
responses for shareholders coming at the expense of bondholders? Early research
failed to find evidence of such wealth transfers.17 Later research by Maxwell and Rao
reached a different and richer conclusion.18 Maxwell and Rao studied the bond market
responses in 80 spinoffs over the period 1976–1997. They found that bondholders
suffered a negative abnormal return of 88 basis points in the month of the spinoff
announcement. Factors such as the loss of collateral value and bankruptcy protection
from the spun-off assets seem to be a good explanation for this response. This explana-
tion is buttressed by their finding that it was more likely that companies would have
their bond rating downgraded in the month of the spinoff. The loss of bondholders is
contrasted with an average gain of 2.9% for shareholders and an increase in firm value
of 1.6% during the same month. The higher the shareholder gain, the greater was the
loss to bondholders. However, the positive impact on shareholders and firm value is
only partially explained by a wealth transfer from bondholders.

Corporate Restructuring
AT&T BREAKUP: ONE OF THE MORE FAMOUS
SPINOFFS
A
T&T has undergone several restructurings in its history. Before AT&T broke up
in 1984, it dominated the local and long-distance telecommunications business
in the United States. With an eye on more exciting industries, such as the computer
business, AT&T parted ways with its “boring” local operating companies. These
businesses were spun off into seven regional operating companies: Ameritech,
Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex, Paciﬁc Telesis, Southwestern Bell, and U.S. West.
Several of these “Baby Bells” later merged, such as Nynex and Bell Atlantic, which
combined to form Verizon, which would eventually become one of the largest
telecommunications companies in the United States. AT&T shareholders received 1
share in each of these regional companies for every 10 shares they held in AT&T.
They also still owned 10 shares in the new AT&T, which would prove to be a
company that would engage in some of the more notable merger failures in merger
history. Indeed, the surviving AT&T would eventually be acquired by one of its
progeny—Southwestern Bell.
The AT&T that emerged from the spinoff had the unenviable track record of
conducting some of the worst mergers in history. AT&T proved to be a company
that had difﬁculty learning from its mistakes and would proceed to initiate ever
larger merger blunders. The spinoff of the operating companies allowed AT&T to
enter the computer industry, as an antimonopoly consent decree had prohibited it
from using revenues from its telecommunications businesses to ﬁnance competitive
ventures into other industries. When AT&T was unsuccessful with its computer
business, it acquired NCR in a hostile acquisition and greatly overpaid after it
encountered resistance from the target. Cultural rifts created further problems, and
AT&T eventually broke itself up into three parts.
Recovering from wounds received in the fourth merger wave, a new manage-
ment team decided to outdo its predecessors in the merger ﬂop business. AT&T’s
management envied the growth and proﬁtability of its progeny, such as Verizon. It
wished to be able to offer local phone services. Unfortunately, while it was once in
this business, it had given it all away in the fourth merger wave so as to be able
to enter the computer business, in which it failed. The ﬁfth-wave version of AT&T
wanted to gain access to local phone markets and believed that two cable targets,
MediaOne and TCI, would enable it to accomplish this. It also wanted to be a
one-stop shop, offering long distance, mobile, and local telecommunications plus
cable for its customers. Readers know to be wary when management is offering cus-
tomers a one-stop shop. AT&T announced that it was paying approximately $100
billion for its two cable acquisitions. After it bought the companies (rushing the
sellers through without doing its own proper due diligence), it discovered that the
acquired local cable lines could not support telecommunications services without
a major capital infusion. Once again, AT&T blundered in the M&A area—with each
blunder being larger than the last one. Not long after the deals, AT&T announced
it was breaking itself up—again. It is ironic that after this latest M&A debacle and
breakup, AT&T was acquired in November 2005 by one of the companies it had
previously spun off—SBC. SBC then assumed the AT&T name.

Shareholder Wealth Effects of Spinoffs: U.S. versus Europe
◾
417
SHAREHOLDER WEALTH EFFECTS OF SPINOFFS:
U.S. VERSUS EUROPE
Much of the research literature of the shareholder wealth effects of sell-offs, and spinoffs
in particular, focuses on U.S. companies and markets. Boreiko and Murgia analyzed
97 European spinoffs.19 They found that in Europe, spinoffs were often triggered by
what they called “governance earthquakes,” such as the appointment of a new CEO or a
threat of a takeover. Indeed, Shimizu and Hitt analyzed a sample of U.S. divestitures and
also found that the appointment of a new CEO increased the probability of a unit being
divested.20
Corporate spinoffs have been more common in England than in continental
Europe, although they are becoming more frequent in continental Europe. The typical
ownership structure in Europe is more concentrated than it is in England or the
United States.21 This puts continental European shareholders, other than those large
controlling equityholders who are often family-related, in a less influential position
than their British counterparts.
Like much of the research on U.S. spinoffs, Boreiko and Murgia’s European sample
showed positive shareholder wealth effects for spinoff announcements. Also consistent
with U.S. findings, they found higher (5.7%) effects for focus-enhancing spinoffs than for
non–focus-enhancing deals (3.3%). However, they did not find operating performance
improvements at parent companies after the spinoff, but they did find such effects for
the spun-off entity. The spun-off firms that had the greatest improvements were not
ones that enabled the parent to be more focused but typically were internally grown
units. This contrasts with research on U.S. spinoffs, which tended to show performance
improvements only for focus-enhancing deals.
Wealth Effects of Voluntary Defensive Sell-Offs
We discussed in previous sections the positive wealth effects of voluntary sell-offs. There
is some evidence that when these voluntary sell-offs are used as an antitakeover defense,
positive effects may not exist. Loh, Bezjak, and Toms found positive shareholder wealth
effects to voluntary sell-offs that are consistent with the other research that has been
discussed.22 However, they found that this positive response was not present when com-
panies used sell-offs as an antitakeover defense.
In a sample of 59 firms from 1980 to 1987, 13 of which featured takeover spec-
ulation, Loh, Bezjak, and Toms found cumulative average abnormal return equal to
1.5% over a one-day period up to the sell-off date. However, when they divided their

Corporate Restructuring
sample into two subsamples—those with and without takeover speculation—the 13
firms that were the targets of takeover speculation failed to show any significant changes
in shareholder wealth. These results suggest that when firms engage in sell-offs to pre-
vent themselves from being taken over, the market treats the transactions differently and
does not consider it a positive change.
Wealth Effects of Involuntary Sell-Offs
Most research studies on the effects of sell-offs on stockholder wealth conclude that
sell-offs increase the wealth of parent company stockholders and that the market is
somewhat efficient in anticipating the event. Therefore, the stock price reaction occurs
in advance of the actual sell-off date. The wealth-increasing effects of a sell-off of an
unwanted or poorly performing subsidiary should be different from those of a parent
company being forced to divest itself of a profitable division. This was the case when
Santa Fe–Southern Pacific received its unfavorable ruling requiring it to divest itself of
the Southern Pacific Railway. As noted previously, the stock price declined and Santa Fe
became a takeover target.
In 1981, Kudla and McInish conducted a case study of the effects of the required
spinoff of the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation by Georgia-Pacific, the parent company.23
The spinoff was required by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which concluded
that the acquisition of 16 companies in the southern part of the United States, which
accounted for a total of 673,000 acres of pine trees, would result in an anticompetitive
concentration in the plywood industry. Using cumulative residuals to adjust for market
effects, Kudla and McInish showed that the price of Georgia-Pacific stock had been
declining before the formal filing of the FTC complaint. Louisiana-Pacific was spun off in
1972. However, this downward movement ended with the spinoff, after which the stock
price rebounded. Although the stock price rebound was significant, the cumulative
residuals did not fully recover to the start of the 1971 level, even as late as March 1974.
A study by Miles and Rosenfeld showed that the wealth of bondholders declined
after the spinoff even while the wealth of stockholders increased.24 This was believed
to be attributed to the lower cash flows after the spinoff and the resulting increase in
risk to bondholders. Kudla and McInish attempted to measure the risk effects of the
involuntary Louisiana-Pacific spinoff by examining the betas of Georgia-Pacific before
and after the spinoff. The betas would then reflect any change in the systematic or
undiversifiable risk associated with Georgia-Pacific stock. Kudla and McInish found a
large, statistically significant increase in the betas of Georgia-Pacific after the spinoff.
They attributed this increase to the market’s perception that Georgia-Pacific incurred a
decrease in monopoly power after the spinoff and that this caused the firm to be riskier.
The finance research community seems to have reached a consensus that a divesti-
ture that is forced by government mandate, as opposed to a voluntary sell-off, will have
an adverse effect on the divesting firm’s stock price. Ellert’s review of 205 defendants in
antitrust merger lawsuits showed a 21.86% decline in the value of the equity of these

Wealth,” Journal of Finance 38 (1983): 1597–1606.

firms during the month the complaint was filed.25 The issue that the Kudla and McInish
study addresses is the timing of that impact and the reversal of the declining trend.
If the antitrust enforcement is effective in reducing the selling firm’s monopoly
power, this should be reflected in an increase in the value of the equity of that firm’s
competitors. Unfortunately, the antitrust authorities can find little support for their
actions in the stock prices of the competitors of divesting firms.26 The value of the
equity of competitors of divesting firms failed to show a significant positive response to
mandated sell-offs.
Corporate Focus and Spinoffs
One of the benefits a company can derive through a sell-off is to become more focused.
This is particularly true for companies that have become diversified and suffer from
having their shares trade at the diversification discount. This is not to imply that all
diversified companies trade at such a discount. For example, for many years GE, a highly
diversified industrial conglomerate, was the darling of the market, and its CEO, Jack
Welsh, was one of the world’s most popular CEOs. This all changed when the company
moved heavily into financial services, which bore great fruit for the company until the
company was taken by the subprime crisis. Following the overexposure to financial ser-
vices the company began to refocus on more industrial businesses.
We now discuss focus-related benefits in the context of spinoffs. However, while
many of the studies use spinoffs to demonstrate focus-related benefits, they also apply
to other types of sell-offs, such as divestitures or equity carve-outs.
Similar positive effects of focus-increasing spinoffs were found by Desai and Jain. In
an analysis of 155 spinoffs over the years 1975–1991, they found that both announce-
ment period as well as long-term returns were significantly higher for focus-increasing
spinoffs compared to non–focus-increasing spinoffs.27
Dale, Mehrotra, and Sivakumar conducted a study of 85 spinoffs over the period
1975–1991, in which they examined the relationship between spinoffs and corporate
focus by comparing the performance of spinoff firms when the parent company and
the spun-off entity were in two different Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes
(cross-industry spinoffs) relative to instances in which both were in the same SIC code
(own-industry spinoffs).28 They found improvements in various measures of perfor-
mance, such as the return on assets, for cross-industry spinoffs but not for own-industry
deals. They conclude that cross-industry spinoffs create value only when they result
in an increase in corporate focus. They attribute the performance improvements to
companies removing unrelated businesses, allowing managers to concentrate their
efforts on the core business, and removing the distraction of noncore entities.

Corporate Restructuring
Are all types of increased focus transactions the same? One study by Dasilas and
Leventi shed light on which types of focus-increasing spinoffs had the greatest positive
shareholder wealth effects.29 They compared spinoffs that increased industrial focus
with those that increased geographical focus. They found that spinoffs that increased
industrial focus generated positive shareholder wealth effects, while those that increased
geographical focus did not. In addition, the positive market response to increases in
industrial focus was greater for U.S. spinoffs than it was for European deals.
ALCOA SPINOFF FROM “ARCONIC”
I
n November 2016, Alcoa completed its spinoff from the larger entity that was
formerly known as Alcoa but that afterward took the name Arconic. The new,
more focused, Alcoa remains an industry leader in the aluminum industry. Under
the terms of the spinoff agreement, Arconic (the parent) retained 19.9% of the new
Alcoa—the spun-off entity. The former shareholders received one share of the new
Alcoa for every three shares they held, and they also retained their old shares in the
former Alcoa, which became Arconic shares.
Like many such events in securities markets, it was long anticipated. Alcoa
had been in existence for 127 years, so for those familiar with the expansion of
the company, this was not a surprise. The combined company featured the key
commodity-based business that was the original Alcoa, and this business, like most
commodity-oriented businesses, could be volatile as a function of the vicissitudes of
the market for, in this case, aluminum. In recent years, commodity prices, including
aluminum prices, have been depressed, and that naturally affected the ﬁnancial
performance of the combined Alcoa (see Figure A).

Corporate Restructuring
(continued )
As of the date of the spinoff, the combined market cap of the two companies
was $12.5 billion, with Alcoa (AA) constituting one-third of the value and Arconic
(ARNC) the remainder. Alcoa is a miner/manufacturer and the world leader of baux-
ite, alumina, and aluminum. This entity houses the combined company’s mining,
smelting, and reﬁning businesses. Alcoa beneﬁts when the demand from China
is strong. China plays a key role in the aluminum market, as it is both a huge
producer/supplier and a demander. As global demand, including demand from
China, slowed, most global producers slowed production except for Chinese pro-
ducers, which continued to produce. This is an example of the irony of the Chinese
economy—ﬁrms, especially the many that have large government stakeholders, may
produce, even if it does not make economic sense for them, so as to keep workers
employed.
Arconic manufactures “multi-material” products, including not just aluminum
but also nickel and titanium. These products are used in many commercial
applications for aircraft and automobiles, and are also used in the oil and gas
and construction industries. Thus, the company engineers various parts for these
industries using commodities that are the basis of Alcoa’s business.
The goal of the breakup was to enable what is now Arconic to take advantage
of growth in sectors such as the aerospace industry while limiting exposure to the
ups and downs of a commodity markets. In consideration of overall weakness in
commodity markets, Arconic was released from the pressures while also becoming
a noncommodity player that has its cash ﬂows based more on the performance of
successful manufacturing industries such as aircraft, construction, and automobiles.
These sectors can do very well when the global economy is growing and not so
much when it is in recession.
In late 2015, Alcoa came under pressure from the activist ﬁrm Elliot Manage-
ment. However, even after the separation of the two businesses, Arconic remained
under pressure from Elliot Management, which pushed for the ouster of Klaus Klein-
feld, who was the CEO of the combined company. Investors expressed great concern
about the weak performance of Arconic’s stock (see Figure B). The post-breakup
performance of these two companies is a good example of why a spinoff is no
longer a panacea or path to quick gains. It is also the reason why Elliot did not
end the pressure on Arconic after Kleinfeld left. Shortly afterward, Elliot was able to
place three members on Arconic’s board.
Corporate Split-Ups
Sometimes companies can pursue a diversification strategy, and the market supports
it through higher equity values. This can often happen when we are in a bull market
and the rising tide is carrying with it all ships—if not carrying them equally. However,
while the market may be sometimes slow to catch on to the failings of a given conglom-
erate’s “strategy,” it eventually may change its view of the multiple combinations that
make up the company. When this happens, the company’s management will be under
pressure to make significant changes, and this often means sell-offs if not an outright

split-up. AT&T and ITT did this each more than once. However, there are several other
examples, including Cendant, Sara Lee, and Tyco. The goal is to separate the businesses
so that there is greater focus and the enterprise becomes more manageable. With a more
focused business, the market can better understand the overall strategy. This may allow
the company to appeal to investors who are seeking investments in a specific sector.
CENDANT: SPLIT-UP OF A CONGLOMERATE
I
n October 2005, the board of directors announced that it had approved a proposal
to split up Cendant, an $18 billion conglomerate that had been built through a
series of acquisitions over many years. The Cendant of 2005 included the real
estate companies Century 21 and Coldwell Banker; car rental businesses Avis, the
second-largest car rental company in the United States, and Budget; hotel chains
Days Inn, Ramada, and Super 8; and travel companies Orbitz, Cheaptickets.com,
and Galileo International (an international network of travel agents). The company
merged with CUC International in 1997, and that deal was a disaster due to the
bogus ﬁnancials of CUC. CUC proved to be one of the bigger ﬁnancial frauds in
history. While the stock price took a difﬁcult short-term hit due to this problem, it
recovered due to the fact that the upper management of Cendant, including its
CEO Henry Silverman, was not involved in this fraud and worked hard to correct
the problem. However, over the years 2003–2005, while the market steadily grew,
Cendant stock was weak and even declined (see Figure A). Management ﬁnally
came to the resolution that the market did not understand or like the confusing
combination of companies housed within the Cendant corporate structure.
In 2004, Cendant recognized that its conglomerate structure was a problem.
It tried to take some steps to correct it while not really admitting that the whole

overall structure was problematic. Toward that end, the company parted ways with
its mortgage business, PHH Corp., the Jackson Hewitt Tax Services business, and
Wright Express, which is a ﬂeet management company. PHH Corp. was spun off
while Cendant did an equity carve-out of its Jackson Hewitt unit. Jackson Hewitt is
an example of a business, tax preparation, that is pretty far removed from the other
travel-related businesses housed within Cendant. Its combination with Cendant’s
other businesses made little sense. The market liked these deals, as the stock
performance of the carved-out businesses exceeded that of Cendant.
Before approving the split-up, Cendant’s board considered other options, such
as leveraged recapitalization and more sales of other business units.a However, the
board ﬁnally decided that halfway measures would not ﬁx the problem and that the
market wanted more focused businesses, not the combination that CEO Silverman
had put together. The combination may have worked well for Silverman and his
personal goals, but not for investors.
Four new businesses formed from the split-up:
1. Travel
2. Car rental
3. Hospitality/hotels
4. Real estate
When we look at the preceding combinations, one can see that the ﬁrst three
have a common travel connection, so one could theorize that there might be
synergistic beneﬁts. A review of the history of other attempts to combine such
travel businesses, such as what United Airlines tried to do, reveals that extracting
synergies from such combinations would be hard. However, one lesson we are
always aware of in M&As is that managers and investors have short memories and
tend to repeatedly make the same mistakes.

EQUITY CARVE-OUTS
An equity carve-out is a public offering of a partial interest in a wholly owned subsidiary,
although the seller could, theoretically, sell as much as the entire 100% in the offer-
ing. Usually, however, that is not the case and only a partial interest is sold. Most of the
time, the seller retains control of the unit, although the carve-out may be the first step
in selling off the entire business. By retaining a high percentage of the shares of the sub-
sidiary, one that is equal to or greater than 80%, the parent retains the right to do a
tax-free spinoff in the future. Thus, equity carves are often two-step transactions (see
Figure 11.5).
By retaining at least 50%, the parent can consolidate the businesses for tax pur-
poses. Allen and McConnell found that on average parents retained just under 70% of

their carved-out unit’s shares, while Vijh found parents retained almost three-quarters
of the unit’s shares.30
Equity carve-outs are often linked to some subsequent event. For example, a parent
company may first do an equity carve-out where it sells some of the shares it owns in
a subsidiary but may follow that translation by a spinoff of the remaining shares to its
own shareholders. By issuing some equity, the seller establishes a market value for the
unit, which may be used in the eventual total separation of the business from the parent.
Thus, the carve-out can enable the parent to “test the waters” for the market’s appetite
for the unit’s shares. If this does not look promising, it may simply require the unit’s
shares—thus, canceling the “sale.”
The shares can be sold by the unit itself, or the parent can sell the shares. If the par-
ent sells the shares, this is called a secondary offering. If the subsidiary does the selling,
it is referred to as a primary issuance. The primary offering has no tax consequences,
but a secondary offering could result in capital gains taxes for the parent. This is why
most equity carve-outs are primary issues. When the unit sells the shares, it receives the
proceeds. This gives rise to a decision about what to do with the proceeds. One option
is to leave them with the unit. Another is to pay them to the parent—but in a way that
will not have adverse tax effects. One way to do that is to have the unit issue a note
or debt obligation to the parent as a dividend prior to the carve-out. When the unit
receives the share proceeds, it can pay off the note. Many firms look to equity carve-outs
as a means of reducing their exposure to a business that they believe is no longer a
good strategic fit or that has higher risk than what it prefers. For example, American
Express bought the brokerage firm Shearson in 1981. It later acquired the investment
bank Lehman Brothers to form Shearson Lehman. This is a riskier line of business than
American Express’s traditional credit card operations. American Express later decided
that, although it liked the synergy that came with being a diversified financial services

company, it wanted to reduce its exposure to the risks of the securities business. In 1987,
Amexco, its holding company, sold off a 39% interest in Shearson Lehman. This proved
to be fortuitous because the sale preceded the stock market crash, an event that secu-
rities firms still had not recovered from by the end of the 1980s. The company would
later completely undo these acquisitions. American Express would further streamline its
business in 2005, when it spun off its personal finance unit, which became Ameriprise
Financial Inc. This is yet another example of a related business that appeared to have
valuable synergies but that in reality did not.
One of the benefits of a partial interest carve-out is that it establishes a market for
the shares of the subsidiary. Hulbert analyzed a sample of 172 carve-outs and found
that most of the time the carve-out is a “temporary event.”31 By this he means that the
carved-out entity often does not stay independent. This happened roughly half of the
time; 20% of the time the unit’s shares were bought back by the parent; and 16% of the
time, the unit was acquired by another company.
Shareholder Wealth of Equity Carve-Outs
As with divestitures and spinoffs, equity carve-out announcements yield positive aver-
age abnormal returns. Drawing on a number of studies that considered a total of 1,251
carve-outs during 1965–2007, Eckbo and Thorburn found returns equal to 1.8% (see
Table 11.5). The explanation for these positive effects is similar to that of other forms
of sell-offs. The difference is the method by which the parent company accomplishes
the sell-off.
Characteristics of Equity Carve-Out Firms: Post Carve-Out
Performance
Eric Powers analyzed 181 equity carve-outs to try to determine the motives for the
transactions.32 Were the deals motivated by a desire of the parent to try to realize
increased efficiencies or were they trying to unload an overvalued unit? He found that
the carved-out companies’ financial performance, as measured by return on assets,
peaked at issue (17.2%) and then subsequently declined. He also found that other
measures, such as capital expenditures, profit margin, and sales growth, also declined.
He then compared this performance to that of the industries they were in and the
parent companies. He found that the carved-out subsidiaries performed better than
the industry peers. As we will discuss a little later, when we review the work of Allan
and McConnell, the comparative industry finding is not consistent with some other
research.
Powers found that the parent companies had fairly consistent performance (10.5%
per year) and did not decline after the carve-out. Thus, he found that at the time of

the transaction the subsidiaries that were carved-out subsidiaries performed better
than the parent.
Powers also found the parent companies sold a higher percentage of the units’
shares to the market when the financial performance of that business was worse.
That is, “The more the parent sells, the worse the carve out subsidiary performs in the
future.”33 He also found an inverse relationship between the liquidity of the parent and
the percentage of shares sold. It seems the parent companies trade ownership in the
subsidiary for cash—especially when their liquidity is low. While Powers found that
carved-out companies’ performance declined after they were separated from the parent,
other studies using different samples found just the opposite. For example, Hulbert,
Miles, and Woolridge found improvements in both the parent and the subsidiary relative
to their industry peers.34

performance and higher leverage than their industry counterparts. As Table 11.6
shows, pre-carve-out firms have lower interest coverage and higher ratios of long-term
debt and total debt to total assets. They also have lower ratios of EBDIT (earnings before
depreciation, interest, and taxes) to sales and total assets. Allen and McConnell also
traced the use of the carve-out proceeds. They found that when the funds were used
to pay down debt, the company showed an average excess return of +6.63%, whereas
when the funds were retained for investment purposes, the company experienced
a −0.01% return. Thus, they showed that the market’s reaction to the carve-outs
depended on what the company used the funds for.
Equity Carve-Outs versus Public Offerings
An equity carve-out, as opposed to a spinoff, brings in new capital to the parent com-
pany. Because the acquisition of capital is obviously a motivating factor for this type of
sell-off, we must investigate why the equity carve-out option may be chosen over a pub-
lic offering of stock. Katherine Schipper and Abbie Smith conducted a study of equity
carve-outs that examined the share price reactions to 76 carve-out announcements.
They compared these reactions with previous studies documenting the stock price reac-
tions to public equity offerings.36 Previous studies have shown that the announcement
of seasoned equity offerings results in an abnormal stock return of between 22% and
23% in the periods around the equity offering.37 In contrast to other equity financing
arrangements, Schipper and Smith found that equity carve-outs increase shareholder
wealth. Schipper and Smith found that the shareholders of the parent firms experienced
average gains of 1.8%. They compared this positive stock price effect with a 23% share-
holder loss for a subset of parent firms that engaged in public offerings of common stock
or debt.
Schipper and Smith propose that the positive stock price reactions are due to a com-
bination of effects, including better and more defined information available about both

ings,” Journal of Financial Economics 15, no. 1–2 (January/February 1986): 153–186.

are more negative for industrial firms than for public utilities, see Ronald W. Masulis and Ashok N. Korwar,

the parent and the subsidiary. This is clear to those who have attempted to evaluate the
subsidiaries of a publicly held company. The annual reports and other publicly available
documents may be very brief and yield little of the data necessary to value the com-
ponents of a company. When the subsidiary becomes a stand-alone public company,
it publishes more detailed information about its operations because its activities are its
only line of business, as opposed to merely being a part of a larger parent company.
Schipper and Smith also point out other possible factors responsible for the positive
stock price reaction to equity carve-outs, such as the restructuring and asset manage-
ment that tend to be associated with equity carve-outs. In addition, divisions may be
consolidated into a more efficient form, and managers may work with new compensa-
tion incentives. The combination of these and other changes may make the subsidiary
a more viable entity as a separate public company. The market’s perception of this value
may be a source of a premium for the selling company. The parent company, no longer
encumbered by a subsidiary that it could not manage as well as another owner might,
becomes more valuable when it converts this asset into cash, which it can, it is hoped,
invest in more productive areas.
Equity Carve-Outs versus Spinoffs
There are a number of important differences between spinoffs and equity carve-outs. A
carve-out results in a new set of shareholders, whereas the same shareholders hold stock
in the spun-off entity as in the parent company. There are positive cash flow effects in
carve-outs, but spinoffs do not result in initial changes in parent company cash flows.
Carve-outs are more expensive to implement and are subject to greater securities law
disclosure requirements.
In a study of 91 master limited partnerships (MLPs) that were created between 1981
and 1989, Michaely and Shaw found that, for their sample, riskier and more highly
leveraged firms chose to go the spinoff route rather than to opt for a carve-out.38 They
show in their study that bigger, less leveraged, and more profitable firms chose the
carve-out option. They conclude that the equity carve-out versus spinoff decision is
determined by access to capital markets. Those companies that have better access—that
is, more desirable firms in better financial condition—will choose to market themselves
to public markets and enjoy the positive cash flow effects of an equity carve-out.
Less desirable firms will be forced to choose the spinoff route. It should be noted that
although it may seem that the Michaely and Shaw results contradict those of Allen and
McConnell reported earlier, this is not the case. The Allen and McConnell results show
a comparison of carved-out firms with industry peers, whereas the Michaely and Shaw
study compares firms that did carve-outs with those that did spinoffs.
The Michaely and Shaw findings were supported by a study by Johnson, Klein,
and Thibodeaux.39 In their study of 126 spinoffs, they found that companies doing

Corporate Restructuring
the spinoffs were more highly leveraged and had lower asset growth than their
industry peers. They also helped shed light on the reasons for the positive stock market
responses to spinoffs. They found that following the spinoffs there were gains in the
cash flow margin on sales and asset growth for both the parent company and the
spun-off firm.
These studies clearly do not explain all spinoff versus equity carve-out decisions.
They do not address, for example, the large spinoffs of 1995, such as the ITT and AT&T
transactions. However, these research results provide much useful insight into other
types of transactions.
VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATIONS OR BUST-UPS
Voluntary liquidations, or bust-ups, are the most extreme form of corporate restructur-
ing. Corporate liquidations are more often associated with bankruptcy. A company may
be liquidated in bankruptcy when all parties concerned recognize that the continuation
of the firm in a reorganized form will not enhance its value. The outlook, however, is
not as negative for voluntary liquidations. In a voluntary liquidation, the general crite-
rion applied is as follows: If the market value of the firm’s assets significantly exceeds the
value of the firm’s equity, a liquidation may need to be seriously considered. This is not
to imply that liquidation should be an alternative in instances of a temporary downturn
of the firm’s stock. The liquidation option becomes viable only when the firm’s stock has
been depressed for an extended time or the business is simply not viable going into the
future. Even businesses with established name brands could possibly not be viable in the
marketplace. For example, as part of its restructuring, General Motors concluded that
such historically well-known brands as Pontiac, Saturn, and Saab had to be simply dis-
continued. GM tried unsuccessfully to sell Saab but could not find a buyer in a global
marketplace that featured great overcapacity. They then restructured the Saab division
as an independent company in 1989 but the company was forced to file for bankruptcy
in 2011 following the failure of an acquisition bid from a Chinese bidder when GM, still a
largeshareholder,opposedthedealbaseduponitsconcernthatthebidderwasseekingto
acquire its technology without paying a fair value. In 2012, Saab was restructured into
a new company, the National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), following an acquisition
from the bankruptcy estate of the company.
For whole companies, as opposed to divisions or brands within a company, the liq-
uidation option becomes even more likely when the stock prices of other firms in the
same industry are not also depressed. In addition, low price-earnings (P/E) ratios may
sometimes point to a need to consider the liquidation option. Managers are often reluc-
tant to consider such a drastic step, which would result in their loss of position. They
may prefer to sell the entire firm to a single acquirer rather than pursue liquidation.
Stockholders sometimes try to force management’s hand by threatening a proxy battle
to decide the issue.
Voluntary liquidations may be contrasted with divestitures. A divestiture is gen-
erally a single transaction in which a certain part of the firm is sold, whereas a vol-
untary liquidation is a series of transactions in which all the firm’s assets are sold in
separate parcels. Tax motives may make a liquidation more attractive than a divestiture.

Divestitures may be subject to capital gains taxes, whereas voluntary liquidations may
often be structured to receive more preferential tax treatment.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Voluntary Bust-Ups
Skantz and Marchesini’s study of liquidation announcements made by 37 firms from
1970 to 1982 showed an average excess return of 21.4% during the month of the
announcement.40 Hite, Owers, and Rogers found similar positive shareholder wealth
effects during the month of the announcement of voluntary liquidations made by the
49 firms in their sample, which covered the years 1966 to 1975.41 They showed a
positive abnormal return in the announcement month equal to 13.62%. Almost half
the firms in their sample had been the object of a bid for control within two years of the
announcement of the liquidation plan. These bids included a wide range of actions,
including leveraged buyouts (LBOs), tender offers, and proxy contests. Moreover, more
than 80% of the firms in their sample showed positive abnormal returns. This suggests
that the stock market agreed that continued operation of the firm under its prior
operating policy will reduce shareholder wealth.
The positive stock market reaction was affirmed by two other studies. Kim and
Schatzberg found a 14% positive return for 73 liquidating firms during a three-day
period associated with the liquidation announcement.42 They revealed that a 3% return
was added when shareholders confirmed the transaction. Kim and Schatzberg failed
to detect any significant wealth effect, either positive or negative, for the shareholders
of the acquiring firms. In a study of 61 publicly traded firms that completed voluntary
liquidations between 1970 and 1991, Erwin and McConnell found that voluntary
liquidations were associated with an even higher average excess stock return of 20%.43
They also confirmed the intuitive expectation that firms that decide to voluntarily
liquidate face limited growth prospects. The liquidation decision is the rational one
because it releases financial resources to be applied to higher-yielding alternatives. As
suggested previously, these research studies imply that the stock market often agrees
that the continued operation of the firm under its prior operating policy will reduce
shareholder wealth. This is not surprising because most firms that are considering
liquidation are suffering serious problems. Liquidation then releases the firm’s assets to
other companies that might be able to realize a higher return on them.
TRACKING STOCKS
In the 1990s, companies began to issue tracking stocks as alternatives to sell-offs. A track-
ing or targeted stock is an equity issue that represents an interest in the earnings of a

division of a company. It also is sometimes called letter stock or alphabet stock. Sometimes
when a company acquires other firms but the market prices of the combined entity sell
at a discount, the company may try to boost the stock by allowing one or more divisions
to trade separately as tracking stocks. AT&T did this with its AT&T Wireless segment.
Tracking stocks were first created in 1984, when General Motors (GM) acquired
Electronic Data Systems (EDS). Ross Perot, the colorful CEO of EDS, was concerned
that employees, who owned significant shareholdings in the company, would be less
motivated if they received shares in slow-growth GM in exchange for their fast-growing
shares in EDS. As a solution, they issued Class E shares, which tracked the performance
of the EDS division of GM. General Motors also used this mechanism in 1985 when it
issued Class H shares, which followed the performance of its Hughes Aircraft division.
Tracking stocks have also been used as a defense measure when a company is con-
fronted with a large and somewhat hostile shareholder. This was the case in 1991 in
the next use of a tracking stock, when Carl Icahn, a holder of 13% of USX, demanded
that the company spin off the steel division of the company, which owned U.S. Steel and
Marathon Oil. As an alternative and less drastic step, the company issued a tracking
stock for its steel and oil divisions.
One of the major differences between tracking stocks and sell-offs is that a separate
legalentityiscreatedinasell-off.Withatrackingstock,theshareholderhasalegalinter-
est in the earnings of a division, but that division remains part of the overall company.
Holders of targeted stock usually still retain their voting rights in the overall company. In
some instances, however, such as in the USX case, these voting rights may be adjusted
based on the market valuation of the targeted shares.
Tracking stocks do not represent an ownership interest in the assets of the entity
being tracked. This may make one wonder why the company does not simply do a spinoff
that would give holders shares that have such an interest. However, it may be the case
that the transaction would not qualify for tax-free treatment, and this would eliminate
one of the advantages of a spinoff.
After the issuance of the tracking stock, the parent company still has legal control of
the assets and the division and is a consolidated entity. The parent has the voting rights
of the tracking shares.
A tracking stock can be issued by a parent company in a couple of ways. One way
is to issue the shares to its shareholders as a dividend. However, it is more common for
the parent to simply have a public offering of the shares and receive cash in exchange.
Once these shares become listed with an exchange, it then has to have its own audited
financial statements and it does its own filings with the SEC. It does all of this while still
being part of the parent company and under its control. Since the shares were really
an offering of the parent company’s shares (since it owns the unit), there are no tax
consequences.
As with announcements of sell-offs, the market tends to react positively to
announcements of tracking stocks. D’Souza and Jacob found a statistically significant
3.61% stock price reaction within a three-day window of an announcement of proposed
tracking stock issues.44 D’Souza and Jacob tried to determine whether the creation of

tracking stocks achieves some of the same benefits that a company would receive if it
were a totally independent entity. They examined the correlation between the returns
of the tracking stock and the overall firm, as well as the correlation between the returns
of the tracking stock and similar firms in the tracking stock’s industry. They found a
greater correlation between parent firms and tracking stock returns than the returns
between the tracking stocks and their industry counterparts. That is, they found that
the “firm effect” was greater than the “industry effect.” They postulate that the firm
effect exists because of all the shared resources and liabilities that exist between the
division and the parent company. Clearly, a tracking stock is an intermediate step
between being totally independent and staying within the parent company.
The findings of positive announcement effects for tracking stocks are consistent
with other studies, such as those of Billet and Vijh, Chemmanur and Paeglis, Elder and
Westra, and Harper and Madura.45 These studies report positive announcement period
returns in the 2% to 3% range. However, given the limited number of issues of tracking
stocks, the available data cause us to be cautious about conclusions compared to other
types of restructurings, such as divestitures or spinoffs.
The evidence of the long-run performance of tracking shares is a “mixed bag.”
Chemmanur and Paeglis found that the shares of the 19 parent companies that issued
tracking shares underperformed over a three-year post-issuance period relative to
industry peers.46 This contrasted to the outperformance of the subsidiary relative to
its peers. Billett and Vijh examined 29 completed tracking stock restructurings over
the period 1984–1999.47 They found that shareholders of tracking stocks experienced
significant post-issue wealth losses. Shareholders of the parent company experienced
insignificant returns, although they incurred negative returns for the year prior to
the tracking stock restructuring announcement. These negative preannouncement
returns are not surprising as the issuance of a tracking stock is usually an attempted
partial solution to poor performance of the parent. The negative preannouncement
returns also contrast sharply with those of spinoffs and equity carve-outs.
MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND SELL-OFFS
Master limited partnerships (MLPs) are limited partnerships in which the shares are
publicly traded. A limited partnership consists of a general partner and one or more lim-
ited partners. The general partner runs the business and bears unlimited liability. This
is one of the major disadvantages of this form of business organization compared with

Corporate Restructuring
a corporation. In a corporation, the owners—the stockholders—are insulated from the
company’s liabilities. The limited partners in the MLP, however, do not incur the liability
exposure of the general partner.
The key advantage of the MLP is its elimination of the corporate layer of taxation.
Stockholders in a corporation are taxed twice on their investments: first at the corporate
level and then, with distributions in the form of dividends, at the individual level. MLPs
are not taxed as a separate business entity, and the returns to the business flow through
to the owners just as they do in other partnerships. This advantage was strengthened
by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which lowered the highest personal income tax bracket
to 28% (which is less than the top corporate rate of 34%). This advantage was reduced
when the tax law was changed in later years to raise the rate charged in the upper tax
bracket.
Corporations have used MLPs to redistribute assets so that their returns are not sub-
ject to double taxation. In a rollout MLP, corporations may transfer assets or divisions
in separate MLPs. Stockholders in the corporation are then given units of ownership in
the MLP while maintaining their shares in the corporation. The income distributed by
the MLP is not subject to double taxation.
MLPs may be involved in either spinoffs or equity carve-outs. In a spinoff, assets are
directly transferred from the parent company to the MLP. Parent company sharehold-
ers receive MLP units on a pro rata basis. In an equity carve-out, the MLP raises cash
through a public offering. This cash is then used to purchase assets of the division of the
parent company that is being sold off.
MLPs have been popular in the petroleum industry. Oil companies have distributed
oil and gas assets into MLPs, allowing the returns to flow directly through to stockhold-
erswithoutdoubletaxation.Initially,startupbusinessesmayalsobestructuredasMLPs.
The MLP may be run by a general partner, who receives an income from managing the
business. The general partner may or may not own a unit in the MLP. Capital is raised
through an initial sale of MLP units to investors.
MLPs are generally held by individuals as opposed to corporations, which are pre-
dominantly owned by institutional investors. This trend may be explained by observing
several differences between corporations and MLPs. Limited partners in MLPs do not
have control, which is an attribute that institutions are starting to value more. More-
over, corporate shareholders are normally taxed on their MLP income, as opposed to the
exclusion they would qualify for if they were receiving dividends from another corpora-
tion. In addition, even institutions that are normally tax-exempt may have their MLP
income taxed. For these reasons, MLPs are not very attractive to institutions.
While the MLP structure can provide attractive benefits for investors, it is not a
business structure that allows the entity to take all the same steps that a traditional
corporation would to grow in the long term. This is a restricting structure that pro-
vides clear financial benefits. This is why in 2014 Kinder Morgan announced that it
was acquiring three of its related MLPs and wrapping them all into its larger C corpora-
tion. The deal was very large—in the $70 billion range. The resulting structure is much
simpler, as prior to that there were four different equity securities related to the overall
business.

ITT: DISSOLUTION OF THE QUINTESSENTIAL
CONGLOMERATE
O
n June 13, 1995, the ITT Corporation announced that it would split the giant
conglomerate that was constructed during the third merger wave through the
acquisition of many dissimilar businesses throughout the world. The transaction was
one of the largest of its kind in history. It involved the creation of three separate
public companies, each with its own board of directors and each listed on the New
York Stock Exchange. Holders of ITT stock received one share of stock in each of
the new companies.
The breakup of ITT, once known as the International Telephone and Telegraph
Company, was an endorsement of the belief that the sum of the parts of the
company, as stand-alone entities, was worth more than the value of them combined
under the ITT umbrella. It was difﬁcult to ﬁnd many commonalities or synergies in
ITT’s diverse business interests; that is, it is a stretch to say that casinos and hockey
teams have much in common with casualty insurance or the hotel business.
One of the clear beneﬁts of splitting the company up was better access to
capital.
“We just think that having these three companies acting and operating and
being evaluated in their own business environment will provide investors, analysts
and those who deploy debt a simpler, more clear way to evaluate us,” said the
chairman, president, and chief executive of ITT, Rand V. Araskog.a
The $25 billion conglomerate that was built by Harold Geneen was split into
three companies: an insurance company, ITT Hartford; an industrial products ﬁrm,
ITT Industries; and a casino, hotel, and sports company, ITT Corporation. During the
1960s and 1970s, ITT had acquired more than 250 companies, including Avis Rent
A Car, Continental Baking Company, Canteen, Rayonier, Sheraton Hotels, Hartford
Insurance Company, and others. ITT sold what was originally its core business in
1986. At that time, it sold its telecommunications operations to Alcatel Alsthom
(CGE France).
The three new companies each included divisions that shared common
elements for which there might be some synergies. For example, many of the
managerial skills and administrative systems necessary to run a hotel are somewhat
similar to those of casinos. Within the new ITT Corporation, Sheraton and Ciga
hotels were combined. Also included in this company was the Madison Square
Garden (MSG) sports arena, along with two of the major users of the arena, the
New York Knickerbockers and the New York Rangers. In addition, the company had
a partnership arrangement with Cablevision System Corporation—the New York
cable television company that offers the MSG cable programming that televises the
games of these teams. In 1997, ITT sold Madison Square Garden and its interests
in the sports teams to Cablevision.
The breakup of ITT was typical of the transactions that took place in the
mid-1990s, when the pressure to increase efﬁciency rather than pursue convoluted
acquisitions strategies was the way of the day. Whereas the third and fourth merger
waves featured many questionable acquisitions, the early to mid-1990s featured
more strategic acquisitions, in addition to the unraveling of many of the poorly
conceived deals of earlier periods.

CHAPTER TWELVE
Restructuring in Bankruptcy
A
S NOTED, MERGER AND acquisition (M&A) volume tends to move with the
ups and downs of the economy. When we have a strong economic expansion,
the likelihood that we may have a merger wave is higher. For example, this
was the case in both the fourth and fifth merger waves. When we have an economic
downturn, M&A volume tends to decline. It is in such downturns that we tend to see
more bankruptcies.
In an economic downturn, revenues often weaken while costs may be slower to
decline. In addition, companies may have increased their debt levels during the expan-
sion, which can leave them in a vulnerable position during a recession. In the years
2003–2007, corporate and household leverage rose to new heights. Many companies
could not service their higher debt levels when the economy turned down in 2008, and
we entered the Great Recession. The natural result of the combination of a slow economy
and high leverage is increased bankruptcies.
In addition to being a drastic step that companies take when they become insolvent,
bankruptcy can also be a creative corporate finance tool. Reorganization through the
bankruptcy process can in certain instances provide unique benefits that are unattain-
able through other means. This chapter explores the different forms of bankruptcy in the
United States and discusses the circumstances in which a company would use either of
thetwobroadformsofcorporatebankruptcythatareavailableunderU.S.law:Chapter7
and Chapter 11. Chapter 7, liquidation, is appropriate for more severely distressed com-
panies. Chapter 11, reorganization, however, is the more flexible corporate finance tool
that allows a company to continue to operate while it explores other forms of restruc-
turing. In addition, Chapter 11 allows the management of a bankrupt company to stay
in control while the company pursues reorganization.

Restructuring in Bankruptcy
TYPES OF BUSINESS FAILURE
Clearly, bankruptcy is a drastic step that is pursued only when other more favorable
options are unavailable. A bankruptcy filing is an admission that a company has in
some way failed to achieve certain goals. The term business failure is somewhat ambigu-
ous and has different meanings, depending on the context and the users. There are two
main forms of business failure: economic failure and financial failure. Each has a very
different meaning.
The word bankruptcy actually comes from a combination of two Latin words: bankus,
which means bank, and ruptus, which means broken. Some have traced these words to
a tradition in Italy in the 1800s, when Italian merchants did business on benches. If one
of their businesses failed, their benches would be broken by other merchants as a way of
letting the failed business know it was no longer welcome in the area.
Economic Failure
Of the two broad types of business failure, economic failure is the more ambiguous.
For example, economic failure could mean that the firm is generating losses—that is,
revenuesarelessthancosts.However,dependingontheusersandthecontext,economic
failure could also mean that the rate of return on investment is less than the cost of
capital. It could also mean that the actual returns earned by a firm are less than those
that were forecast. These uses of the term are very different and cover situations in which
a company could be unprofitable, as well as cases in which the company is profitable but
not as profitable as was expected.
Financial Failure
Financial failure is less ambiguous than economic failure. Financial failure means that a
company cannot meet its current obligations as they come due. The company does not
have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its current liabilities. This may occur even when the
company has a positive net worth, with the value of its assets exceeding its liabilities.
Costs of Financial Distress
Financial distress is a condition where a company has difficulty meeting its promises
to creditors. This condition tends to bring with it certain costs that may include direct
costs, such as legal and accounting fees, as well as indirect costs that can come from
the market’s reaction to a company that may not honor its commitments to securities
holders.
Andrade and Kaplan conducted a study of 31 distressed, highly leveraged
transactions (HLTs) consisting of management buyouts (MBOs) and leveraged recap-
italizations.1 They focused on firms that were financially but not economically
1 Gregor Andrade and Steven N. Kaplan, “How Costly Is Financial (Not Economic) Distress? Evidence from
Highly Leveraged Transactions That Became Distressed,” Journal of Finance 53, no. 5 (October 1998):

distressed. They traced the causes of the distress to a pre- versus post-HLT leverage,
as measured by the median ratio of book value of debt to total capital, 0.21 versus
0.91, and median ratios of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization
(EBITDA) interest coverage of 7.95 versus 1.16. Their analysis points to the higher
leverage as the cause of the financial distress. They then compared the value of the
company over a period of two months before the HLT until the resolution of the distress.
The resolution was defined as the date they either exited Chapter 11, were sold, issued
new equity, or were liquidated. They conclude that the changes brought about by
the HLTs and the subsequent distress result in an increase in value. It is important to
note that their conclusions are relevant only to financial distress, not to economic
distress.
George and Hwang examined the relationship between distress costs and capital
structure in a large sample of companies over the period of 1966–2003.2 Their analy-
sis results in a very intuitive finding—firms with high distress costs tend to have lower
leverage (so as to try to avoid default) and have lower probabilities of default. However,
the operating performance of low-leverage firms deteriorates much more rapidly when
in financial distress since these firms are much more sensitive to financial distress. Pre-
sumably, knowing their vulnerability to distressed situations, the companies adjust their
capital structure to employ less leverage so that they avoid being in distress.
CAUSES OF BUSINESS FAILURE
Dun & Bradstreet conducted a study of the causes of business failure. They found that
the three most common factors, in order of frequency, were economic factors, such as
weaknessintheindustry;financialfactors,suchasinsufficientcapitalization;andweak-
nesses in managerial experience, such as insufficient managerial knowledge (see Table
12.1). The last factor highlights the role of management skills in preventing bankruptcy
and is one reason workout specialists focus so strongly on managerial skills when they
are working on a company turnaround.
Dun & Bradstreet also analyzed the average ages of the businesses that failed (see
Table 12.2). They found only 10.7% of the failures were in business for one year or
less. Just under one-third of the companies had been in business for three years or less,
whereas 44.3% existed for up to five years.
Causes of Financial Distress following Leveraged Recapitalizations
Financial distress and bankruptcy have been linked to many of the highly leveraged
deals that took place in the 1980s. As discussed in Chapter 8, leveraged buyouts
(LBOs) became popular during this period, along with the use of leveraged recapital-
ization as an antitakeover defense. Denis and Denis conducted a study of 29 leveraged

recapitalizations that took place between 1984 and 1988.3 They define leveraged
recapitalizations as transactions that use proceeds from new debt obligations to make a
payout to shareholders. Their results show that 31% of the firms that completed lever-
aged recapitalizations encountered financial distress. This is contrary to what had been
hypothesized by other researchers, such as Kaplan and Stein, who had asserted that
failures of leveraged transactions were due to overpricing and poor financial structure,
Denis and Denis conclude that although these factors are important, the 1990–1991

recession and the regulatory factors were the reason some leveraged recapitalizations
failed and others did not.4 They did find that distressed firms had similar but somewhat
higher debt levels and lower interest coverage. However, distressed firms required more
postdeal cash than nondistressed firms. For example, the cash needs of distressed firms
required them to sell an average of 6.3% of their assets, whereas nondistressed firms
would have had to sell only 3.6% of their assets. Distressed firms also had to achieve
greater postdeal performance improvements. For example, in order to meet the postdeal
debt service, distressed firms would have had to have a median increase in operating
income of 41.8%, compared with 18.9% for nondistressed firms.
Given the reliance on postdeal asset sales, regulatory changes and the recession
of 1990–1991 played a key role in the failure of the leveraged recapitalizations. These
regulatory factors were related to the collapse of the junk bond market in the late 1980s.
Following the difficulties of this market, certain financial institutions were forced to
sell off their junk bond holdings, which hurt the ability of potential junk bond issuers
to sell new bonds. This, in turn, limited the resources available to buyers of assets of
companies that engaged in leveraged recapitalizations.
The limited resources lower the values that leveraged recap firms could realize from
asset sales. Many of these firms overestimated the prices they would receive for assets,
such as divisions. This error was partially related to not being able to anticipate the dra-
matic changes that occurred in the junk bond market. The difficulties of the market
for assets were compounded by the recession of 1990–1991, which made performance
improvement more difficult to achieve.
Whenaneconomyturnsdown,asitdidinthe2008–2009recession,debtpressures
become more pronounced as cash flows may weaken. In addition, downturns are a poor
environment in which to conduct asset sales to pay down debt.

cash, which can be used to pay down debt or alleviate cash flow pressures. In this section
we discuss asset sales prior to a bankruptcy filing. Later in this chapter we discuss assets
sales while in Chapter 11.
Lang, Poulsen, and Stulz found that asset sales often follow a period of poor stock
market performance.5 As we discussed in Chapter 11, these assets sales are often fol-
lowed by increases in the seller’s stock price. This is an intuitive result. A weak stock
price may reflect that the company is not using its assets to its maximal benefit and/or
that these assets may be more valued by other firms. Selling the assets coverts them into
cash, which can either be returned to shareholders through a dividend or stock repur-
chase, used to pay down debt, or reinvested in the company (hopefully not into other
assets that also will generate a weak return).

Restructuring in Bankruptcy
Brown, James, and Mooradian failed to detect a stock uplifting effect in their study
of 62 distressed companies.6 While one might think that it is a good idea for financially
distressed firms to use the proceeds from asset sales to pay down debt, the results from
Brown et al.’s analysis of those 62 companies showed that the announcement returns
for those companies were lower than for the distressed companies that did not use the
monies to pay down debt. In addition, they found that the greater the proportion of
short-term debt in their total liabilities, the greater the probability that the proceeds
would be paid out to creditors. The authors conclude that the asset sale and subsequent
creditor payout decision could be the result of pressure applied by the creditors. The fail-
ureoftheequitymarketstorespondfavorablyisunderstandableasthevalueoftheassets
is going to creditors and not for the benefit of stockholders. So stockholders lose both
the assets and the proceeds, although they may benefit from the overall leverage of the
company being lower.
Research by Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein studied junk bond issuers that got
into financial distress.7 Only 3 of the 21 companies in their sample that sold off more
than 20% of their assets had to file bankruptcy. These firms were able to use asset sales
asameanofavoidingabankruptcyfiling.Theyalsofoundthatcompaniesinanindustry
that was distressed had trouble selling assets. This empirical observation was expected
by Shleifer and Vishny, who concluded that when an industry is distressed, assets may
sell at fire-sale discounts.8 The importance of industry conditions for asset sale prices
was also supported by research by Maksimovic and Phillips in their study of the sales
of assets by manufacturing firms.9 In addition, the more specialized the assets are, the
less useful they are to those outside the distressed industry and the greater the expected
fire-sale discount.
Asset Fire Sales: Case of the Airline Industry
Pulvino analyzed fire sales in the airline industry, an industry that has had more than its
share of bankruptcies, including multiple bankruptcies by the same carriers. He looked
at sales of aircraft by companies that were in Chapter 11 or Chapter 7. He found that
the prices the bankrupt companies received were significantly lower than nondistressed
airlines that sold aircraft. In addition, his research failed to find any difference in the
fire-sale discounts between those firms that were in Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. Clearly,
the airline industry is interesting as the assets are specialized and cannot be readily
sold to firms outside the industry. While specific airlines could have unique problems
that are not shared by others, the airline industry is quite cyclical as well as very sensi-
tive to fuel prices. Therefore, it is not unusual to see a strong economic downturn or a

sharp rise in fuel costs cause widespread distress among many airlines. Those that are
in the best financial condition with the least leverage may be able to survive the tumult.
Those that are not in good condition or find themselves unable to service high debt lev-
els when they experience weak revenues or higher fuel charges may have to resort to
downsizingthroughassetssales.Theproblemtheymayexperienceisthatthemostlikely
buyers probably are also experiencing weakened revenues and are not in the market
to expand their fleet. This may force the seller to sell to financial institutions specializ-
ing in this industry, which might drive a hard bargain with the distressed seller. Indeed,
this is what Shleifer and Vishny envisioned with their model wherein pools of outside
money would seek to acquire assets at significant discounts and sell them at a later time
at higher prices.
Even when the whole industry is not in the doldrums, distressed firms may be forced
to still sell assets at fire-sale prices. This was the case when Peoples Express overexpanded
and also when Eastern Airlines fought a battle with its unions. Peoples Express, which
had too quickly gone from a small regional carrier to being a national, and even interna-
tional, airline, was forced to sell to Texas Air’s subsidiary, Continental Airlines. Eastern
was a high-cost airline that was acquired by union-busting cost-cutter Frank Lorenzo,
who had an all-out battle with machinists, and then their supporters, the pilots and
flight attendants unions. He lost this battle and was forced to sell off parts of the airline
to Continental but at fire-sale prices and eventually had to file for bankruptcy. Ironically,
the employees were not really winners, either, because when the airline shut down oper-
ations, it laid off thousands of employees.
LEHMAN BROTHERS: BIGGEST BANKRUPTCY IN
HISTORY
T
he subprime crisis, and the ensuing global recession that followed, took its
toll on businesses across the world. The ﬁnancial services sector was one of
the major causes of the downturn. As a result of the ﬁnancial crisis, three of the
ﬁve largest independent U.S. investment banks no longer existed as vibrant and
independent institutions. Along the way, Bear Stearns was acquired by JPMorgan
Chase and Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America. These two acquisitions
were facilitated by the assistance of the federal government. However, in the case
of Lehman Brothers, no assistance was forthcoming.
The fact that an investment bank that existed for over 100 years could so quickly
fail is surprising. While there are many reasons for the failure, clearly at the top of
the list is managerial failures. Many ﬁnancial institutions invested heavily in real
estate and mortgage-related investments. Many of the public wrongly believe that
the leaders of Wall Street’s top ﬁnancial institutions are astute investors and buy at
good prices and sell at the right time. However, in the case of Lehman, as well as
many of the larger ﬁnancial institutions, including some that were favored by the
government, such as Goldman Sachs, this was far from the case.

Lehman, run by its CEO, Dick Fuld, a man who has been reported as out of
touch with his managers and in-house experts, led the company into assuming
tremendous leverage while making massive investments in various aspects of the
real estate market. For example, Lehman had acquired mortgage issuer Aurora Loan
Services and helped transform it into one of the larger players in the Alt A mortgage
market, which is the market for loans that require little or no documentation. It also
acquired another aggressive mortgage issuer by the name of BNC. Fuld oversaw
the acquisition of very expensive real estate, not buying at good prices but at the
peak of the market in 2007! These were not astute investors who learned a great
deal from their decades of experience in the investment world. Rather, they were
“me too” followers, lacking any imagination or ability to see an extreme bubble
while they sat at the top of it. Lehman was not alone in this incompetence, as
Stanley O’Neil led Merrill Lynch down the road to failure while also extracting great
compensation from the company.
Lehman employed extreme leverage but, like most investment banks, relied
on short-term ﬁnancing in the commercial paper market to ﬁnance its long-term
investments at the peak of the market and was ﬁnanced by extreme leverage. While
one would think that normally a board of directors would be vigilant and try to keep
management from making such foolish blunders, this board lacked the skill set and
diligent efforts to properly monitor management.
When the mortgage market turned down, a number of aggressive investors
began to short Lehman’s stock. As its stock price fell, the market woke up to
Lehman’s many investment errors. Fuld probably could have sold the company for
some positive value early in the process, but he added to his errors by refusing
to accept Lehman’s fate and get the best deal for shareholders. The result is that
Lehman Brothers no longer exists, although parts of its business are now owned by
Barclay’s, which has proﬁted by Lehman’s management’s poor judgment.a

BANKRUPTCY TRENDS
When an economy slows, revenue growth weakens at many companies. This puts many
companies under financial pressure—especially those that had assumed higher debt
burdens. In a robust economy, many companies assume leverage to facilitate growth,
such as to finance M&As. Too often, management is shortsighted and believes that the
“good times” will continue and they will be able to service the higher debt loads. Even
though recessions are a fact of life in the world economy, too often management is sur-
prised when a recession arrives and their revenue growth slows.
Figure 12.1 shows that when economic growth picked up between 2005 and 2006,
total U.S. bankruptcies fell sharply. Figure 12.2 shows a similar trend for Chapter 11

in 2007 and eventually go into a recession in 2008–2009, total bankruptcies and
Chapter 11 filings rose. This is also seen in Figure 12.3, which shows a dramatic rise in
the total assets of companies that filed for bankruptcy in 2008. This intuitive procycli-
cal trend in these filings is confirmed by other research.10 As the economy recovered
from the Great Recession, total and business bankruptcies declined in the years
that followed.

Fraud-Related Bankruptcies
Table 12.1 shows the causes of bankruptcy based on research by Dun & Bradstreet prior
to the huge bankruptcies that occurred at the end of the fifth merger wave. This research
shows that only 1.2% of the time is fraud the cause of bankruptcy. This changed in a
big way in the 2000s when we had such notable U.S. bankruptcies as Lehman Broth-
ers, WorldCom, and Enron. Both corporate giants were brought down by management
fraud. Some of the larger bankruptcies were caused by fraud. Two of the more notable
ones were Adelphia and Refco. These bankruptcies have led to changes in laws such
as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While Enron’s bankruptcy is not related to M&A, World-
Com’s failed merger strategy and the company’s inability to achieve organic growth
were closely related to its ultimate demise.
Fraud-related bankruptcies were not a U.S.-exclusive phenomenon. In December
2003, the Italian food group Parmalat Finanziaria SpA announced that it would file for
bankruptcy protection. This bankruptcy shocked the European corporate world when it
was revealed that a fraud of this magnitude could take place in a company that was an
international household name.
Comment on Largest Bankruptcies Data
Table 12.3 lists the largest bankruptcies by asset size without an adjustment for infla-
tion. If such an adjustment was made, and all asset values were presented in same year
terms, the list would be somewhat similar, but some famous earlier bankruptcies would
appear on it. For example, the bankruptcy filing by Penn Central in 1970 listed assets at
that time of $6.85 billion. However, this value would equal approximately $43 billion in
2015 dollars.

REFCO BANKRUPTCY CAUSED BY FRAUD
R
efco was a futures-trading ﬁrm that provided execution and clearing services
for exchange-traded derivatives. The company also served as a prime broker
in the ﬁxed income and foreign exchange markets. It did business with different
hedge funds and various investment companies. At its peak, it employed over 2,000
employees and had over 200,000 customer accounts.
In 2004, 57% of Refco was acquired in a leveraged buyout (LBO) by the private
equity (IPO) ﬁrm Thomas Lee Partners. This transaction was followed by an initial
public offering in 2005. The proceeds of the sale went to several purposes, including
cashing out equity positions of pre-IPO shareholders as well as retiring debt and
paying pre-IPO shareholders’ dividends. However, just two months after the IPO,
the company announced to the markets the existence of a previously undisclosed

receivable from an afﬁliated entity controlled by one Philip Bennett, the pre-LBO
CEO. However, this receivable had been previously disguised as an obligation from
an unafﬁliated third party. This was done through a fraudulent scheme that used
various “round-trip loans,” where monies were lent to a third party to make pay-
ments and create the illusion that the receivable was collectable. The total principal
amount of these loans was $6.25 billion. Rather than reduce the receivable, as the
loans were designed to appear to do, they actually increased it, as interest, which
accumulated to approximately $1.2 billion, was added to the principal. Following
the disclosure, an investigation was conducted and payment from Mr. Bennett and
the afﬁliated entity he controlled was demanded, but no such payment was made.
The disclosure led to a “run on the bank” and billions left customer accounts. The
stock collapsed from $28.56 on October 7, 2005, to $0.65 on October 18, 2005.
Refco was composed of some regulated and some unregulated businesses.
The regulated entities had cash reserves to handle the withdrawal requests, but
the unregulated ones did not. This left the company with no choice but to ﬁle
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 17, 2005. However, it was no
longer a viable business, and on November 25, 2006, it ﬁled a petition for relief
under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. Refco would become one of the largest
bankruptcies in U.S. history.
U.S. BANKRUPTCY LAWS
The Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (the Bankruptcy Code) is the main bankruptcy law of the
United States. It organized bankruptcy laws under eight odd-numbered chapters (see

Reorganization versus Liquidation
◾
449
Changes in the U.S. Bankruptcy Laws
Bankruptcy laws vary across countries. The United States and France have laws that
are somewhat favorable to bankrupt companies and their managers. Other countries,
such as Great Britain, Canada, and Sweden, take a harsher stance toward the bankrupt
companies and provide for fewer restructuring opportunities.
For many years, bankruptcy in the United States was governed by the Bankruptcy
Act of 1978. This law was enhanced in 1984 with the Bankruptcy Amendments and
Federal Judgeship Act, which established the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court as a
unit of the district courts. This law was in response to a Supreme Court ruling that chal-
lenged the jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts. The 1984 law also made it more difficult
to immediately void labor contracts in bankruptcy. This was in response to a Supreme
Court ruling in the Wilson Foods case, in which the court decided that companies could
abrogate existing labor contracts as soon as they filed for bankruptcy. The revised law,
which was passed partly because of labor union pressure, requires that a company try
to work out a labor agreement before going to the bankruptcy courts. If the sincerity of
the efforts of the parties is an issue, a bankruptcy court will decide whether each party
acted in good faith and under compliance with the law.
The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 enhanced the powers of the bankruptcy
courts. The Act gave these courts the right to issue orders that they deem necessary
or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In October 2005,
the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act was focused mainly
on personal bankruptcy and causes such as credit card abuse. However, the law did
contain some changes affecting Chapter 11 filings. We will discuss the rules that relate
to the length of what is known as the exclusivity period later in this chapter. Other
changes related to corporate bankruptcy involved limits on retention bonuses paid to
management. Managers receiving such bonuses must prove they have a bona fide job
offer at or near the retention bonus. Such a bonus cannot be greater than 10 times the
average incentives paid to retain nonmanagers.
Another change brought about by the 2005 law is the requirement that the debtor
in position has seven months after the filing to accept or reject leases. This is an impor-
tant requirement for retailers. It forces them to make a long-term commitment even
though the full reorganization plan may not be finalized and approved. Still another
change brought about by the new law is the requirement that the debtor in position
pay in full for all goods it received 20 days prior to bankruptcy. This eliminates some of
the benefits of doing a Chapter 11 filing but it also prevent supplies from being cut off for
companies that are rumored to be filing Chapter 11.
REORGANIZATION VERSUS LIQUIDATION
The purpose of the reorganization section of the Bankruptcy Code is to allow a reorga-
nization plan to be developed that will allow the company to continue to operate. This
plan will contain the changes in the company that its designers believe are necessary to

convert it to a profitable entity. If a plan to allow the profitable operation of the business
cannot be formulated, the company may have to be liquidated, with its assets sold and
the proceeds used to satisfy the company’s liabilities.
WILBUR ROSS: FINDING VALUE IN TROUBLED
BUSINESSES
C
ertain investors excel at ﬁnding valuable opportunities in troubled businesses.
Wilbur Ross, a former restructuring advisor at Rothschild and now Commerce
Secretary in the Trump administration, was a leader in the turnaround ﬁeld. He
quickly earned a reputation as a sought-after leader in turnarounds. He formed his
own Manhattan-based private equity ﬁrm, W. L. Ross & Co., which makes equity
investments in ﬁrms in dire need of restructuring. The steel industry in the United
States had been troubled since the 1980s, when some of its larger companies
proved to be unable to compete internationally due to their burdensome labor
cost structure combined with inefﬁcient plants, which caused them to lose market
share to rivals from countries such as Japan and South Korea. Ross recognized an
opportunity when he entered the steel industry in 2002 by buying a Cleveland steel
mill for $325 million. He continued to buy steel companies and combined them into
an entity called International Steel Group (ISG). He then took this company public
and sold to it Lakshmi Mittal of Mittal Steel 10 months later at an attractive 42%
premium.a With the addition of ISG, Mittal became the largest steel company in the
world. Ross’s business acumen is underscored by a comparison of the $2.165 billion
he paid for the ﬁve steel companies that made up ISG—LTV Corp., Bethlehem
Steel, Acme Metals, Weirton Steel, and Georgetown Steel—and the $5.1 billion
that Mittal paid for them.b
Ross also successfully acquired troubled textile businesses. He skillfully acquired
Burlington’s debt at deeply discounted prices after the textile maker ﬁled for
bankruptcy. In 2001, he ended up acquiring the company in bankruptcy for $614
million.
Following up on his success in the steel and textile industries, Ross then set his
sights on the troubled auto suppliers industry. This sector has a lot in common with
steel and textiles. Each has a high-cost labor force that has difﬁculty competing
in an increasingly international market that has many lower-cost competitors. In
2005, Ross formed the International Auto Components Group (IAC), which set
about acquiring various different international auto suppliers, such as the European
operations of Collins and Aikman Corp.

REORGANIZATION PROCESS
Although the Chapter 11 process varies somewhat depending on the particular cir-
cumstances of the bankruptcy, most Chapter 11 bankruptcies have certain important
common characteristics. These are highlighted next.

Reorganization Process
◾
451
Bankruptcy Petition and Filing
The reorganization process starts with the filing of a bankruptcy petition for relief with
the bankruptcy court. In the petition, the debtor lists its creditors and security holders.
Standard financial statements, including an income statement and balance sheet, are
also included. The court then sets a date when the creditors may file their proofs of claim.
The company then attempts to put together a reorganization plan while it continues its
operations. Contrary to what a layperson might think, there is no financial test that is
performed by the court at this time to determine whether the debtor is truly financially
insolvent.
The petition is usually filed in the federal district in which the debtor has its home
office. After the petition is filed, a case number is assigned, a court file is opened, and a
bankruptcy judge is assigned to the case.
Filing Location
A troubled company can file a bankruptcy petition in one of 94 regional bankruptcy
courts. The most common locations where bankruptcy cases are filed are Delaware and
the Southern District of New York. Unlike the decision of where to incorporate, corpo-
rations are supposed to file in a district either where they have their headquarters or
where they have a substantial percentage of their operations. Even though bankruptcy
laws are federal laws as opposed to state laws, companies can choose to file their cases
in specific local venues within the federal court system. There is some evidence that
companies that have reorganized in Delaware have a tendency to refile Chapter 11 in
Delaware later on.12 Others have concluded that there is insufficient evidence that such
a displayed preference for Delaware results in any losses for debtors.13
LoPucki and Whitford conducted a study of 43 large public firms that were in finan-
cial distress.14 They did find evidence that the companies engaged in “forum shopping,”
which refers to the phenomenon that companies may file in a location in which they
really do not have a substantial physical presence. This is done when they believe that
the courts in the most reasonable location, such as where their corporate headquarters
is located or where they have most of their facilities, would be more hostile to their pro-
posals and plans, such as requests for extensions of the exclusivity period, than some
other locations. This can be discerned from the experience of bankruptcy counsel in
these various jurisdictions.
Debtor in Possession
After the bankruptcy filing, the bankrupt company is referred to as the debtor in posses-
sion. This is a new legal entity; however, for all practical purposes, it usually is the same

companywiththesamemanagementandthesameemployees.Fromthecreditors’point
of view, this is one of the problems of the bankruptcy process; that is, the same manage-
ment that led the company into its financial troubles usually is still running the business
while a reorganization plan is being developed.
If the creditors strongly oppose the management of the debtor staying in control
of the business, they may petition the court and ask that a trustee and examiner be
appointed. If concerns exist about fraudulent actions or incompetence of the debtor’s
directors or management, the court may agree. A trustee is charged with overseeing
the operations of the company while it is in bankruptcy. An examiner may be appointed
to investigate specific issues. If the court denies a request for a trustee, an examiner is
usually appointed.
Automatic Stay
When the court accepts the petition, an automatic stay is granted. This is one of the
main benefits the debtor receives in the Chapter 11 process. During the automatic stay,
a halt is placed on any prepetition legal proceedings as well as on the enforcement of
any prefilling judgment. Creditors are unable to pursue a lien on the debtor’s assets or
to collect money from the debtor. Parties seeking relief from the stay may petition the
court and request a hearing. If the creditors can convince the court that the assets that
are being used as collateral for obligations due them are not necessary for the continued
operation of the company, or the debtor has no equity interest in the assets, they may be
able to get relief from the stay.
Timeline in the Reorganization Process
Table 12.5 shows some of the key events and dates in the Chapter 11 process. Within
10 days of filing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, the debtor is required to file a
schedule of assets and liabilities with the court. This schedule must include the name
and address of each creditor. The next important date is the bar date, which is the date
when those creditors who have disputed or contingent claims must file a proof of claim.
A proof of claim is a written statement that sets forth what is owed by the debtor to

the particular creditor. Failure to file by the bar date may result in the forfeiture of the
claim. It is automatically assumed, however, that other claimholders have filed a proof
of claim. Following the bar date, the next important dates are those associated with the
filing and approval of the reorganization plan.
Duration of the Chapter 11 Process
According to New Generation Research Inc., over the period 1982–2004 the average
duration of a Chapter 11 filing was 16.4 months. In more recent years, however,
this time period has been getting somewhat shorter. For example, over the period
2011–2015 the average duration was 13.8 months.
Use of Secured Creditors’ Collateral
The Chapter 11 process allows for the use of the secured creditors’ collateral by the
debtor in possession. Creditors are barred from seizing assets while the stay is in effect.
This does not mean that the debtor has free use of the property. The debtor must make
some accommodation to the creditors, such as periodic payments (i.e., monthly), for
continued use of the assets.
Duties of the Debtor in Possession
After the filing of the petition, the court establishes certain schedules that feature vari-
ous reporting requirements. For example, the debtor has to file monthly financial state-
ments 15 days after the end of each calendar month. In addition to the court rules as
set forth in the federal law, each federal district may have additional reporting require-
ments. For example, the Southern District of New York has local rules that relate to
further reporting requirements and the opening of bank accounts.
Stakeholder Committees
The Bankruptcy Code provides for various committees to be formed to represent the
interests of different claimholders before the court. The committees are usually com-
posed of the seven largest members of a given class who are interested in serving on
the committee. These committees have the power to hire their own attorneys and other
professionals to assist them. These expenses of these professionals are paid for by the
debtor-in-possession. A committee to represent the interests of unsecured creditors is
almost always appointed. Other committees, such as an equityholders committee, might
also be formed. The ultimate decision about which committees are formed is made by the
Executive Office of the Trustees or the court.
A creditors meeting is usually held within 20 to 40 days of the bankruptcy filing.
ThemeetingiscalledbytheU.S.trusteeandisusuallyheldathisoffice.Thedebtorandits
principal officers must be present at this meeting. All creditors may attend this meeting
and may ask the debtor specific questions that are of concern to them.
Along with the U.S. trustee, the creditors committee monitors the actions of the
debtor, ensuring that it does not do anything that would adversely affect the creditors’

454
◾
Restructuring in Bankruptcy
interests. The creditors committee may retain counsel, accountants, and other financial
experts to represent the creditors’ interests during the reorganization process. The fees
of professionals are borne by the debtor.
The bigger the bankruptcy, the more likely it is that there may be more committees,
such as an equityholders’ committee, or different types of creditors’ committees, such
as a bondholders’ committee, representing the various forms of debt that might exist.
One example of a megabankruptcy that had several committees was the bankruptcy
of the Campeau Corporation, which featured the bankruptcy of Campeau’s two major
subunits, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. In this proceeding,
there were several committees, including a bondholders’ committee and two trade cred-
itors’ committees. The court attempted to appoint a cross-section of similarly situated
creditors on each committee. In smaller bankruptcies, creditors may have little inter-
est in the committees. In the Campeau bankruptcy, the office of U.S. trustee Conrad
J. Morgenstern was flooded with bondholders who were interested in serving on the
committee.
Debtor’s Actions and Its Supervision
The debtor may continue to operate the business during the reorganization process. The
law requires that the debtor obtain the approval of the bankruptcy court before it takes
any extraordinary action that is not part of the normal business operations, such as
selling assets or property.
Technically, the supervision of the debtor is the responsibility of the judge and the
creditors. They may acquire resources, such as legal and accounting or other financial
expert assistance, to help them. Practically, neither the judge nor the creditors usually
have the resources or time to closely supervise the debtor. Even if the debtor does some-
thing that the creditors do not approve of, the debtor may be able to convince the judge
that some actions are necessary for the survival of the company; that is, if the court does
not allow the debtor to take these actions, the company may go under. Thus, the judge is
put in the difficult position of making this decision with limited information. If the judge
rules against the debtor and is wrong, he risks the company’s going out of business and
all the duress and employee suffering this might cause. For this reason, the debtor is usu-
ally granted significant leeway and will be opposed only when its proposed actions are
clearly objectionable.
Exclusivity Period
After the filing of the bankruptcy petition and the granting of the automatic stay, only
the debtor has the right to file a reorganization plan. This period, which is initially
120 days, is known as the exclusivity period. It is rare, however, particularly in larger
bankruptcies, to have the plan submitted during that time frame. It is common for
the debtor to ask for one or more extensions. Extensions are granted only for cause,
but they are not difficult to obtain. However, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
Consumer Protection Act of 2005 placed an absolute limit of 18 months on the
exclusivity period.

Reorganization Process

455
Obtaining Postpetition Credit
One of the problems a near-bankrupt company has is difficulty obtaining credit. If trade
creditors are concerned that a company may become bankrupt, they may cut off all
additional credit. For companies that are dependent on such credit to survive, this may
mean that a bankruptcy filing is accelerated. In fact, if a company may be on the verge
of bankruptcy, its vendors may decline to offer them normal credit terms and may insist
on cash on delivery. For example, this was the case in 2008 for Linens & Things, which
found it had to pay cash to vendors who normally offered them 30 to 60 days to pay.
When this happens, it elevates a company’s cash needs at a time when it is actually less
liquid than normal. This can accelerate the path to a bankruptcy filing.
Sometimes the bankruptcy of one company can create liquidity problems for other
companies. For example, when Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy in 1997, suppli-
ers became concerned about other companies and preemptively cut off shipments and
required cash payments.
To assist bankrupt companies in acquiring essential credit, the code has given post-
petition creditors an elevated priority in the bankruptcy process. This type of lending is
referred to as debtor-in-possession, or DIP, financing. DIP lenders have an elevated pri-
ority over prepetition claims. It is ironic that creditors may be unwilling to extend credit
unless the debtor files for bankruptcy so that the creditor can obtain the elevated priority.
A company that seeks such postbankruptcy financing has to file a motion with the
bankruptcy court seeking permission to do so. It is not unusual to see companies file
such motions at the time they do their Chapter 11 filing or shortly thereafter. Section
364 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that such loans have super-seniority status and
have a priority over other secured creditors. Thus, while creditors might not want to
lend to the company on an unsecured basis, the fact that the debtor-in-possession may
possess significant assets with a high collateral value, combined with the super-seniority
status, may give them confidence that their loans will be repaid. Various financial insti-
tutions specialize in DIP financing.
Credit Conditions and Length of Time in Bankruptcy
The management of cash-strapped companies that have significant assets that can be
used as collateral may find the reorganization process comfortable and not have incen-
tive to move the process along. Prepetition creditors, however, would have a different
view as they see the claims fall in value as new creditors’ interests are placed ahead of
theirs. In weak credit markets that process may work very differently. For example, in the
wake of the subprime crisis, credit availability declined sharply. This created more liquid-
ity issues for bankrupt companies—even those that had significant assets that normally
could be used as collateral. This, in turn, caused bankruptcy stays to become shorter
and for the increased use of prepackaged bankruptcies (discussed later in this chapter).
Asset Values and Length of Time in Bankruptcy
Companies that fall into bankruptcy are typically in weak financial condition, and
many are losing significant sums on a daily basis. This was the case in the Chrysler

456
◾
Restructuring in Bankruptcy
bankruptcy.15 Chrysler was reported to have been losing $100 million per day. Such
companies have been referred to as “melting ice cubes.”16 LoPucki and Doherty ana-
lyzed a sample of 30 “363 asset sales” (we will discuss Section 363 of the bankruptcy
code later in this chapter) and found out that 16 of them were companies that made a
melting ice cube argument to the court.17
Reorganization Plan
The reorganization plan, which is part of a larger document called the disclosure state-
ment, looks like a prospectus. For larger bankruptcies, it is a long document that contains
the plans for the turnaround of the company. The plan is submitted to all the creditors
and equityholders committees. The plan is approved when each class of creditor and
equityholder approves it. Approval is granted if one-half in number and two-thirds in
dollar amount of a given class approve the plan. Once the plan is approved, the dissenters
are bound by the details of the plan.
Sometimes, to avoid slowdowns that may be caused by lawsuits filed by dissatisfied
junior creditors, senior creditors may provide a monetary allocation to junior creditors.
This is sometimes referred to as gifting.
A confirmation hearing follows the attainment of the approval of the plan. A notice
of the hearing is published in publications like the Wall Street Journal. The hearing is
not intended to be a pro forma proceeding, even if the vote is unanimous. The presid-
ing judge must make a determination that the plan meets the standards set forth by the
Bankruptcy Code. After the plan is confirmed, the debtor is discharged of all prepetition
claims and other claims up to the date of the confirmation hearing. This does not mean
that the reorganized company is a debt-free entity. It simply means that it has new obli-
gations that are different from the prior obligations. Ideally, the postconfirmation capital
structure is one that will allow the company to remain sufficiently liquid to meet its new
obligations and generate a profit.
Cramdown
The plan may be made binding on all classes of security holders, even if they all do not
approve it. This is known as a cramdown. The judge may conduct a cramdown if at least
one class of creditors approves the plan and the “crammed down” class is not being
treated unfairly. In this context, unfairly means that no class with inferior claims in the
bankruptcy hierarchy is receiving compensation without the higher-up class being paid
100% of its claims. This order of claims is known as the absolute priority rule, which states
thatclaimsmustbesettledinfullbeforeanyjuniorclaimscanreceiveanycompensation.
The concept of a cramdown comes from the concern by lawmakers that a small
group of creditors could block the approval of a plan to the detriment of the majority of

the creditors.18 By giving the court the ability to cram down a plan, the law reduces the
potential for a holdout problem.
Fairness and Feasibility of the Plan
The reorganization plan must be both fair and feasible. Fairness refers to the satisfac-
tion of claims in order of priority, as discussed in the previous section. Feasibility refers to
the probability that the postconfirmation company has a reasonable chance of survival.
The plan must provide for certain essential features, such as adequate working capi-
tal and a reasonable capital structure that does not contain too much debt. Projected
revenues must be sufficient to adequately cover the fixed charges associated with the
postconfirmation liabilities and other operating expenses.
Partial Satisfaction of Prepetition Claims
The plan will provide a new capital structure that, it is hoped, will be one that the com-
pany can adequately service. This will typically feature payment of less than the full
amount that was due the claimholders. For example, in the classic bankruptcy of the
Penn Central Railroad, the bankruptcy process lasted eight years and produced a con-
firmed plan that gave holders of secured bonds 10% of their claims in cash. The cash was
generated by the sale of assets. The remaining 90% was satisfied by 30% each in new
mortgage bonds, preferred stock, and common stock. This provided Penn Central with a
lower amount of financial leverage because the secured bond debt was 10% discharged
by the cash payment, and 60% was converted to preferred and common equity.
BENEFITS OF THE CHAPTER 11 PROCESS FOR THE DEBTOR
The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides great benefits to debtors, some of which are listed in
Table 12.6. The debtor is left in charge of the business and allowed to operate relatively
free of close control. This has led some to be critical of what they perceive as a process
that overly favors the debtor at the expense of the creditors’ interests. The law, however,
seeks to rehabilitate the debtor so that it may become a viable business and a productive
member of the business community.
Company Size and Chapter 11 Beneﬁts
The fact that debtors enjoy unique benefits while operating under the protection of
the bankruptcy process is clear. Smaller companies, however, may not enjoy the same
benefits that the process bestows on larger counterparts. An older study by Turnaround
Management Associates showed that the probability of surviving the Chapter 11
process is directly related to the size of the company.19 Figure 12.4 shows that 69%

of the larger companies, those with revenues in excess of $100 million, survived the
process and were viable afterward, whereas only 30% of the smaller firms, those with
revenues under $25 million, were able to do so.
The reason for the size differential in survival rates is that larger companies are in a
better position to handle the additional unique demands placed on a Chapter 11 debtor.
For example, the bankruptcy process is very demanding on management time. Before
the bankruptcy, management presumably was devoting all its time to managing the
business, and the business still was not successful. Now management has to devote its
time to managing the business and dealing with the time demands that the bankruptcy
litigation imposes. This task may be more difficult for smaller companies, where man-
agement is not as deep as in larger firms.

Beneﬁts of the Chapter 11 Process for the Debtor
◾
459
Although the additional expenses of the bankruptcy process may be relatively small
compared with a larger company’s revenue base, such expenses may be an additional
burden that a smaller business cannot handle. For example, Lawrence A. Weiss reports
that direct costs average 3.1% of the book value of the debt, plus the market value of
the equity.20 Professional fees may be very high—particularly in larger bankruptcies.
For example, in the Johns Manville bankruptcy, professional fees were almost $200
million.21 For a small firm with a thin capitalization, percentages may be much higher
than the average reported by Weiss. For these reasons, Chapter 11 may be an excellent
choice for some large companies but may not be a good idea for smaller businesses.
Projections Done in Chapter 11
Before emerging from Chapter 11, a company is required to put forward certain finan-
cial and operational projections as part of its reorganization plan. These projections
include balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. Michel, Shaked,
and McHugh followed 35 Chapter 11 companies from 1989 to 1995.22 They found that
these projections were frequently overstated—sometimes significantly so. For example,
they found that actual sales generally lagged projected sales in the first year after emerg-
ing from Chapter 11. In some cases, the overstatement was as much as 20%.
MULTIPLE CHAPTER 11 FILINGS: LEVITZ
FURNITURE
T
he Chapter 11 bankruptcy process is one in which a company can seek to
address speciﬁc ﬂaws, such as burdensome debt levels and a ﬂawed capital
structure. Often, this is sufﬁcient to turn the company around and enable it to be
a viable business. However, sometimes the company simply has a ﬂawed business
model, and there are limitations to what can be accomplished through reorganiza-
tion. An example is Levitz Furniture, which in November 2007 ﬁled for Chapter 11
reorganization for the third time in a 10-year period. The company was a marketer
of less expensive and lower-quality furniture. It went public in 1968 and private in
an LBO in 1985, only to do a reverse LBO in 1993. Rather than use the going-public
proceeds to reduce debt, it used some of them to do acquisitions.
Levitz ﬁrst ﬁled Chapter 11 in September 1997. It then merged with Seaman’s
Furniture, which was a comparable company and which had itself ﬁled for bankruptcy
reorganization in the early 1990s. Combining two ill companies does not necessarily
create one healthy one. The expanded Levitz then emerged from Chapter 11 in

2001, which was a very weak economic period. It did not do well in the ensuing
years and had to ﬁle Chapter 11 again in 2005—a much better economic period.
It later emerged from Chapter 11, only to ﬁle for a third time in November 2007
as the economy started to weaken. This time, the company was liquidated and
its absence from the market created an expansion opportunity for competitors
such as Raymour and Flanigan. Levitz’s repeated visits to Chapter 11 are instructive
regarding the limits of Chapter 11 reorganization. Reorganization cannot correct a
ﬂawed business model, and sometimes it is simply better to liquidate the business
rather than have return visits to the bankruptcy court.
Post–Chapter 11 Performance
The Chapter 11 reorganization process is designed to transform the distressed company
into one that is financially viable. How successful is the reorganization process? Edith
Hotchkiss analyzed the postbankruptcy performance of a sample of 806 bankrupt com-
panies. Of these, 197 emerged from Chapter 11 as public companies while others experi-
enced “other outcomes,” such as emerging as a private company, merging with another
firm, or being liquidated.23 The results were not all that impressive.
Hotchkiss also found 40% of the firms experienced operating losses over the three
years following their Chapter 11 emergence. Roughly one-third either fell back into
bankruptcy or had to privately restructure their debt. Hotchkiss’s research shows that
many firms left Chapter 11 even though they were really not viable companies. The
bankruptcy process is designed to facilitate corporate rehabilitation, but perhaps it
contains a bias that overly favors the debtor in possession. The court is supposed to
approve Chapter 11 reorganization plans only if there is a reasonable basis to believe
that the reorganized company can be viable. Too often, though, this is not the case.
Maksimovic and Phillips analyzed the productivity of plants owned by companies
emerging from Chapter 11.24 They found that the plants retained by companies
after Chapter 11 had lower productivity as opposed to ones that were sold off. They
concluded that bankrupt companies had a tendency to retain their least productive
assets. However, this may be because the more productive assets were more marketable
and, if there is sufficient demand in the industry, and if the industry as a whole is not
depressed, then the better assets may be the more marketable ones. Companies that
need to increase their liquidity might need to sell off some of their better assets. This
does not bode well for the postbankruptcy performance.
Management and Postbankruptcy Performance

postbankruptcy performance and retaining prebankruptcy management. Retaining the
managersthathelpedleadthecompanyintobankruptcygreatlyincreasesthelikelihood
that the company will continue to do poorly. This is a lesson for creditors to keep in mind
when evaluating reorganization plans.
While the postbankruptcy managers often lead the company on to continued poor
performance, they often receive lower compensation for their managerial efforts. Gilson
and Vetsuypens analyzed the compensation of managers in 77 publicly traded firms that
filed for bankruptcy or privately restructured their debt over the period 1981–1987.25
Approximately one-third of the CEOs were replaced, and those managers who retained
their position often had to accept a substantial cut in their salary and bonus. When these
managers were replaced by internal hires, they were paid roughly one-third less. How-
ever, when the hire was an outside manager, they were paid approximately one-third
more, although a lot of their compensation was from stock options. Recruiting for a
bankrupt company is naturally a harder sell.
PREPACKAGED BANKRUPTCY
A new type of bankruptcy emerged in the late 1980s. By 1993, it accounted for one-fifth
of all distressed restructurings. During the 1990s, prepackaged bankruptcies accounted
for 9.2% of all bankruptcies, while in 2000 they equaled 6.8% of all bankruptcies in that
year. Table 12.7 shows some of the larger prepackaged bankruptcies.
In a prepackaged bankruptcy, the firm negotiates the reorganization plan with
its creditors before an actual Chapter 11 filing. Ideally, the debtor would like to have
solicited and received an understanding with the creditors that the plan would be
approved after the filing. In a prepackaged bankruptcy, the parties try to have the
terms of the reorganization plan approved in advance. This is different from the typical
Chapter 11 reorganization process, which may feature a time-consuming and expensive
plan development and approval process in which the terms and conditions of the plan
are agreed to only after a painstaking negotiation process.
The first major prepackaged bankruptcy was the Crystal Oil Company, an oil and
natural gas exploration company located in Louisiana.26 The total time between the
bankruptcyfilingin1986andthecompany’semergencewasonlythreemonths.During
this time, the company negotiated a new capital structure in which it reduced its total
indebtedness from $277 million to $129 million.27 As is typical of such debt restruc-
turings, the creditors received other securities, such as equity and convertible debt and
warrants, in exchange for the reduction in the original debt.
Beneﬁts of Prepackaged Bankruptcy
The completion of the bankruptcy process is usually dramatically shorter in a prepack-
aged bankruptcy than in the typical Chapter 11 process. Both time and financial

resources are saved. This is of great benefit to the distressed debtor, who would prefer
to conserve financial resources and spend as little time as possible in the suspended
Chapter 11 state.28 In addition, a prepackaged bankruptcy reduces the holdout problem
associated with voluntary nonbankruptcy agreements. In such agreements, the debtor
often needs to receive the approval of all the creditors. This is difficult when there are
many creditors, particularly many small creditors. One of the ways a voluntary agree-
ment is accomplished is to pay all the small creditors 100% of what they are owed and
pay the main creditors, who hold the bulk of the debt, an agreed-upon lower amount.
It was noted previously that approval of a Chapter 11 reorganization plan requires
creditors’ approval equal to one-half in number and two-thirds in dollar amount. With
the imminent threat of a Chapter 11 filing, creditors know that after the filing is made,
these voting percentages, as opposed to unanimity, will apply. Therefore, if the threat of a
Chapter 11 filing is real, the postbankruptcy voting threshold will become the operative
one during the prepackaged negotiation process.
Prevoted versus Postvoted Prepacks
The voting approval for the prepackaged bankruptcy may take place before or after
the plan is filed. In a prevoted prepack, the results of the voting process are filed with
the bankruptcy petition and reorganization plan. In a “postvoted prepack” the voting
process is overseen by the bankruptcy court after the Chapter 11 filing. In a study of
49 prepackaged bankruptcies, Tashjian, Lease, and McConnell found that prevoted
prepacks spend less time in bankruptcy court but devote more time to prefiling negoti-
ations.29 Prevoted prepacks also had lower direct costs as a fraction of assets and had
higher recovery rates for nonequity obligations.
Tax Advantages of Prepackaged Bankruptcy
A prepackaged bankruptcy may also provide tax benefits because net operating losses
are treated differently in a workout than in a bankruptcy. For example, if a company
enters into a voluntary negotiated agreement with debtholders whereby debtholders
exchange their debt for equity and the original equityholders now own less than 50%
of the company, the company may lose its right to claim net operating losses in its
tax filings. The forfeiture of these tax-loss carryforwards may have adverse future
cash flow consequences. In bankruptcy, however, if the court rules that the firm was
insolvent, as defined by a negative net asset value, the right to claim loss carryforwards
may be preserved. Betker estimates that the present value of future taxes saved by
restructuring through a prepackaged bankruptcy, as opposed to a workout, is equal to
3% of total assets.30
28 Critics of the Chapter 11 debtor benefits would disagree. They would contend that some Chapter 11 compa-
nies prefer the benefits that protection of the Bankruptcy Code gives them and try to exploit these advantages
over their creditors for as long as possible. Therefore, they are not in a hurry to leave the Chapter 11 protection.

Restructuring in Bankruptcy
If a debtor company reaches a voluntary agreement whereby creditors agree to
cancel a certain percentage of the debt—say, one-third—this amount is treated as
income for tax purposes, thus creating a tax liability. A similar debt restructuring in
bankruptcy, however, does not create such a tax liability.31
CIT GROUP INC.’S PREPACKAGED BANKRUPTCY
T
he November 1, 2009, bankruptcy of ﬁnancing company CIT was one of the
biggest corporate bankruptcies and was the largest prepackaged bankruptcy. It
also served as a model for how quickly the prepackaged bankruptcy process can
work. Most ﬁnancial ﬁrms do not survive the bankruptcy process and are either
merged into other companies or are liquidated. This was not the case with CIT.
After receiving overwhelming support from its bondholders, CIT emerged from
bankruptcy just 40 days after ﬁling. The postbankruptcy company came out with
a new capital structure that lowered its burdensome debt by $10.5 billion. These
bondholders agreed to exchange their debt for other debt with a later maturity and
almost all of the stock in the reorganized company.
CIT, a company founded in 1908, provides ﬁnancing, such as factoring, for a
variety of small and medium-sized businesses. When the subprime crisis took hold,
the company found its access to credit markets was cut off. It was given $2.3 billion
in ﬁnancial support from the government, but that was not enough to stave off
bankruptcy. The government (and taxpayers in particular) did not fare well in the
bankruptcy process since it was given preferred stock, which was wiped out in the
reorganization plan. The company also became a bank holding company, which is a
step other ﬁnancial institutions took to be able to get access to some of the sources
of liquidity that large banks have access to.
Like many other companies that have found themselves in bankruptcy, CIT’s
woes can be largely attributed to a failed acquisition/expansion strategy. CEO
Jeffrey Peek led the company to pursue a diversiﬁcation strategy into subprime
mortgages and student loan lending. He sought to move CIT into higher-return
businesses and followed the crowd into mortgages and student loans. For example,
he acquired Education Lending Group, a student loan consolidation company,
for a 24% premium. Proﬁts were more than $1 billion in 2006—well above their
2003 levels—when Peek joined the company. When the subprime market collapse
took hold in 2007, however, CIT posted a $111 million loss. This is yet another
example of a new CEO who was not content to manage the core business he
had taken over, commercial lending, and sought to diversify and move the ﬁrm
into higher return–higher risk areas. The diversiﬁcation strategy was also ﬂawed in
light of the fact that the company continued to rely on short-term ﬁnancing from
the commercial paper market but increasingly moved into longer-term lending.
Once the commercial paper market collapsed, one of CIT’s main sources of capital
dried up. The ﬁrm left its core competency and shareholders paid the price for this
strategic failure.
Ironically, in February 2010 the postbankruptcy CIT chose John Thain as its
CEO. This was interesting in light of Thain’s role as CEO of Merrill Lynch during

WORKOUTS
When a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, the creditors and the debtor have to
decideiftheycanworkoutaprivatesolutiontotheirproblemsorseekacourt-supervised
outcome. One of the impediments to a private solution is information asymmetry. Credi-
torsusuallyknowmuchlessaboutthedebtor’struefinancialconditionandabilitytopay
and restructure itself than the debtor. When these asymmetries are quite substantial in
the eyes of the creditors, they may prefer the formal court process.32 A workout refers to
a negotiated agreement between the debtors and their creditors outside the bankruptcy
process. The debtor may try to extend the payment terms, which is called extension, or
convince creditors to agree to accept a lesser amount than they are owed, which is called
composition. A workout differs from a prepackaged bankruptcy in that in a workout the
debtor either has already violated the terms of the debt agreements or is about to. In a
workout, the debtor tries to convince creditors that they would be financially better off
with the new terms of a workout agreement than with the terms of a formal bankruptcy.
Beneﬁts of Workouts
The main benefits of workouts are cost savings and flexibility.33 Workout agreements
generally cost less for both the debtor and the creditors in terms of the resources the par-
ticipants need to devote to the agreement process. In addition, participants in a workout
are not burdened by the rules and regulations of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
They are free to create their own rules as long as the parties agree to them. They also
avoid the public scrutiny, such as from opening accounting records to the public, that
occurs in a bankruptcy filing. Workouts may also help the debtor avoid any business
disruption and loss of employees and overall morale that might occur in a bankruptcy.
With these benefits come certain risks. The key risk is the holdout problem discussed
previously. If this problem cannot be circumvented, a bankruptcy filing may be the only
viable alternative.
Recognizing Better Workout Candidates
Depending on the particular financial circumstances of the company and the per-
sonal makeup of the parties involved, a negotiated private settlement outside the

Restructuring in Bankruptcy
bankruptcy process may or may not be possible. Gilson, John, and Lang analyzed 169
debt restructurings from 1978 to 1987 and found that a little over one-half of them
were able to successfully restructure their debt.34 The roughly 50–50 split between
those that could restructure their debt and those that had to file for bankruptcy was
also found by Franks and Tourous, who studied 161 companies that experienced debt
downgrades to CCC or below (S&P ratings).35
Gilson, John, and Lang found that the financially distressed firms that had a higher
percentage of their assets as intangible and that owed less of their debt to banks were
more likely to be able to restructure their liabilities. This is not surprising, as banks tend
to be less willing to accept reductions in principal payments, although they may be will-
ing to waive covenants.36 They also found that distressed firms that had more public
debt outstanding found the road to restructuring more challenging and less fruitful.
Gertner and Scharfstein discuss the various conflicts that can arise when there are
multiple creditors.37 This can be the case, for example, when there are a very large num-
ber of bondholders. Getting such a large group of public investors to agree on a specific
workout strategy may not be practical. This problem is compounded by the fact that the
Trustee Indenture Act of 1939, another of the various post–Great Depression securities
laws that were passed, requires that for changes in interest rates or principal amounts,
there must be unanimous approval of the security holders. If one or more groups of
bondholders agree to accept a lower rate or principal payment, holdouts may be able
to require that they receive the full original interest and principal payments. This may
then mean that the large group voluntarily agrees to accept less, while a small number of
holdouts get full payment. Chapter 11, with its ability to bind creditors to an agreement
upon attaining majority vote, was designed to be able to deal with the holdout problem.
Hotchkiss, John, Mooradian, and Thorburn have opined on the reasons for a decline
in the percentage of distressed firms that are able to successfully utilize out-of-court
restructurings.38 One of the reasons they cited was court decisions that made debt
restructurings outside of bankruptcy more difficult. In addition, they point to the rise
of prepackaged bankruptcy as an alternative that many distressed firms find more
appealing.
There is evidence that the market prefers workouts over a bankruptcy filing. Chat-
terjee, Dhillon, and Ramírez found that the stock returns of companies that announced
workouts were less negative than those of companies that went the Chapter 11 route.39

To understand this, however, one needs to consider that creditors, including bondhold-
ers, and stockholders may, at times, have very different interests. Stockholders may be
quite eager to see a debt restructuring, as that may lower their interest payments and/or
the total debt of the company. However, the world of Chapter 11 may not be that kind to
equityholders. Thus stockholders may be quite happy when creditors agree to steps that
may keep the company out of Chapter 11—especially when creditors “pick up the tab”
for this benefit they bestow on equityholders.
Evidence on the Role of Transactions Costs in Voluntary
Restructuring versus Chapter 11 Decision
Gilson analyzed 108 publicly traded companies between 1980 and 1989 that either
restructured their debt out of court (57 companies) or reorganized under Chapter 11
(51 companies).40 He found that the firms that attempt voluntary restructuring outside
Chapter 11 were less able to reduce their leverage compared with Chapter 11 firms. He
traced the problem to higher transactions costs of voluntary restructuring. Examples of
these costs include the credit holdout problem, which makes it difficult to get all credi-
torstoparticipateintheagreement.Thisproblemisgreaterforholdersofsmallerclaims,
who have an incentive to hold up transactions until they receive preferential treatment.
Although a small number of such creditors may not be as much of a problem, the sit-
uation becomes very difficult if there are numerous creditors with similar motivations.
Other difficulties of voluntary restructuring include the fact that creditors may be less
willing to exchange their debt for equity when managers of the company have a signif-
icant informational advantage over them. This disadvantage renders creditors less able
to assess the value of the equity they would receive in exchange for their debt claims. One
additional factor is that institutional holders of debt may simply prefer debt to equity and
may not want to voluntarily become an equityholder. These issues become moot when
the process moves into Chapter 11 and the position of the debtor improves.
Acquisitions of Companies in Bankruptcy
Bidders can sometimes find attractive acquisition opportunities in companies that are
in Chapter 11. The question arises, under what circumstances does an outright sale of
the debtor in possession in Chapter 11 create more value than the emergence of the firm
from Chapter 11 as a restructured company? There is compelling evidence that compa-
nies that are sold in bankruptcy sell at a significant discount compared to comparable
companies not in Chapter 11. For example, Hotchkiss and Mooradian analyzed a sample
of 55 transactions, of which 18 had multiple bidders, and found that bankruptcy targets
sold at a 45% discount compared to comparable, nonbankrupt company sales.41 Clearly,
for the buyers the acquisitions allowed them to acquire businesses at very good prices.
However, in their pursuit of an answer to whether sales in Chapter 11 create economic

value, they went on to follow the postacquisition performance of the acquired bankrupt
firms. They found that the postacquisition performance of the acquired firms was bet-
ter than the firms that emerged from Chapter 11. They traced these gains to costs and
headcount reductions. These postacquisition findings were also associated with posi-
tive and significant abnormal returns for the bidder around the time of the acquisition
announcement.42 Hotchkiss and Mooradian conclude that acquisitions of companies
in Chapter 11 tend to result in an economically efficient allocation of assets.
In light of the interesting findings, it is useful to probe further into the charac-
teristics of the Hotchkiss and Mooradian sample of bankrupt company sales. They
found that the size of the target was, on average, 25.8% of the size of the buyer as
measured by total assets and 30.2% in terms of sales. This is consistent with research
on acquisitions in general.43 In addition, like Clark and Ofek, Hotchkiss and Mooradian
found that acquirers of bankrupt firms were often in the same industry. This makes
sense as an acquisition of bankrupt companies seems risky, but among competitors
who know the industry and the target, you would expect buyers to know what they
are getting.
A later study by Meier and Servaes analyzed 21,849 acquisitions over the period
1982–2012.44 Of these, 428 were distressed acquisitions, which they defined as com-
panies that were in bankruptcy, being liquidated, or were undergoing a restructuring.
They found that returns to acquirers were approximately 2% higher when the target
was distressed. They find these acquirer returns come at the expense of target returns,
which are 5% lower when the target is distressed. Research using the same database
also showed that acquirers of distressed assets enjoy returns that are 2% higher than
non-distressed acquisitions.45 They also found that these gains were higher when the
industry had fewer firms and when it was in poor financial health.
Asset Sales during Chapter 11
In the post-subprime crisis era, the distinction between reorganization and liquidation
became somewhat less clear. Rather than see either a reorganization or a sale of the
entire company or a liquidation of the firm, we also see more sales of assets or divisions by
companies in bankruptcy.46 Many of these sales are not part of a reorganization process
but are what are known as Section 363 sales.
A company in Chapter 11 can sell assets, and even substantially all of its assets, via
one of two paths. One is through Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and the other
42 Once again, the ability of the market to often correctly anticipate a longer-term financial outcome continues

is as part of the reorganization plan. In order to do a Section 363 sale, the company must
first receive an offer and then take the bid to the court for its approval. While bankruptcy
courts do not enforce Revlon-like duties for these sales, they want to see some efforts by
the seller to get the best prices for the assets, such as through some marketing, not an
auction, process. A hearing is held, and the judge must formally approve the sale.
Purchasing assets through Section 363, court-approved sales has several benefits
for both buyers and sellers. It lowers the legal risks for the buyer, as creditors cannot
pursue the buyers with claims of fraudulent conveyance of assets. If the sale is through
a court-supervised auction, the seller’s proceeds may also be greater.
Hotchkiss and Mooradian found that about a third of the companies in their sam-
ple had multiple bidders. They also found a comparable presence of multiple bidders for
sales through reorganization. Research on discounts from nondistressed values for com-
panies in Chapter 11 yield similar findings as the research we discussed for asset sales
by distressed companies that had not filed Chapter 11.
In addition to the sale of the entire bankrupt company, such companies can try to
ease their cash flow pressures and reduce their debt burden through asset sales. Shleifer
and Vishny examined the factors that affected liquidation costs for firms in financial
distress.47 They found that sale prices of assets were lower when the entire industry was
in distress. When this is the case, other firms in the industry may not be in a position
to bid for the bankrupt firm’s assets, thus lowering the overall demand for them. If the
assets are more fungible, however, such as being useful to others outside the industry,
this may offset lower intra-industry demand.
Reorganization versus Going-Concern Sales
Companies involved in a bankruptcy have to determine whether a sale of the entire
company or an exit from bankruptcy as a reorganized business will yield the greatest
return. In fact, in 2002 Professors Baird and Rasmussen asserted that traditional reor-
ganizations were disappearing and were only relevant for certain very large firms.48
LoPucki and Doberty conducted an empirical study in which they compared returns
from going-concern sales and reorganizations over the period of 2000–2004.49 They
found that returns were significantly greater with reorganizations. Going-concern fire
sales generated reduced values due to a variety of reasons, including illiquidity of the
market. The values that are realized in going-concern sales are affected by the state
of the M&A market, with stronger markets bringing higher values. However, bankrupt
companies are at a significant disadvantage when trying to receive high values for their
companies. Reorganized companies get to try to realize values over an extended period
of time, as opposed to sales that occur so close to the recent failure of the company.

Restructuring in Bankruptcy
SUNBEAM: BANKRUPTCY FOLLOWING A FAILED
ACQUISITION PROGRAM
C
ompanies that pursue acquisitions that fail, especially those that incur signiﬁcant
debt to ﬁnance the deals, run the risk of going bankrupt. This is one of the
extreme penalties that the market imposes for a poor acquisition strategy. Such a
fate befell Sunbeam Corp. when it had to ﬁle for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
in the Southern District of New York in February 2001. The company, which marketed
Sunbeam appliances, First Alert smoke alarms, and Coleman camping gear, showed
negative net worth on its bankruptcy petition, listing assets of $2.96 billion and
liabilities of $3.2 billion. The company could not handle the burden of $2.5 billion
in debt that it had accumulated, partially from unsuccessful acquisitions.
One of the main sources of ﬁnancial pressure was a $1.7 billion bank loan
that the company had entered into in 1998 to ﬁnance three acquisitions. In these
deals, Sunbeam acquired the Coleman Company, maker of sleeping bags and other
camping equipment; Signature Brands, owner of the Mr. Coffee brand; and the First
Alert company. The disparate nature of these acquisitions should have presented
red ﬂags to investors. The loan was provided by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, First
Union Corp., and the Bank of America. It was then discovered that Sunbeam, led by
turnaround artist Albert Dunlop, known as “Chainsaw Al,” fresh from his turnaround
of the Scott Paper Company, inﬂated sales by overselling retailers goods they did
not want so as to increase short-term revenues.
Sunbeam emerged from Chapter 11 in 2002 as a closely held business under
the name American Household Inc. The company’s reorganization plan provided
for its debt to be converted into equity. American Household was itself acquired
in 2005 by the Rye, New York–based Jarden Corporation for $745.6 million in cash
plus the assumption of $100 million in debt.a
a Terry Brennan, “Sunbeam Files for Chapter 11,” Daily Deal, February 7, 2001, 2.
Companies that have been in bankruptcy have a different risk profile, and many
potential acquirers may want to avoid them. We have seen that takeover prices are often
maximized when there is an auction process. This is why such bankruptcy sales may
feature stalking horse bidders. These are bidders who come forward and make the first
bid. In doing so, they establish a floor value and get the bidding process going. Often such
stalking horse bidders receive protections in the form of compensation if they are outbid.
CORPORATE CONTROL AND DEFAULT
When a firm defaults, it typically loses control, which is passed to its creditors. Credi-
tors may then acquire seats on the defaulting firm’s board of directors and may even
require that there be a change in management. Creditors may also receive an owner-
ship position in the debtor in exchange for other consideration, such as a reduction
in the amount owed. Gilson analyzed a sample of 111 publicly held companies that

Liquidation
◾
471
experienced significant financial distress between 1979 and 1985.50 Of this sample,
61 filed for Chapter 11 and 50 restructured their debt privately. He found that banks
received an average of 36% of the distressed firm’s stock. Gilson found that only 46%
and 43% of the predistress directors and chief executive officers (CEOs), respectively,
remained in place two years later, when they had either emerged from bankruptcy or
reached a negotiated restructuring agreement. It is interesting that directors who resign
from distressed boards serve less often than other directors on other boards. As might be
expected, very few of the distressed firms were involved in acquisition-related activity
during this period.
Leveraged Buyouts and Bankruptcy Proceedings
If a company that has undergone an LBO files for Chapter 11 protection, pre-LBO cred-
itors may try to argue that the transaction was improper and that their potential losses
are a result of a deal that allowed shareholders to gain a premium while leaving the
firm with insufficient capital to meet its normal postdeal obligations. Creditors may seek
to recapture the distribution that the company made to shareholders, alleging that it
violated state corporation laws. Under Delaware law, for example, companies are pro-
hibited from repurchasing their shares if their capital is, or will be, impaired as a result
of the transaction. In addition to remedies under state law, the creditors may also try to
argue that the transaction was a fraudulent transfer of assets and in violation of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. The company may argue that the business was solvent after the deal
and at that time had a reasonable expectation of sufficient future cash flows. As support
for its position, it may produce a solvency opinion from a firm that analyzed the com-
pany’s financial condition at the time of the deal and attested to its solvency as well as
to the sufficiency of its cash flows.
LIQUIDATION
Liquidation is a distressed firm’s most drastic alternative, and it is usually pursued only
when voluntary agreement and reorganization cannot be successfully implemented. In
a liquidation, the company’s assets are sold and the proceeds are used to satisfy claims.
The sales are made pursuant to the regulations that are set forth under Chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code.
When a company files under Chapter 7 the court appoints a trustee to oversee the
sale of the company’s assets. The trustee may then hire a firm that specializes in such
liquidation sales.
The priority of satisfaction of claims is made pursuant to the absolute priority
rule, which sets forth the hierarchy of claimants who may receive payments from
the liquidation proceeds. This hierarchy assures that secured creditors get fully paid
prior to unsecured creditors receiving any proceeds. Preferred, and later common

Restructuring in Bankruptcy
shareholders get paid from any monies that may be left but often nothing is available
after paying creditors.
Deviations from the Absolute Priority Rule
Chapter 11 does not explicitly require that the absolute priority rule be followed. Cred-
itors sometimes willingly make concessions in exchange for benefits in the form of a
quicker bankruptcy process, which wastes fewer of the bankrupt company’s resources
on the process itself. For a number of years, deviations from the absolute priority rule had
begun to become more common. This led some to conclude that creditors were losing
control in favor of management and equityholders. However, some research indicates
that this trend may be reversing. Bharath, Panchapegesan, and Werner found signif-
icant differences in the frequency of absolute priority deviations when they compared
the 1980s with the 1990s and 2000s.51 In the 2000s, the frequency of deviation was
significantly lower than in prior years. They also highlighted the role of key employee
retention plans, in which creditors agree to provide bonuses for management for them to
stay and to work with them to move the bankruptcy process along.
Involuntary Bankruptcy Petitions
Sometimes creditors may try to initiate an involuntary bankruptcy filing under
Chapter 7. For example, a creditor may seek to have its obligations satisfied through the
sale of the debtor’s assets. Oftentimes, however, a debtor company is able to convince
the bankruptcy court to convert the case to a Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding. In
cases where the court is not convinced that the debtor will be an appropriate candidate
for reorganization, the court may deny the debtor’s request to seek reorganization.
INVESTING IN THE SECURITIES OF DISTRESSED COMPANIES
Investing in the securities of distressed companies may offer great profit potential, but
only if the buyer is willing to assume significant risks. Distressed securities are defined as
the bonds or stocks of companies that have defaulted on their debt obligations or have
filed for Chapter 11. The market for these securities grew significantly in the late 1980s
through the 1990s. In the early 1970s, it was uncommon to find quotes for the securi-
ties of bankrupt firms.52 This changed in the 1980s, when such quotes were common.
Investment firms dedicated to the distressed securities field began to actively manage
distressed securities portfolios.
Hedge funds have long focused on the distressed securities market for undervalued
opportunities. We have already seen how Eddie Lampert was able to use this market as
a way of conducting a major acquisition at an attractive price. The business is fraught
with risks, as securities holders could easily see their investment collapse if the debtor’s

business deteriorates and is liquidated. Holders of distressed securities try to use the
bankruptcy process to convert their discounted bonds and other debt into more valu-
able investments. They are often able to garner a significant equity stake in a reorganized
company that they hope will have a capital structure they can live with.
Returns on Distressed Debt Securities
Returns on distressed debt securities have a unique profile. Hradsky and Long found that
returns start to become negative approximately 18 months before default as the market
internalizes information on the weak condition of the issuer.53 These returns start to
turn sharply negative five months before default and bottom out at approximately −40%
around five months after default (Figure 12.5). If investors were to buy after default,
returns would equal 7.5% over the two-year postdefault period.
Altman created an index of defaulted debt securities covering the period January
1987 through July 1990.54 He found that while returns were highly variable, they had
an average annual rate of return over this period of 10%. This exceeded the high-yield
index return for the same period, which was equal to 6.7%. One must be careful drawing
long-term conclusions from this short analysis period. However, there is some evidence
to support the high-return but high-risk attributes of distressed debt securities.
Altman also analyzed the correlation of the returns on debt securities with those
on other major categories of investments. Portfolio theory shows that if there is a low
correlation between returns on distressed securities and other potential investment
portfolio components, these securities may provide diversification benefits. He found a

Control Opportunities Using Distressed Debt Securities
One of the typical changes that a reorganized company undergoes in the Chapter 11 pro-
cess is to have its capital structure altered, with some debt being replaced by equity and
some,possiblyall,prepetitionequitydisappearing.Debtholdersmaybecomeequityhold-
ers.Whenthesedebtsecuritiesbecomeapathtoequity,theyaresometimesreferredtoas
fulcrum securities. Buyers of distressed debt securities may actually be seeking to obtain
an equity stake in the distressed company when they purchase the debt securities. This
has helped fuel the market for claims trading. Investors in Chapter 11 companies may
buy the claims themselves or purchase components of the bankrupt company as the
firm seeks to finance its turnaround or fund its reorganization plan.
The more aggressive of these opportunistic investors are sometimes referred to as
bankruptcy sharks or vultures. They purchase the debt of bankrupt companies with a goal
of taking control of the company. The strategy may yield high returns to those who are
able to aggressively participate in the reorganization negotiation process to acquire the
desired control. Although the securities may be purchased relatively inexpensively, the
outcome of the negotiation process, which may be quite lengthy, is very uncertain. For
this reason, this type of takeover strategy is particularly risky.
Claims trading provides potential benefits not just for the vultures but also for credi-
torswhofindthemselveswithahigherriskinvestmentthanwhattheirriskprofilewould
prefer. For them, this can be a good exit strategy as they transfer the risk and potential
return to those investors who are better suited to deal with it.
Hotchkiss and Mooradian analyzed a sample of 288 firms that defaulted on public
debt.55 Of these, they narrowed their focus to 172 firms that were the targets of vulture
investors. They found that the vulture investors were very active in the distressed com-
panies. Approximately a quarter of the time they joined the board of directors, and a
little less than 10% of the time they became chairman or CEO. In 16% of the cases they
acquired control through the purchase of claims including bank debt. They found post-
bankruptcy performance improvements after the vulture investors joined the boards or
became CEO or chairman.
CAMPEAU BANKRUPTCY
I
n January 1988, Campeau Corporation launched a takeover of Federated Stores.
The company had a market value of $4.25 billion, with $2.93 billion being equity
and $1.33 billion being debt. The purchase price was double the market value of
the company ($8.17 billion). The deal was a highly leveraged transaction, with 97%
of the total value ﬁnanced by debt.

In the beginning of 1990, after two years of troubled operations in which
the company failed to reﬁnance its takeover debt and bridge loans through the
issuance of junk bonds, Campeau ﬁled for Chapter 11 reorganization. Campeau’s
management of Federated Stores was poor. Under Campeau’s reign, the company
suffered through a difﬁcult Christmas season in 1990, and was also affected by the
overall downturn in the economy as the country moved into a recession. In the
period between the acquisition and the bankruptcy ﬁling, EBITDA declined. The
board of directors took away all operating responsibility from Robert Campeau.
The company had excess inventories and had to lower prices in an effort to sell off
these inventories while paying down the debt.

Restructuring in Bankruptcy
(continued )
During bankruptcy, a management team composed of new CEO Allen Que-
strom, President James Zimmerman, and CFO Ronald Tysoe increased operating
efﬁciency and raised capital through asset sales while managing to keep most
of the management team of this large department store chain intact. They sold
off or closed unproﬁtable stores, streamlined operations, and remodeled stores
that needed improvement. Kaplan concluded that the Chapter 11 process worked
remarkably well.a The process was not costly in terms of a deterioration of value.
He compared the value of the postbankrupt company with the preacquisition
value. He measured the postbankruptcy value of Federated, net of bankruptcy costs
and inclusive of interim cash ﬂows earned during bankruptcy. As Table A shows, the
value of the company increased with the acquisition, from a preacquisition market
value of $4.25 billion to the $8.17 billion value Campeau paid. Using the preceding
deﬁnition of value, Kaplan computed a $7.81 billion value before an adjustment for
market ﬂuctuations. After taking into account market ﬂuctuations, he arrived at a
substantially higher value ($11.31 billion).
Kaplan’s analysis shows that a leveraged acquisition may increase value even if
the company proves not to have sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to service its debt. Campeau’s
inability to service its debt led to its Chapter 11 ﬁling. However, the Chapter 11
process did not result in a deterioration in value of the bankrupt company. Kaplan
did not imply that this is the rule. Rather, he used the Campeau Chapter 11 reor-
ganization to illustrate that if the process is handled correctly, Chapter 11 does not
necessarily result in a loss of company value.

Role of Vulture Investors and the Market for Control of Distressed
Firms
Hotchkiss and Mooradian analyzed the role of vulture investors in the governance of
288 firms that defaulted on their debt between 1980 and 1993.56 Contrary to the
reputation that such investors have, Hotchkiss and Mooradian’s research found that
theyhadapositiveeffectonthepostdebtoperatingperformance.Theyfoundthatpostre-
structuring operating performance is improved relative to the predefault level when
the vulture investor becomes CEO or in some way gains control of the company. They
attribute this improved performance to enhanced managerial discipline. It is interesting
that they also found that a greater percentage of vulture firms were reorganized under
Chapter 11 (70.3% for vulture firms versus 39% for nonvulture firms), indicating that
these investors seek the benefits of the Chapter 11 process more than management.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Corporate Governance
STRUCTURE OF CORPORATIONS AND THEIR GOVERNANCE
Corporations are one of three general forms of business organizations: sole propri-
etorships, partnerships, and corporations. Corporations trace their roots back many
centuries as a business form that was designed to encourage the investment of capital
into potentially risky ventures, such as oceangoing trade, that were subject to major
risks (e.g., bad weather or theft from pirates). Some of the earliest corporate charters
were the Muscovy Company in 1555, the Spanish Company in 1577, and the Dutch
East India Company in 1601.1
Corporations provide an incentive for shareholders to invest by limiting their expo-
sure to their investment in the entity. Normally the personal assets are shielded from
exposure to litigation. This is different from sole proprietorships and partnerships, where
the owners’ personal assets are at risk. However, in recent years alternatives to simple
partnerships have been formed that limit the exposure and liability of partners. The most
common form of business is the corporate form, and this percentage accounts for the
vast majority of the dollar value of businesses.
While limited liability is a benefit, shareholders in corporations face the problem
that they have to select others to represent their interests. This is usually done by an
election of a board of directors by shareholders. These directors in turn select managers
who run the company on a day-to-day basis (see Figure 13.1).

FIGURE 13.1
Flowchart: Management, directors, and shareholders.
Corporate Democracy
Corporate democracy is different from the democratic process that one learns about in
political science. Elections for directors are not commonly contested. Most of the time
shareholders, while the true owners of the company, have only two choices when they
receive their ballots for election of directors: Vote to approve the slate or throw away their
ballots and withhold their vote. Occasionally the withholding of votes has been used to
voice displeasure with the board and management. This was the case in March 2004
when a large percentage of Disney’s shareholders withheld their support of Michael Eis-
ner, CEO of Disney. This led to the eventual departure of the highly paid Eisner.
Directors get elected if they receive a plurality of shareholder votes as opposed to a
majority. That is, directors who receive the most votes win even if they could not garner
an actual majority. In fact, if the election is uncontested, a director is elected even if he
or she only received a few votes—as absurd as they may seem.
In recent years there has been a movement away from plurality voting system to
majority voting. Under such a system directors could get elected even if they won few
votesaslongastheygotmorethananyoneelse.Inrecentyearstwo-thirdsoftheS&P500
shifted from plurality voting to majority voting.2
Shareholder activists have pushed hard to force companies to move to majority vot-
ing and we have noted that many have done so. But how important a shift has this been?
Cai, Garner, and Walkling analyzed a sample of 481 adoptions of proposals to change to
majority voting. They had several interesting findings. Firstly, 81% of the proposals were
sponsored by labor unions. Secondly, while the firms experience positive returns around
the announcement of the proposals, the ultimate passage of the proposal did not yield
positive returns. This led them to conclude that maybe the issue was a “paper tiger.”
Shareholder Voting Approval by Bidders
Throughout this book we have discussed the problem of bidders doing questionable
M&As which do not benefit their shareholders. In the United States this problem is
2 C.H. Allen, “Study of Majority Voting in Director Elections,” study by law firm November, Neal, Gerber and
Eisenberger LLP, http://www.ngellaew.com/files/upload/majority study111207.pdf.

compounded by the fact that shareholder voting rights are limited to the election of
directors and approving certain corporate bylaw changes. Stock exchange rules, such
as those of the New York Stock Exchange, do provide for securing shareholder approval
of acquisitions which require the issuance of 20% or more of the bidder’s shares.
However, if a U.S. bidder’s management and board want to avoid shareholder approval,
they can do so by making sure they use all cash or at least less than 20% of its shares.
Hsieh and Wang analyzed a sample of 2,205 bids from 1995 through 2005.3
They found that deals done without shareholder approval had lower synergistic gains
and underperformed in the long run. These results imply that a shareholder approval
requirement could result in better deals for bidder shareholders.
Becht, Polo, and Rossi looked to international comparisons to shed further light
of the value of shareholder approval in M&As.4 In the United Kingdom, listing rules
require that for deals where the target is significant in size (25%) compared to the bidder,
called Class I transactions, bidder shareholder approval must be secured. In an analysis
of a large sample of UK transactions over the period 1992–2010, they found that
Class I transactions almost never fail to secure approval. This is because Class I deals
which seem to be attracting bidder shareholder opposition typically get withdrawn
before an actual shareholder vote. They further found that Class I transactions showed
8% announcement period returns compared to Class II deals, which do not require
approval and which showed announcement period losses. Once again, this research
supports the notion that shareholder approval of significant deals, regardless of whether
they are paid for by stock or cash, benefit bidder shareholders.
Changes in U.S. Regulatory Governance
In light of the various large corporate frauds, including Enron, WorldCom, and too many
others, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 was passed. This law required CEOs and CFOs
to certify that they were not aware of any material misrepresentations in a public com-
pany’s financial statements. If this were found to be the case, they could be subject to
criminal penalties. The law also worked to eliminate conflicts that could occur between
accounting firms that were doing audit work but also trying to benefit from other con-
sulting income from the same corporate client. The law also required that the audit
committee of the board only contains independent directors. It also limited the ability
of a company to give personal loans to executives or directors.
In 2010, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act of 2010 enhanced the position of
shareholders by giving them a non-binding vote on the appropriateness of the compen-
sation of senior executives. It also mandated better disclosure of all direct and indirect
compensation of senior executives, including golden parachute payments and clawback
policies. This is a more important issue in the United States as it is commonly believed

that U.S. senior managements tend to be paid significantly more than their counterparts
in other nations. However, there is evidence to show that this may not really be the case.5
International Corporate Governance
The system of corporate governance varies greatly from country-to-country. We will
highlight the corporate governance systems of a few of the major national economies.
Of these Great Britain is most similar to the United States.
Great Britain
As we have pointed out in Chapter 3, securities regulation in Great Britain focuses on
enhanced shareholder rights. The same is true for how Great Britain treats corporate
governance. Both nations emphasize detailed disclosure in financial reporting for public
companies. In the UK, this is done through a combination of limited formal securities
laws passed by Parliament and various industry recommendations put forward by
the accounting and securities professions that have become industry standards.
An example is the Cadbury report of 1992, which made various recommendations
including separating the roles of the CEO and the chairman of the board, and requiring
independent directors as well as requirements for board committees such as having the
audit committee composed only of independent directors.
Germany
AcrosstheNorthSeatotheleadingeconomyinContinentalEurope,Germany,corporate
governance is treated very differently. One main difference is the prominent role non-
shareholder stakeholders are given. Germany has a dual board structure in which there
is a management board that makes decisions about company operations. Above the
management board, though, is a supervisory board which is composed entirely of non-
management members. This board approves the financial statements and all major cor-
porate control decisions such as M&As. Germany’s Corporate Governance Code further
requires that representatives of labor have one-third of the seats on this board. In Ger-
many, bank loans provide more capital to German companies than their counterparts
in the United States, so it is not surprising to see that banks often have representatives
on the boards of companies which have lent significant capital to the company.
Russia
Corporate governance is not strong in Russia—to say the least. In general, the legal
system has a long way to go. External investors have limited rights and experience has
showed that those rights can disappear quickly through a variety of creative maneu-
vers.6 Insiders and management dominate Russian public companies. Clearly these

problems have limited Russia’s access to international capital and have impeded the
economic growth of the nation although it has certainly enhanced the personal wealth
of a limited number of Russians.
Japan
As we move from Europe to the large economies of Asia we see very different corpo-
rate governance systems. Japan has long maintained stakeholder-driven system which
derives its basis from the many corporate interrelationships that exist in that country.
Under a system that is referred to as keiretsu, it is common to see public companies with
stakeholders that include other companies, such as suppliers, with whom they do busi-
ness. This system, which in the postwar years helped Japan recover from the devastation
ofitseconomywroughtbythewarthenationstarted,lefttheeconomyinflexibleandless
able to deal with needed corporate restructuring. As a result, the country fell into what
has virtually been a two-decade recession.
In 2002 Japan began to adopt corporate governance reforms and moved to a system
that was more similar to the shareholders-rights system of governance in the United
States.ThesereformshaveopenedthedoortoattacksonJapanesecompaniesbyactivists
and in response Japanese public corporations have adopted some takeover defenses such
as poison pills. The battles for corporate control, though, are really in their infancy and
cannot be compared to the United States. Normally, that might not be a bad thing but
for an economy that has lacked the ability to restructure itself, more external pressures
would be helpful.
Korea
The history of the growth of Korea’s economy has certain similarities to that of Japan.
Just like Japan’s economy that rebounded after World War II through a system of inter-
relationships between Japanese companies, Korea did the same after the Korean war.
At that time, Korean companies sought to work together, with governmental support, to
rebuild the war-ravished Korean economy. In Korea, these corporate interrelationships
are referred to as chaebols. This system of interrelationships allowed Korea to grow to be
a major international powerhouse in many industries such as ship building, electronics,
and automobiles. However, just like in Japan, the system worked for a while but limited
shareholder rights. Corporate managers relied on financing from the government and
this naturally facilitated close relations between corporate executives and high govern-
ment officials.
In Korea, like in continental Europe, founding family members tended to have high
voting power compared to public shareholders. As a result, public shareholders had lim-
ited ability to question management, Management in turn also did not have to go to
capital markets for financing as much as U.S. companies as Korean public companies
have typically relied on bank loans and government support. This resulted in a system
where the large companies can survive, if not thrive, even when they are not efficient.
Instead of being as efficient as they can be, one of the key attributes of such companies
is their ability to garner support from the government.

482
◾
Corporate Governance
When the economy was rocked by the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s,
many of these companies that were linked together suffered and fell into bankruptcy.
Many of the same problems that occurred in the late 1990s are to some extent present
today as underscored by the recent scandal and impeachment involving President Park
Geun-hye.
Korea adopted new corporate governance rules in 1999 which required that large
companies have at least half of their boards as outside directors while for smaller firms
this percentage was 25%. Black and Kim found that this change produced significant
share price increases for large firms and lesser increases for small companies.7
India
In the world’s second most populous nation, India, the nation has yet to fully embrace
a free market system in spite of having a very pro-business Prime Minister—Narendra
Modi. The nation adopted a voluntary corporate governance code in the late 1990s
and in 2006 other corporate governance reforms, grouped under “Clause 49,” were
implemented. These reforms moved the country closer to the U.S. system of corporate
governance. For example, a minimum number of independent directors are required
and, like in the U.S. after Sarbanes Oxley, the CEO and CFO have to certify that the
financial statements are accurate. Also, financial relationships between directors and
the company are limited.
The new corporate governance reforms are an important step in the right direction
for India. However, many large public companies are dominated by family members,
who wield the most control.8 Thus, other public shareholders are limited in their
ability to challenge a company’s policies they oppose. In addition, there are other
limitations in India on shareholding by foreign investors. This combined with the
overall inefficient nature of Indian capital markets limits the ability of market forces to
change inefficient public companies. Thus, the improvement in corporate governance
does not readily translate into more efficient operations of public companies in India.
China
While China has come a long way in its movement toward a freer economic system,
more progress is needed in its public securities markets. The pervasive influence of the
government in the control and operations of public companies remains significant.
Public companies in China have different types of shares they issue and those available
to foreigners have more limited rights. For example, tradeable A shares are only
available to domestic investors and trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges
and are denominated in renminbi. Foreign investors can purchase and trade B shares
which are denominated in U.S. or Hong Kong dollars, and also trade on the same two

exchanges. Foreign investors also have the option of buying H shares, which trade on
the Hong Kong exchange.
The Company Law of China, which was revised in 2005, sets forth the fiduciary
responsibilities of directors and “supervisors.” Chinese public companies have a board
of directors which tends to be management dominated, and a board of supervisors,
composed of non-managers and non-directors, who oversee the directors and senior
management.
While the revised version of the Company Law improved corporate governance in
China, the reality is that for most large Chinese companies, public shareholders typi-
cally own a relatively small percent of the shares and have very limited voting power.
The government is still the “big player” in Chinese public markets and this system has
not shown meaningful signs of changing. The government in China has other goals it
considers more important, including the continuing development of the overall econ-
omy and the standard of living of the Chinese peoples, Thus the interests of investors,
especially foreign investors, rank far lower (if at all) on their scale of priorities.
Conyon and He examined executive pay and corporate governance in China.9 They
found that executive pay in state-controlled firms was lower than non-state-controlled
companies. They also showed that firms with more outside directors had better linkages
between pay and performance. Such firms were more likely to replace the CEO follow-
ing poor performance. Private, non-state-controlled companies were also more likely to
replace the CEO after a poor showing.
In the United States, directors are usually listed alphabetically. In China, their listing
often shows how much power they have on the board. Independent directors are usually
listed last. Zhu, Ye, Ticker, and Chan showed that when independent directors are listed
higher up in the hierarchy, such firms have enhanced value.10 They also showed that
with higher ranking, independent directors were more likely to fire the CEO.
In this chapter, we discuss the movement of companies in the West to more
independent directors and how this movement may better enable them to monitor
management. In China, a shareholder with 1% of more of the outstanding shares can
nominate a director. In fact, data suggest that a majority of the directors of public
companies in China were nominated by shareholders. Liu, Miletov, Wei, and Yangh
analyzed a large sample of almost 17,000 firm years and 2,057 unique firms over the
years 1999–2012.11 They found that the movement to independent directors was
associated with positive stock performance—especially formerly state-controlled firms.
They also found, as would be expected, that the presence of independent directors
limited insider trading and made investment decisions more efficient. Other research
by Chen also found clear benefits of more outsiders on Chinese boards.12

Corporate Governance
Brazil
Before leaving the discussion of international corporate governance it is useful to focus
briefly on the nation that not that long ago was the darling of the emerging market
countries—Brazil.
Brazilian companies tend to have two classes of shares—those with voting rights
and those without them. Many of these non-voting shares are preferred stock.
Many Brazilian companies have thrived by having close relations with the govern-
ment and receiving governmental support such as in the form of preferential loans. The
recent political turmoil in Brazil, coming after the collapse of global commodity prices,
has left the company in a deep recession.
The leading stock exchange in Brazil, the Sao Paolo Stock Exchange, known as
Bovespa, has three different types of listings for public companies. Nivel 1 has the
least stringent requirements and Nivel 2 is somewhat more rigorous. However, Novo
Mercado places the more stringent demands on the issuing company. Shares that are
issued must have voting rights and boards of directors must have at least 20% of their
boards as independent directors. Companies must file financial reports that are created
in accordance with GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
While these changes are a step in the right direction, the recent bribery scandals that
have toppled the government show that Brazil has a long way to go with its corporate
governance.
Corporate Governance, Firm Value, and Returns: Using G and E
Indices
It is intuitive to believe that companies that exhibit better corporate governance realize
a gain in their market value compared to companies that lack such a system. However,
overtheyearssomecompanieshaveinstitutedvariousrestrictionsonshareholderrights
partly in response to the increases in hostile takeovers and proxy fights that occurred
starting in the fourth merger wave of the 1980s. Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick devel-
oped a governance index (G), which is a simple measure that assigns one point for each
provision that a company adopts which limits shareholder rights.13 They identified a
total of 24 provisions which they grouped into five categories: those that delay hostile
bidders (Delay), those that affect shareholder voting rights (Voting), protections pro-
vided to directors and officers (Protection), other takeover defenses (Other), and state
laws (State). Within each category there are various specific provisions. For example,
with Delay there are five specific provisions such as having a classified board and four
others.
Gompers et al. then grouped the companies with the poorest corporate governance
system into a “dictatorship portfolio” and the ones with the best into a “democracy
portfolio.” Over the period 1990–1999 the democracy portfolio outperformed the dic-
tatorship portfolio by 8.5% per year! This research provides empirical support for the

notion that shareholders are better off with better corporate governance. We will come
back to this study later in the chapter.
Bebchuk, Cohen, and Ferrell created a more focused index, the E index, which nar-
rowed down the number of provisions considered to six: staggered boards, limitations of
shareholder bylaw amendments, poison pills, golden parachutes, supermajority provi-
sions mergers, and for charter amendments.14 Only two of the provisions, poison pills
and golden parachutes, related to the voting power of shareholders.
They found a monotonic relationship between the magnitude of this index and
reduction in firm value, as measured by Tobin’s Q, and negative abnormal returns.
They interpret their research to conclude that the six provisions they focus on, of the
24 studied by Gompers et al., were what was driving the Gompers et al. results and that
the others were merely “noise.”
Cremers and Ferrell used the G Index to show how the weaker shareholders’ rights,
as measured by changes in the index, and the related declines in firm values were greater
after the landmark Unocal and Moran legal decisions in 1985.15 These decisions shifted
power to corporate boards. In their analysis, which covered the years 1978–2006, the
negative association only appeared after 1985. They also found that it was greater for
companies in industries that had more M&A activity.
Other research also shows that the passing governance-related shareholder propos-
als resulted in positive abnormal returns of 1.3% around the day of the vote.16 They
noticed greater positive effects when the companies had more antitakeover provisions.
Interestingly, they also found that the passage of such proposals was also associated with
fewer acquisitions and firm valuation increases over the long run.
WhiletheGompersetal.studyfoundthatcompanieswithstrongshareholderrights
had higher (8.5%) risk-adjusted returns and that firms with weak governance underper-
formed the market, they did not find that the weak governance group also had weaker
operating performance as reflected by accounting measures of shareholder equity. This
was puzzling. However, Core, Guay, and Rusticus analyzed a large sample of over ten
thousand firm years during the 1990s.17 Using the return on assets as their perfor-
mance measure they did indeed find that weak governance firms were associated with
poorer operating performance.
Early Corporate Governance Activists
In Chapter 7 we discussed the rising role of hedge fund activists. However, it is useful to
look back and recall that some of the early activists were funds like the California Public

Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and TIAA. These large pension funds arrived
at the belief that if the companies in their portfolio had better corporate governance,
their stock price performance would be better and this would uplift the fund’s returns.
Some funds, such as CalPERS, went so far as to create a list of companies that needed to
improve their governance. In 2010 CalPERS dropped its “name-and-shame” Focus List
but still actively engaged with underperforming companies in its portfolio.
The list clearly had value. However, a study by Wilshire Associates seemed to
support private contacts as opposed to the public shaming approach. Wilshire followed
155 companies over the years 1999–2008 and found that the 96 companies that
were privately contacted outperformed the 59 companies that were on the Focus List.
An updated study by Wilshire examined the performance of companies engaged by
CalPERS over the period 1999–2012.18 Wilshire found that in the three years prior
to being engaged by CalPERS, the engaged companies trailed the Russell 1000 by an
average of 38% and also trailed the Russell sector indices by 35%. However, in the first
five years after the engagement date these companies exceeded the Russell 1000 by
13.7% and their sector Russell indices by 13.7% and 12.1%, respectively.
Agency Costs
In smaller companies, shareholders may also choose the managers of the company. In
this case, there is less of a concern that the managers will take actions that are not
in the best interests of shareholders. In large companies, however, shareholders hold
a relatively small percentage of the total shares outstanding. When shareholders own a
portfolio of assets, with their equity positions in any given company constituting a rel-
atively small percentage of their total assets, they do not have a big incentive to oversee
the operations of the company. In addition, even if they wanted to, as the shareholders’
percentage of total shares outstanding declines, shareholders have less ability to influ-
ence the operations of the company—even if they wanted to devote time to doing so.
For this reason, shareholders must trust that managers will really run the business in
a manner that maximizes shareholder wealth. One of the concerns that shareholders
have is that managers will pursue their own personal goals and will not run the com-
pany in a manner that will maximize shareholder wealth. If managers do pursue policies
that shareholders oppose, their relatively small shareholdings often do not allow them
to take actions to effectively oppose management. Shareholders have to put their trust
in the board of directors and hope that they will look after their collective interests when
they monitor management. This is the essence of the board’s fiduciary duties. When
directors are insufficiently diligent and do not require managers to act in shareholders’
interests, they violate their fiduciary duties.
The topic of agency costs was popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet it is ironic that
it remains in the forefront as we go through the 2000s. This seems to be a function of
human nature and the inability of some to put their ethical obligations ahead of their
own personal ambitions. A directorship is not a full-time position, and directors pursue

other work, including possibly serving on other boards. One survey of directors reported
that on average there were 5.6 board meetings per year and that they devoted an average
of19hourspermonthtoboardissues.19 Thechallengeofboardmembersistomakesure
that the time they allocate to monitoring managers is sufficient to allow them to ensure
that management runs the company in a way that maximizes shareholder wealth.
Since directors are not generally monitoring the company on a daily basis, they use
periodic updates from management and monitor their performance as reflected in var-
ious financial statements, such as quarterly reports. Even with such reporting, there
is opportunity for the managers, the agents of the shareholders, to pursue their own
self-interest at the expense of shareholders. When this occurs, the owners of the com-
pany are said to incur agency costs. Shareholders will never be able to eliminate agency
costs, and they will always exist at some level. The goal is to limit them to some mini-
mal or acceptable level. One of the solutions that has been used to try to control agency
costs is to create incentives for managers to act in the interests of shareholders. This is
sometimes done by giving management shares or stock options that would enable them
to profit when shareholder values increase, thereby aligning the interests of both man-
agers and shareholders.20 For a while, option grants were touted as the solution to the
agency costs problem. However, with the various highly publicized accounting scandals
of the late 1990s and 2000s, many have questioned the large offerings of stock options.
Option grants are given by the board with the details of the grant being handled by the
board’s compensation committee. At some companies there have been questions about
the timing of the option grants, which sometimes come too close to upward movements
in the stock price to be coincidental. In addition, some companies have given option
grant recipients the right to select the date when options are granted. Normally options
do not vest for a period of time, such as a year or more, and have an exercise price of the
closing stock price on the day the grant is given. Therefore, the date that the options are
officially granted can make a big difference in their value. This whole issue has come
under increased scrutiny in recent years.
The granting of some of the CEO’s compensation in the form of options has the effect
of extending CEO compensation duration. Gopalan, Milbourn, Song, and Thakor analyzed
a large sample of stock and option grants to CEO over the period 2006–2009.21 They
treated compensation in a manner that is analogous to duration of fixed income secu-
rities. They found that firms with greater growth opportunities, higher R&D intensity,
and better past stock performance had greater CEO compensation duration.
Dual Classiﬁcations and Agency Costs
In Chapter 5 we discussed how dual classifications can concentrate shareholder voting
power in the hands of certain parties such as insiders. In an analysis of a large sample of
503 dual-class companies over the period 1995–2003, Masulis, Wang, and Xie found

that shareholder wealth declines as the divergence between insider voting rights and
cash flow rights increases.22 In addition, as this divergence increases, CEO compensa-
tion rises and the propensity to pursue value-destroying M&As grows. Their research
confirmed the intuitive result that dual classifications increase agency costs. In recent
years, dual classifications have become a more controversial issue with many tech com-
panies going public with dual stock structures which preserved the control by the former
private company owners.
CEO Compensation and Agency Costs
The median compensation of the CEOs in the Equilar 200 list was $16.9 million in 2016,
which was up 9% from the prior year.23 However, at the extreme upper end is Charter
Communications’CEO,ThomasRutledge,whomtheWallStreetJournalreportedin2016
at $98 million—up from $16.4 million in 2015. His company, however, experienced a
42% rate of return. He also may have been rewarded for the takeover of competitor Time
Warner Cable.
Other high-earning CEOs, such as Oracle’s Mark Hurd (formerly CEO of HP), earned
$41.1 million, yet his company earned a negative −6% stock return and declining com-
pany revenues.24 Robert Iger of Disney received $41 million yet his company earned
an 8% stock return. It is amazing that such performance is so highly compensated by
boards. It is no wonder many believe that corporate governance in the United States has
a long way to go.
One key question is, in general, do the high-paid U.S. CEOs really generate value for
shareholders? Boards have tried to incentivize CEOs by giving them more of their com-
pensation in the form of equity incentives. However, a recent study by MSCI indicates
that this may not “do the trick.”25 They analyzed a sample of 429 large-cap U.S. compa-
nies over the period 2006–2015. They found on a 10-year cumulative basis, companies
that paid the lowest quintile “total summary pay” (the pay amount that is disclosed in
proxy statements) earned significantly higher returns than those that paid the highest
quintile level (see Figure 13.2).
Some have criticized the MSCI results by pointing out that the bulk of CEO pay is
long-term incentives such as equity incentives. The ultimate value realized is often dif-
ferent than the amount that is included in Total Summary Pay, which includes the grant
date value of long-term incentives—not the ex-post realized values. A survey by Tow-
ers Watson did find a better relationship between executive realized compensation and
shareholder returns as the value of the realized equity incentives would naturally be
related to the realized shareholder return.26

International CEO Pay Comparisons
The compensation of U.S. CEOs seems particularly high when compared with their
counterparts in Europe and Asia. The difference in these compensation levels can be
readily seen in data compiled by the Hay Group in a study commissioned by the Wall
Street Journal, which shows that in 2013 the median CEO compensation at 300 large
U.S. companies was approximately $11.4 million, of which two-thirds was a function
of performance.27 The large percentage of the total that incentive pay accounts for can
be a concern, as it is often not fully transparent. In fact, some argue that this lack of
transparency may be by design in an effort to disguise upper management extracting
unjustified gains or “rents” from shareholders.28
According to the Institute for Policy Studies, senior executives of European compa-
nies earned only about a third of what their U.S. counterparts earned.29 Another survey
by Towers Perrin (now Towers Watson) found that the average U.S. CEO earned about
twice as much as his or her British counterpart.30 Part of the reason for this is that cor-
porate reforms were adopted in Britain that required that shareholders vote annually
on executive compensation. When we consider that institutional investors wield signif-
icant power at some British corporations, it is not hard to understand why executive
compensation seems under better control in that nation.

Corporate Governance
U.S. economy is the richest in the world still does not explain these large compensation
differences, as the gap in the CEO compensation is far in excess of the relative differences
in the size of the economies. Moreover, although a larger economy may have more large
corporations than a smaller economy, other reasons must be found for the fact that at
comparably sized companies across different countries, the U.S. CEO earns a far greater
compensation. Given that U.S. CEOs have become accustomed to earning the highest
compensation in the world by international standards, U.S. shareholders have a right
to expect superior performance in exchange. Indeed, if it could be shown that U.S. CEOs
generated increased shareholder value commensurate with their higher compensation
level, shareholders would not have cause to complain. It is only when the value of their
investmentdoesnotbenefitfromthehighpaythattheygivetheirCEOsthatshareholders
have reason to be upset.
CEO Compensation and Shareholder Returns
When determining CEO compensation, one obvious question that arises is, Do com-
panies that pay their CEOs more generate greater return for their shareholders? If
the answer is yes, then maybe the CEOs are worth their higher compensation. Recent
research, however, fails to find support for this assertion. In analyzing a large sample
of the firms included in the S&P Execucomp database covering the period 1994–2006,
Cooper, Gulen, and Rau found that firms in the highest decile ranking of executive
compensation earned significant negative excess returns!31 In fact, their results showed
that for each dollar that was paid to CEOs their shareholders lost $100. They also found
that these higher-paying firms generated stock returns that trailed their peers by over
12 percentage points!
Other research has come to a similar conclusion but approaches the problem
differently. Bebchuk, Cremers, and Peyer looked at the “CEO slice”—the percentage of
total compensation of the top five managers in companies that goes to the CEO.32 In
analyzing a sample of more than 2,000 companies, they found that the CEO pay slice,
which was approximately 35%, was negatively related to firm value as reflected by
industry-adjusted Tobin q values.
Management Perks, Agency Costs, and Firm Value
Management perks have clear direct costs that are measurable, but there is some
evidence that indicates that such expenses may have costs well beyond these direct
costs. A study by Yermack looked at certain high-profile perks, such as use of corporate
aircraft, and showed that companies that disclosed such managerial perks tended to
underperform annual market benchmarks by 4%.33 His study analyzed 237 large
corporations over the years 1993–2002. The magnitude of the aggregate dollar

underperformance was significantly greater than the actual monetary costs of the
specific perks. One explanation is that the market takes the revelation of the perks as an
indication of corporate waste and management that may not be running the company
in a manner that will maximize shareholder value. Clearly, for large corporations, cor-
porate aircraft may be more efficient than scheduled airlines. It is unlikely that investors
disagree. However, they are concerned not with necessary corporate transportation but
with signs that might be indicative of symptomatic waste and a lack of concern about
management’s fiduciary obligations.
CEO Compensation and Firm Size
Over the period 1980–2003 CEO compensation increased sixfold. Gabaix and Landier
analyzed CEO pay at large companies over the period 1970–2003. They found that the
primary determinant of CEO pay was firm size as measured by market capitalization.34
Their research showed that market capitalization was a statistically significant inde-
pendent variable while other size measures, such as revenues and net earnings, were
not. This implies that CEOs are able to use the growth in the market value of the com-
pany’s shares as leverage to extract increases in their compensation from the board and
the company. It also raises M&A-related concerns as it shows a clear, and quite intu-
itive, motive for CEOs to engage in empire building deals which can then translate into
increased compensation for them.
CEO Compensation and Board Characteristics
If U.S. shareholders often do not receive sufficient benefits from the higher compensa-
tion they pay their CEOs, then this raises questions regarding how effective the corporate
governance process is in controlling the financial benefits that CEOs seem to be extract-
ing from the company without a comparable gain for shareholders. A study by Core,
Holthausen, and Larker provides some insight into the relationship between CEO com-
pensation and the makeup of boards.35 They examined 205 large corporations over a
three-year period in 14 different industries. They related the different levels of CEO com-
pensation to different characteristics of boards.
In their analysis, Core et al. assumed that larger boards were less effective and
more susceptible to CEO influence.36 This conclusion is intuitive, as at a larger board
each director constitutes a smaller percentage of the total board and commands a
smaller percentage of the total votes needed to approve board decisions. Additionally,
Core et al. also looked at the percentage of outside directors on boards as well as the
number of “gray” directors. These were directors who receive other compensation or
benefits beyond the director payment that directors receive for serving on the board.

Corporate Governance
In addition, the study’s authors also assumed that if the director was appointed to the
board after the CEO was in place, then the CEO played a role in that decision. Their
analysis also highlighted interlocked directors, as those directors may be weaker from a
corporate governance perspective (interlocked boards will be discussed in greater detail
later in this chapter). They also assigned a negative value to CEOs being older (over 70)
and being on too many other boards.
Core et al.’s findings are consistent with human nature. Their research showed an
inverse relationship between CEO compensation and the percentage of outside directors
on the board. They also found that CEO compensation was positively related to board
size as well as to the number of members of the board who were appointed by the CEO.
CEO compensation was also greater for the directors who were gray, over age 69,
or who served on three or more boards. There was also an inverse relationship between
CEO compensation and the size of the shareholdings of the CEO. In addition, they found
that CEO compensation was lower when there were external blockholders who owned
5% or more of the outstanding shares. These external blockholders had sufficient power
to try to keep the CEO’s pursuit of higher personal compensation in check. The lower the
size of the holdings of the largest shareholders, the less likely they would have the power,
or the incentive, to hold the CEO in check. Earlier in this book we saw the important role
large blockholders can play in preventing value-reducing deals.
CEO Compensation and Peer Group Benchmarking
CEO compensation is usually determined by a subcommittee of the board of directors.
Often this is done by selecting a peer group of CEOs of companies that in the committee’s
view are sufficiently comparable to be included in the comparison. Recent SEC proxy
disclosure rules require that the peer group be disclosed. Research by Bizjak, Lemmon,
and Nguyen provides support for the contention that the peer group is opportunistically
selected to derive a higher compensation level for the CEO.37 Their research shows that
S&P500 companies appear to select peers that are similar or smaller than their com-
pany in an apparent effort to justify the compensation of the CEO, whereas non–S&P
500 companies appear to select peers that are larger in an apparent effort to support
higher compensation levels.
One may wonder who is selecting the peer group? This is usually done by the com-
pensation committee of the board, which may retain a compensation consulting firm.
Two of the leaders in this field are Mercer and Towers Watson. These consultants will
often put together what they consider to be a peer group and will put forward statistics
on compensation for these peer firms. Critics allege that there is an upward bias in their
selection process.38
Another factor that needs to be considered is an effort by boards to try to hire
above-average CEOs who then may logically command above-average compensation.
However, if most firms pursue this practice, we end up with an upward spiral of
compensation levels with the lower half of the distribution continually being adjusted to

be consistent with levels in the upper half.39 It is interesting to note that insofar as this
practice may be prevalent in the United States, there is less evidence that it is pursued
in Europe, where there seems to be more concern about keeping upper management
compensation at controlled levels.
CEO Compensation, Incentives, and the Role of Luck
In response to concerns that guaranteeing CEO compensation would not provide
sufficient incentives to guarantee good performance and shareholder returns, boards
have developed more incentive-based compensation, such as stock options. For a while
this seemed to address the incentive problem, but then the backdating-of-options
scandal called that solution into question.40 Research has shown that companies that
are better governed charge CEOs more for their options than those that lack such
good governance.41 In addition, when incentives are based on factors that are heavily
influenced by luck, such as when profits at oil companies rise as a function of the higher
price of oil rather than good management, the compensation system is questionable.
Research has shown that better-governed firms reduce the role of luck. Bertrand and
Mullainathan showed that when the equity base includes a large shareholder, pay for
luck is much less.42 Smaller boards also reduce the role of luck in CEO compensation.
Nonetheless, problems such as pay asymmetry, where CEOs may get increased pay for
lucky outcomes but still retain their positions and not lose as much for unlucky results,
persist even for companies that may possess relatively good governance.43
Superstar CEOs: Are They Worth It?
Manylargecorporationshavesoughtout“superstarCEOs”towhomtheygivehighcom-
pensation. Malmendier and Tate analyzed the performance of CEOs who were awarded
this status in the form of relatively high compensation, awards, and press coverage.44
They found such CEOs underperform compared to their prior performance as well as
the performance of their peers. Their compensation rose significantly on attainment
of the superstar status, but their performance declined. In fact, they showed that such
CEOs spent a disproportionate amount of time doing other activities, such as attend-
ing public and private events as well as writing books—work from which the company
may derive little benefit. Their peers who may not have had as many of these opportuni-
ties presumably devoted more of their time to running the company, which may explain
why they outperformed the superstars. One of the lessons of this research is that hiring

a superstar and paying the high pricetag may not be in the company’s best interest. The
company may be better served by hiring an executive who will work smart and hard for
good but not outlandish pay.
CEO SEVERANCE PAYMENTS
Boards are not just generous with shareholder money when it comes to paying takeover
premiums; they are generally generous when it comes to paying CEOs with other
people’s—shareholders’—money. Some CEOs have received huge payouts following
the sale of their companies. For example, in 2005, James Kilts, CEO of Gillette, received
$165 million following the sale of his company to Procter & Gamble Co. Another
example was the $102 million that Bruce Hammonds was reported to have received in
connection with MBNA’s acquisition by Bank of America, and the $92 million that Pete
Correll was reported to have received in connection with the 2005 sale of his company,
Georgia Pacific, to Koch Industries. Even companies known for poor performance still
have similar payouts for their CEOs when they are finally sold. For example, AT&T CEO
David Dorman is reported to have received $55 million in connection with the sale of
his company to SBC Communications.
Goldman and Huang conducted an empirical analysis of every CEO who left his
position in an S&P500 company over the years 1993 to 2007.45 They measured the
excess severance pay for departing CEOs and defined excess as the amount beyond
what the company contractually agreed to pay as severance in the CEO employment
contract. As shocking as it sounds, excess CEO pay was an average of $8 million,
which was over 240% of the CEO’s annual compensation. They found that for the
CEO who left voluntarily, weak corporate governance was positively associated with
the size of the excess severance pay. This is no surprise. For CEOs who were forced out,
however, they believed the data showed that a desire to protect shareholders’ interests
and preserve an orderly transition was a more important explanatory factor than
weak governance.
MANAGERIAL COMPENSATION, MERGERS, AND TAKEOVERS
Managers often personally gain from M&As. That is, many CEOs and other senior
management have employment agreements that provide them with large payouts upon
changes of control. We will discuss these golden parachute agreements a little later in
this chapter. The issue is important due to the pivotal role that a target CEO may play in
negotiating his or her own postmerger position and compensation. This issue has been
the subject of some interesting research. Hartzell, Ofek, and Yermack analyzed 311
primarily friendly transactions over the period 1995–1997.46 They found that target
CEOs enjoyed mean wealth increases between $8 million and $11 million. The bulk of

CEO Compensation and Power

these financial gains came from increases in stock and options as well as from golden
parachute payments. Some CEOs even receive last-minute increases in their golden
parachute agreements—presumably in exchange for promoting the deal. They also
found that about one-half of the CEOs became officers in the buying entity, although
their departure rates over the three years following the merger were very high. Even for
these exits, however, the former target CEO received enhanced compensation.
The Hartzell et al. study also showed that, in deals where target CEOs enjoyed
extraordinary personal treatment, shareholders received lower acquisition premiums.
This creates the disquieting concern that target CEOs are trading premium for their
shareholders in exchange for their own personal enrichment.
While managers may use the negotiating process for takeovers as a means to
increase their own wealth, the threat of a future takeover may also play a role in
limiting CEO compensation. Managers who extract excessive benefits from their own
companies or who pursue a strategy that enriches themselves, as opposed to sharehold-
ers, may create an opportunity for an outside bidder to acquire the company in a hostile
takeover and correct this inefficiency. Agrawal and Knoeber examined a sample of 450
corporations and looked at the compensation of their CEOs.47 They divided their sample
into two subgroups, where the CEO either was or was not protected by an employment
agreement or golden parachute that would provide him with protection from removal
by a hostile bidder. The bidder could remove the CEO following an acquisition, but the
CEO’s short-term compensation might not be affected that much. Their results showed
what they referred to as a competition effect. This occurs when managers receive lower
compensation when there is a greater threat of takeover. They also found what they
termed a risk effect—that managers tend to demand more compensation when they are
employed by companies that are more likely to be takeover targets.
CEO COMPENSATION AND POWER
Common sense tells us that if CEOs have greater power, many will use it to increase their
own compensation. Research seems to support this assumption. One study by Cyert,
Kang, and Kumar considered a sample of 1,648 small and large companies. The average
CEO in their study was 55 years of age, and had served in that position for an average of
eight years.48 They found that in 70% of the cases the CEO was also the board chairman.
In addition, they noted that equity ownership of the largest shareholder and the board
was negatively correlated with CEO compensation. This is consistent with the findings
of the Core, Holthausen, and Larcker study, wherein they noted that CEO compensa-
tion was lower when there were large equity blockholders.49 Interestingly, Cyert et al.

Corporate Governance
CEO compensation under control than the size of the board or the percentage of outside
directors. When board members have their own capital at risk, they seem to do a better
job of monitoring the CEO and reviewing how much of the potential profits of the busi-
ness the CEO extracts in the form of compensation. Once again, these findings are quite
intuitive.
There is another force that can help keep CEOs in check and that is the takeover
market. Bertrand and Mullainathan found that when a company is allowed to install
antitakeover defenses that insulate the company from takeovers, CEO compensation
tends to be higher.50 Therefore, there are both internal and external forces that monitor
the CEO and ensure that he runs the company in a manner consistent with sharehold-
ers’ goals. The process is far from perfect, but research seems to imply that it often works
in a somewhat satisfactory manner, although it can benefit from improvement.
CEO Power, Governance, and M&As
Can powerful CEOs be adequately checked by good corporate governance from making
poor acquisitions? Oler, Olson, and Skousen analyzed a sample of 300 (reduced to 271)
randomly selected Fortune 1000 companies over the period 1998–2004 with the goal
of shedding light on this issue.51 They used the E Index to measure corporate gover-
nance and used various measures of CEO power which were suggested by Finkelstein.52
Examples of these measures are CEO tenure, CEO’s educational background, other direc-
torships, as well as whether the CEO is also the chair of the board. They found that
corporate governance does not appear to determine whether a CEO will engage in M&As.
However, it does seem to influence the types of deals the CEO does. That is, they found
that the better the governance, the more likely the deals would be related as opposed to
diversifying M&As.
Say-on-Pay
Say-on-pay refers to shareholders having the opportunity to vote for or against
the compensation of the CEO. Such a vote is more than just a vote on the specific
compensation package of the CEO. In effect, it is also a referendum by shareholders
as to whether the CEO is worth the compensation at issue. Cai and Walking found
that in many instances the market response to say-on-pay initiatives was not always
positive—especially for labor union–sponsored initiatives.53 In addition, they noted
that activist-sponsored say-on-pay proposals often do not target companies that
could benefit from them—those with excessive CEO pay, poor performance, and bad
governance.

Cunat, Gine, and Guadalouple show many positive effects of say-on-pay propos-
als.54 They found that firms that adopt these proposals show long-term improvements in
profitability and productivity. Their passage was also associated with positive abnormal
returns.
CEO Overconﬁdence and Takeovers
In Chapter 4 we discussed the hubris hypothesis and how hubris-filled executives have
a greater tendency to pay higher takeover premiums. Malmendier and Tate analyzed
the role of CEO overconfidence in the tendency for CEOs to engage in M&As.55 They
measured CEO overconfidence, using factors such as the tendency for CEOs to hold
options in their company’s stock until their expiration, thereby exhibiting bullishness
about the company’s prospects and their ability to create stock gains. In analyzing a
sample of large companies covering the period 1980–1994, they found that overcon-
fident CEOs were more likely to conduct acquisitions and, in particular, more likely to
pursue value-destroying deals. As part of this value-destruction process they found
that overconfident CEOs were more likely to pursue diversifying deals, which abundant
research has shown tends to destroy value for acquiring company shareholders. They
also do not find that the relationship between overconfidence and acquisitiveness varies
with CEO tenure, implying that for overconfident CEOs it is a function of their position
and their personal hubris.
Are Overconﬁdent CEOs Good for Anything?
There is convincing research support for the notion that overconfidence can lead to
value-destroying M&As. This gives rise to a question: Are overconfident CEOs good for
anything? The answer may be yes. Hirshleifer, Low, and Teoh analyzed a large sample
of 2,577 CEOs covering 9,807 firm years drawn from the time period 1993 to 2003.56
They found that overconfident CEOs are more likely to pursue risky projects and, in gen-
eral, are better innovators. They tend to invest more in research and development and
their companies tend to apply for and receive more patents. In addition, the returns of
their companies tend to be more volatile. So for risk-seeking investors, overconfident
CEOs may be “just the ticket.”
CEO Age and M&A Probabilities
Given that many workers retire in their 60s, the question arises, does having a CEO in
that age bracket affect the probability that the company will merge with or be sold to

that optimal investment decisions suggest that CEOs should sell their options prior to expiration, as failing to
do so would result in their assuming too much company-specific risk.

another firm. Jenter and Lewellen analyzed a sample of thousands of takeover bids over
the period 1989 to 2007.57 They found that the likelihood of receiving a takeover bid is
distinctly higher when the CEO is close to age 65. This is consistent with the hypothe-
sis that as workers reach their mid-60s they seek to retire. We know that it is common
that CEOs of target firms are not retained after the acquisition. Interestingly, Jenter and
Lewellen did not find a significant difference in takeover premiums for younger versus
older CEOs.
HEWLETT-PACKARD–COMPAQ MERGER:
SHAREHOLDERS LOSE, CEOs GAIN
I
n February 2005, the board of Hewlett-Packard (HP) announced that it had ter-
minated the employment of its colorful CEO, Carly Fiorina. Fiorina, formerly of
AT&T and Lucent, had orchestrated the $25 billion stock-ﬁnanced merger between
Compaq and HP in September 2001. This merger was strongly opposed by leading
shareholders, such as Walter Hewlett, son of the company’s founder. Fiorina barely
won shareholder approval of the deal. When we look back on the merger, we see
that the concerns of the market and opposing shareholders were well founded. The
gains that she projected when the operations of the rival computer makers were
combined never materialized. While revenues at HP rose steadily over her tenure,
proﬁtability had been weak. Fiorina caused the company to move even more deeply
into the PC business, which it had not been able to manage proﬁtably, unlike its
rival Dell.
She was not content to focus on HP’s more successful business segments, such
as printers. Instead she expanded into areas where it would command a larger
market share—but not make a meaningful contribution to shareholder value. In
merging with Compaq, HP was adding a company that had similar troubles. Compaq
itself was the product of a prior merger between Compaq and Digital Equipment.
However, the PC business is very unusual in that it exists in a deﬂationary market,
with industry competitors often having to reduce prices of their products while their
costs are rising. This is a very difﬁcult environment in which to be successful. It is
noteworthy that the founder of the PC, IBM, sold its PC business in 2005 to Chinese
computer manufacturer Lenovo.
The acquisitive Fiorina was replaced by Mark Hurd, who immediately changed
the focus at HP from doing megadeals to being a lower-cost company and empha-
sizing the company’s strength in areas such as printers. It is too early to tell how
successful this very reasonable strategy is, but early results show promise. Hurd
separated the printer and PC businesses and focused on dealing with the PC unit’s
problems. He has cut costs and managed to purchase components, such as chips,
cheaper by playing chipmakers AMD and Intel against each other. He has also
developed better relationships with retailers, while Dell has started to suffer from
its lack of a retail distribution system.
It is ironic that while shareholders suffered under Fiorina’s reign, she proﬁted
handsomely from her ﬁve-year stint at the company. At the time of her dismissal,
it was estimated that she would enjoy a severance package in excess of $20
million. In addition, Michael Capellas, the former CEO of Compaq, who served

as president of the postmerger HP, received in excess of $15 million when he left,
even though he was with the combined entity for only a relatively short period. The
merger was the most signiﬁcant action that Fiorina orchestrated at HP, and it was
a clear failure. When CEOs receive great rewards for eroding shareholder value,
there are few incentives for them to pursue different strategies. One solution would
be to tie CEO compensation to the achievement of speciﬁc targets. If a CEO very
aggressively pushes a major merger in which the success is predicated on the
achievement of certain measurable performance targets, then let the board agree
only if the CEO’s compensation and bonuses are also tied to the achievement of
those targets. This should be particularly true for deals that face strong opposition,
as this one did. If the CEO does not agree to performance-based compensation
tied to such major corporate gambles, then maybe the likelihood of these goals
being achieved is questionable.
After some major acquisition blunders, such as the acquisitions of EDS and
Autonomy, HP ﬁnally decided to undo the empire different CEOs, such as Ms.
Fiorina, had assembled. In 2014 CEO Meg Whitman decided to break the company
in two parts. Certainly, the old HP has had an acquisition history no company can
be proud of.
GOLDEN PARACHUTES
Golden parachutes are special compensation agreements that the company provides to
upper management. The word golden is used because of the lucrative compensation
that executives covered by these agreements receive. Although companies typically
maintain that they adopt such agreements for reasons other than the prevention of
takeovers, they may have some antitakeover effects. These effects may occur whether
the parachutes are used in a preventative or an active manner. They may be used
in advance of a hostile bid to make the target less desirable, but they may also be
used in the midst of a takeover battle. It should be kept in mind, particularly for large
takeovers, that the golden parachute payments are a small percentage of the total
purchase price. This implies that the antitakeover effects of these benefits may be
relatively small. Many CEOs of corporations believe that golden parachutes are a vital
course of action in a takeover contest. One problem corporations face during a takeover
battle is that of retaining management employees. When a takeover has been made, a
corporation’s management is often besieged by calls from recruiters. Managers who
are insecure about their positions are quick to consider other attractive offers. Without
a golden parachute agreement, the managers might be forced to litigate to realize
certain compensation in the event that they were terminated following a change
in control. Therefore, some corporations adopt golden parachutes to alleviate their
employees’ concerns about job security. Jensen contended that properly constructed
golden parachutes should result in management possessing sufficient incentives to
negotiate higher takeover premiums for shareholders.58 On the other hand, the ability
of target managers to negotiate their own special arrangements at the posttakeover

company while at the same time negotiating the acquisition price may present an
inherent conflict that may mitigate some of the positive effects of golden parachutes.
The legality of golden parachutes has been challenged by shareholders who see
them as a giveaway of their assets. In general, these challenges have not been successful.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Golden Parachute Agreements
A study by Lambert and Larcker provides some support for Jensen’s view. They
found that stock prices rose 3% when companies announced the adoption of golden
parachutes.59 Other studies have provided a basis for the market’s positive stock price
response. In a sample of 146 firms that adopted golden parachutes between 1975 and
1988, Machlin, Choe, and Miles found that the number of multiple takeover offers was
significantly greater for firms that possessed golden parachute agreements than for
those firms without such agreements.60 They also found a positive relationship between
the size of the golden parachute agreement and the magnitude of the takeover premium.
Other research has showed negative shareholder wealth effects following the adoption
of golden parachute agreements, but these results were not statistically significant.61
Some studies find that the shareholder wealth effects of golden parachutes are
dependent on when they are adopted. Hall has found that the effects are negative if they
are adopted when a firm is in play but are neutral when that is not the case.62 Some
studies show that the adoption of golden parachutes increases the likelihood that the
company will be a takeover target.63 However, Schnitzer has shown that this effect is
less likely when the management team is efficient.64
More recent research by Bebchuk, Cohen, and Wang found that golden parachutes
were associated with decreased shareholder wealth around the announcement of the
adoption of the golden parachute.65 However, for firms that are taken over, they are
associated with higher expected premiums.
Mechanics of Golden Parachutes
A typical golden parachute agreement provides for lump-sum payments to cer-
tain senior management on either voluntary or involuntary termination of their
employment. This agreement is usually effective if termination occurs within one year

Compensation Characteristics of Boards

after the change in control. The agreements between the employee and the corporation
may have a fixed term or may be an evergreen agreement, in which the term is one
year but is automatically extended for an additional year if there is not a change in
control during a given year. Monies to fund golden parachutes are sometimes put aside
in separate accounts referred to as rabbi trusts. Rabbi trusts provide assurance to the
employee that the monies will be there for the payment of the parachutes.
The amount of compensation is usually determined by the employee’s annual com-
pensation and years of service. For example, the agreement could provide for the termi-
nated employee to receive some multiple of a recent year’s annual salary, possibly also
including incentive and bonuses, for a certain number of years.
Golden parachutes are usually triggered by some predetermined ownership of stock
by an outside entity. Lambert and Larcker found that the trigger control percentage of
stocks acquired by a bidder was an average 26.6% for the firms they studied.66 How-
ever, some corporations have control trigger percentages below 10%—well below the
Lambert and Larker sample average. Lambert and Larker also showed that the partici-
pants in golden parachute plans are narrowly defined. In their sample, golden parachute
agreements covered only 9.7% of the executives. These agreements are extended to exec-
utives who do not have employment contracts. They are effective even if the managers
leave the corporations voluntarily after a change in control.
Golden parachutes are not usually applied broadly. One unusual exception is what
are known as silver parachutes, compensation agreements given to most employees in
the firm, including lower-level employees. The most common type of silver parachute is
a one-year severance pay agreement.
Single versus Golden Trigger Parachutes
Golden parachutes can be single trigger or double trigger. A single trigger parachute kicks
in when there is a change in control. A double trigger parachute is one where there has
to be both a change in control and a termination to be effective. Single trigger parachutes
have been criticized as the parachute itself was designed to help employees who may lose
their job after their company is acquired. However, they can provide the employee with a
windfall if the company is acquired and they choose to voluntarily leave. This may even
create an incentive for the employees to bring about a change in control that may not be
in shareholders’ interests. This has led to the replacement of single trigger parachutes
with double trigger ones or none at all.
COMPENSATION CHARACTERISTICS OF BOARDS THAT ARE
MORE LIKELY TO KEEP AGENCY COSTS IN CHECK
We can use the findings of the Core et al. study to highlight some of the characteristics
of boards that will be in a better position to keep agency costs in control. These charac-
teristics are as follows:

These desirable board characteristics are supported by other research beyond the
Core et al. study. In the following section we will focus on specific board characteristics in
greater detail and look at other research that sheds light on their impact on shareholder
wealth.
ROLE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The board of directors is charged with the role of monitoring management, and the CEO
in particular, to try to ensure that the company is run in a manner that will maximize
shareholder wealth. We have discussed how sometimes CEOs are able to pursue a strat-
egy that facilitates their own personal goals, which may not be consistent with those of
shareholders. We will now explore the role of the board of directors and why the board’s
oversight process may not always function properly.
Multiple Board Appointments and Busy Directors
It is not unusual for a director of one corporation to sit on the boards of one or more other
companies. Such directors are referred to as “busy directors.” Being asked to serve on
multiple boards can be construed to be a sign of a good reputation. However, being on
too many boards may cause the director to be spread too thin and the oversight may
suffer as a result. Fich and Shivdasani have shown that companies that have over half of
the outside directors sitting on three or more boards have lower financial performance as
reflected by lower market-to-book ratios and weaker corporate governance in general.67
While it is an intuitive conclusion, this result has been contradicted by other research
that failed to find such lower market-to-book ratios.68 However, research has shown that
when CEOs receive excessive compensation, their boards are more likely to have busy
outside directors.69
Interlocking Boards
In an interlocked board, directors sit on each other’s boards. In one variant of this,
the CEO of one company may sit on the board of another firm that has its CEO sitting

Role of the Board of Directors

on his board. One can only imagine that this cozy situation will not result in closer
CEO oversight. Once again, this is what one would expect based on human nature.
This expectation is supported by research findings, such as those of Hallock, who
analyzed a dataset of 9,804 director seats covering 7,519 individuals and 700 large
U.S. companies.70 He found that 20% of the companies in his sample were interlocked.
He defined interlocked to be where any current or retired employee of one company
sat on another company’s board where the same situation was the case for the other
company. He found that approximately 8% of CEOs are reciprocally interlocked with
another CEO.
In addition to quantifying the frequency of interlocked boards, Hallock’s study also
provided other interesting results. He noted that in his sample, interlocked companies
tended to be larger than noninterlocked firms. In addition, CEOs of interlocked compa-
nies tended to earn significantly higher compensation. This implies that CEOs stand to
gain when their boards are interlocked. In his study he controlled for firm characteris-
tics, such as firm size, and found that pay gap could not account for all of the difference.
Other research has shown that interlocked boards are less likely to occur when
more of a CEO’s compensation comes from stock options as opposed to salary. They are
also less likely when boards are more active and meet more frequently. Research seems
to show that interlocking boards are not desirable. CEOs are highly sought after as
directors. Fahlenbrach, Low, and Stulz analyzed 26,231 board appointments at 5,400
firms over the period 1989–2002 in an effort to discern why CEOs are so in demand
as directors.71 They found some positive stock responses to appointments of CEO as
outside directors—especially to the appointment of the first CEO to come on the board.
However, they failed to find any significant effects of these appointments on company
performance or even on corporate decision making, including CEO compensation and
decisions on M&A strategy.
Independence of Directors
Boards have two groups of directors: inside and outside board members. Inside board
members are also management employees of the company. These board members may
include the CEO, as well as certain other senior members of management whose input
may be useful in board deliberations. The trend in recent years has been to have more
independent directors on the board. As of 2016, 85% of the board members of S&P500
firms were independent.72
Research findings provide convincing support for the belief that the more outside
directors are on the board, the more likely the board will make decisions that are in
shareholders’ interests. This body of research also indicates that shareholders will
realize greater gains if their companies are taken over when their boards contain more

outside directors.73 Another study by Rosenstein and Wyatt noted that stock prices
of companies tend to increase when an outside director is added to a board.74 The
market has indicated a clear preference for outside control of the board, and it usually
is concerned when boards fall under the control of management.
It is reasonable to conclude that boards in which insiders have limited influence
will be able to make tough decisions involving managers and their performance. Such
boards are more likely to be able to make a change in upper management when cur-
rent managers fail to generate the performance that shareholders may be expecting.
When decisive action is needed and where the performance of management needs to be
criticallyreviewed,outsideboardswillbeinabetterpositiontoimplementsuchanobjec-
tive review. However, we have to understand that there are good reasons why boards
have certain managers on them. These management board members can provide useful
insight into the performance of the company that other, outside directors may lack.
However, we would not want a board composed solely of such directors. Indeed, much
can be said for a mixed board composed not just of insider and outside directors but
also of outside directors of diverse backgrounds who can bring a wide range of exper-
tise and experience to the management monitoring process. Outsiders, and especially
some prominent outside directors, can play a key role when action such as removal of
an incumbent CEO is needed.
A study by Weisbach showed that boards with a greater percentage of outside
directors were more likely to discipline their CEO for performing poorly than those
where insiders played a more prominent role.75 Inside-dominated boards may simply
be too close to the CEO and may be reluctant to make decisions that may have adverse
effects on their comanagers. Outside board member directors are often less close to
the CEO and can react more objectively. However, exceptions to this are interlocking
directorships that may have outsiders with reciprocal relationships on each other’s
boards. These interlocking board members should not be considered in the same light
as other outside directors.
Splitting CEO and Chairperson Positions
In the United States it is not unusual to see that the CEO is also the chairperson of the
board. This is very different from the United Kingdom, where this practice is much
less common. This has given rise to concern in the United States that when the CEO is
also the chairperson there are insufficient checks and balances, as the CEO may also
dominate the board. In response to these concerns, more companies have split the two
positions. Research from Russell Reynolds Associates showed that as of 2011, 44% of
the S&P500 have separate individuals in the CEO and chair positions.76 This was a

significant increase over the percentage from 2001, which was 21%. The percentage is
higher for NASDAQ companies, which was 65% in 2011. While these percentages have
risen they are still well below those which prevail in Europe. For example, 90% of the
FTSE100 companies have these positions separated.
Board Size
Over the years boards have gotten smaller. In its 34th Annual Survey of Boards of
Directors, the Korn Ferry Institute found that the average board consists of 10 directors
compared to 1973, the first year of their board survey, when one-fifth of the boards
had between 16 and 25 directors.77 For S&P500 companies the average board size
was 10.8 members.78
The size of a board plays an important role in how effectively it may oversee manage-
ment. In a larger board, each board member may wield less influence, and this may shift
the balance of power to the CEO in a way that may reduce shareholder wealth. There is
evidence to support this proposition, but the relationship between board size and firm
value is not that simple.
Yermack attempted to determine if there was a relationship between the mar-
ket valuation of companies and board size. He analyzed a sample of 452 large U.S.
corporations over the period 1984–1991. The average board size for his sample was
12 directors.79 Yermack found that there was an inverse relationship between market
value, as measured by Tobin’s q, and the size of the board of directors (see Figure 13.3).
Smaller boards were associated with higher market values, and larger boards tended to
be associated with lower valuations. The higher valuations often come from relatively
smaller boards that have fewer than 10 members. He also looked at other performance
measures, such as operating efficiency and profitability measures, and found that
they were also inversely associated with board size. He also found that smaller boards
were more likely to replace a CEO following a period of poor performance. In addition,
Yermack found some evidence that CEO compensation was more closely linked to
performance, especially poor performance, when boards are smaller. Based on these
results, boards need to be kept to a certain size beyond which efficiency and ability
to carry out their corporate governance functions seem to deteriorate. CEOs may
personally benefit in the form of higher compensation when boards are larger, but
shareholders may suffer.
It is generally believed that smaller and more independent boards work best.
However, Coles, Daniel, and Naveen have shown that optimal board size varies by
type of firm.80 They find that more complex firms, firms that have greater advising
requirements, have larger boards and a greater percentage of outside directors. They
found that for complex firms Tobin q values increase with board size. There is also

evidence that firms with larger boards have less volatile stock returns and accounting
returns on assets.81
Kini, Kracaw, and Mian found that board size tended to shrink after tender offers
for firms that were not performing well.82 This implies that disciplinary takeovers, or at
least the threat of such takeovers, tend to reduce the size of boards to that which the
market believes may be more effective. When companies receive such hostile bids, they
may be good buys for the bidder, which sees the company as relatively cheap when its
market value is compared with the bidder’s perception of its intrinsic value. The com-
pany may respond by taking various actions that will make it become less vulnerable to
a takeover. The Kini et al. study implies that among these actions may be reductions in
the board size.
Cornelli and Karakas analyzed how private equity firms and management govern
the companies they have taken private in LBOs and MBOs.83 They found that the
post-LBO company that was once public but is then private has a smaller board and few
outside directors. In addition, board size tended to decline over time after the buyout.
In management buyouts the board consists of managers. Companies that had a larger
number of outside directors prior to the buyout were taken by these researchers to be
ones that might have presented more managerial challenges. Such companies tended
to have a larger presence of private equity sponsors on the board than companies with
more insiders on the board prior to the buyout.

Role of the Board of Directors

Director Characteristics
Corporate boards have slowly become more diverse over time although they still have
a long way to go. At S&P500 companies, only 20% of all directors are female.84 This is
significantly higher than some European countries, such as Germany (5%) and France
(8%), but well below countries such as Norway (39%) and Sweden (22%).85 Adams and
Ferreira found that some aspects of corporate governance improve when female rep-
resentation on boards increases.86 Female directors have better attendance than their
male counterparts, and male attendance actually improves after the appointment of
female directors. They also found that CEO turnover was more sensitive to the market
performance of the company’s stock and that directors receive more equity-based com-
pensation in boards that were more gender-diverse.
Gender diversity seems to affect the propensity of companies to do M&As. Levi,
Li, and Zhang analyzed acquisition bids of S&P1500 companies over the period
1997–2009.87 They found that each additional female director is associated with 7.6%
fewer bids and 15.4% reduced bid premiums. Perhaps women feel less need to build
empires at shareholder expense.88
The increase in the percentage of female directors may overstate the gains women
have really made in the corporate boardroom. Deb Henretta and Kimberly Whitler deter-
mined that for Fortune 500 companies, women make up over one-third of corporate
responsibility committees and over 20% of human resources committees but occupy low
percentages of the strategy/financial and executive committees.89 Thus, merely looking
at the number of females on corporate boards may not be enough.
Large-capcompanieshavemadesomemodestimprovementsoverthepastdecadein
becoming more racially diverse.90 Nonetheless, boards at most such companies remain
under the control of white males and mainly older white males.
In 2004 the average age of an S&P500 independent director was 60.5 but by 2016
it rose to 63.0.91 While lifestyle changes imply that 60s is not that old an age anymore,
research by Masulis et al. does show age-related governance differences.92 They found
that directors aged 65 or older were more likely to be absent from meetings compared
to their younger counterparts. Boards with older directors were also more likely to pay
the CEO more and are likely like to have CEO turnover. They are also more likely to

have incidents of financial misreporting. This lends support for the fact that S&P500
companies more often have in place mandatory retirement ages of 75 for directors.
There is evidence that good directors, ones whom the market reacts positively to
when appointed, are often CEOs of other companies. In a study of Fortune 1000 firms
Eliezer Fich found that not only was this generally the case but also it was particularly
true for companies with greater growth opportunities.93 There is also evidence that
companies tend to appoint directors who are overly sympathetic to management.
Cohen, Frazzini, and Malloy analyzed a database of former sell-side analysts who were
subsequently appointed to boards they previously covered.94 The analysts who became
board members were far more likely to issue strong buy recommendations when they
were covering the companies than their peers. However, the relative recommendations
were poor. These findings support the belief that companies have a tendency to hire
directors who are supportive of management and who are more cheerleaders than
objective critics.
Companies that are more reliant on government work or work that can be influ-
enced by lobbying tend to hire directors who have significant political or regulatory
experience. There is evidence that directors tend to direct the companies whose boards
they sit on to utilize services of their field. For example, Gunber, Malmendier, and Tate
showed that when more commercial bankers were on the board, companies increased
the size of their loans, whereas when investment bankers were more present on the
board, companies utilized more outside financing.95
Director Compensation
The average board of director compensation for the companies in the S&P500 index
was $285,000.96 A little over one-half (54%) of this compensation is from stock awards
and 38% are cash fees. As would be expected, this compensation varies with company
size, with larger companies paying higher fees. When directors sit on committees that
present greater time demands, their compensation is usually higher. However, a Korn
Ferry Directors Survey showed that directors devote an average of 250 to 300 hours a
year to their oversight duties. Using an average of 275 hours, this translates to an hourly
rate in excess of $1,000 per hour. We have noted that over one-half of director compen-
sation was from stock grants. In a study of over 200 firms from the Fortune 1000 that
offered stock option compensation to directors, Fich and Shivdasani found that such
compensation was more likely when boards were dominated by outside directors and
when institutional equity ownership was high.97 They also found that such plans were
more likely to occur in high-growth companies.

Role of the Board of Directors
◾
509
Prestige of Directorships and Allocation of Directors’ Time
Due to the fact that some directors may sit on multiple boards, the question arises of
how they allocate their time across the different boards. Masculis and Mobbs analyzed
a large sample of 86,330 director years for 17,525 outside directors over the years
1997–2006.98 They found that the reputation of a company was a key determinant n
the allocation of directors’ time. They found that directors spend more time working on
boards whose companies are larger and more prestigious compared to less prestigious
assignments. When the prestige of an assignment rises due to external factors affecting
the company, the directors allocate more of their time to that firm. When a firm declines,
such as when it has a significant falloff in revenues or profitability, the directors may
devote less time and may even resign. Thus reputational incentives are a key element
in determining whether individuals accept and devote significant time to certain
directorships. Once again, basic human nature can be a great guide to understanding
human behavior.
Role of Social Ties in M&A Returns
In business and in life, sometimes it matters more whom you know than what you
know. Social connections can play a major role in career success. How about M&A
returns? In an analysis of 539 acquisitions over the period between 1999 and 2007
Ishii and Xuan showed that social ties between the directors and senior managers of
acquiring and target firms had a significantly negative effect on acquirer returns and
those of the combined entity.99 These ties, though, did increase the likelihood that the
target’s CEO and more of the target’s directors stayed on after the deal.
COCA-COLA’S PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF
QUAKER OATS*
W
hile it seems that many boards simply rubberstamp M&As proposed by their
CEOs, some boards have the foresight and the courage to stand up to
the CEO and question proposed deals. This was the case when a $15.75 billion
offer for Quaker Oats was proposed to Coca-Cola Company’s board of directors
in November 2001. Quaker Oats had a certain appeal to Coca-Cola because it
included its popular Gatorade line, which might ﬁt in well with Coke’s other soft
drink products. Gatorade commands more than 80% of the sports drink market,
whereas Coke’s own Powerade brand accounted for just over 10% of that market.
The whole sports drink business had grown signiﬁcantly; Powerade had a distant
second position to the leader Gatorade, and Coke was having great difﬁculty gaining
ground on the leader. Acquiring Gatorade through an acquisition of Quaker Oats
could have been a quick solution to this problem. However, the acquisition also

presented a problem because Coke most likely would have been forced by antitrust
regulators to divest Powerade in order to have the deal approved.
Coke was not the ﬁrst bidder for Quaker Oats. On November 1, 2000, Pepsi
made an initial offer for Quaker following negotiations between Robert Enrico,
Pepsi’s CEO, and Robert Morrison, Quaker’s CEO. However, after Quaker could
not get Pepsi to agree on improved terms, including a stock collar provision,
negotiations between Pepsi and Quaker broke down. Quaker was then in play,
and other potential bidders, such as Coke and French food giant Group Danone,
expressed interest in the U.S. food company. Both companies made competing bids,
which featured improved terms over Pepsi’s bid, yet Pepsi held fast and declined to
exceed its prior offer. Coke’s CEO assured Quaker Oats that he had been keeping
his board apprised of the bid’s progress, and had asked and received agreement
from Quaker to exclusively negotiate with just Coke. Coke’s CEO, Douglas Daft,
however, did not count on the negative response of the market to the deal (see
Figure A).a The board, however, was mindful of the market, and after a long meeting
on November 21, 2000, they forced Daft to go back to Quaker Oats and inform
them that Coke was pulling out of the negotiations. The market loved this, and
the stock price immediately rose. Pepsi eventually acquired Quaker Oats in August
2001 for $13 billion.

There were some clear problems with the deal that Coke’s board obviously paid
attention to. As already noted, the market did not like the proposed acquisition, and
it voiced its displeasure by dropping its valuation of Coke’s stock. In the years before
the Coke bid, the company had experienced problems with other failed acquisitions,
and the spotlight was on its merger strategy. Right at the start, management faced
an uphill battle. Another problem with the deal was that the acquisition would
require Coke to be able to effectively manage the components of Quaker Oats’

business that were outside of Coke’s soft- and sports-drink business lines. These
were Quaker’s food brands, which included Captain Crunch cereals, Rice-A-Roni,
and Aunt Jemima pancakes, as well as other snack products, such as rice cakes and
granola bars. Some of Quaker’s brands were impressive, but they were a little far
aﬁeld from Coke’s core business. Another problem with the deal was its defensive
nature. Coke’s bid was in response to Pepsi’s original offer. Such defensive responses
are not the best motive for a merger or acquisition.
One of the reasons why the Coke board stood up to this proposal lies in the
nature of its board and their relationship with the CEO. Coke had a CEO, Roberto
Goizueta, who was highly acclaimed. Unfortunately, after many successful years at
the helm of the soft drink giant, Goizueta passed away in October 1997 at a relatively
young age. He was succeeded by Douglas Ivester, who resigned at the end of 1999
and was replaced by Douglas Daft, who was well thought of but could not draw on
the track record of success that Goizueta enjoyed. Perhaps if Goizueta had brought
this deal to the board, they might have considered it more seriously. Nonetheless,
there is little reason to believe that they would have ultimately approved it no matter
who brought the deal because they considered it generally ﬂawed.
Coke’s board featured some leading business ﬁgures, including the renowned
Warren Buffett, who is considered by many to be one of the market’s shrewdest
investors, as well as a new CEO who was looking to make a name for himself. This
board, however, would have none of it. In 2006, Buffett announced he would step
down from Coke’s board, creating a void that would be hard to ﬁll.
The board of directors is one of the last lines of defense against poorly con-
ceived merger strategies. In order for it to work with maximum effectiveness, the
board needs to be knowledgeable and strong-willed. However, it is not enough that
a board be composed of individuals who are strong-willed and capable of standing
up to the management leaders of the company. Knowledge of the industry and the
company’s operations is also essential to being an effective director. Management,
who runs the company on a day-to-day basis, should have a distinct advantage
over board members who are engaged full-time in other activities, such as running
their own companies, and have not invested nearly as much time as management
in studying the company. However, there is a certain minimum level of knowledge
that the board must have in order for it to function properly. When considering the
commitment of billions of dollars in merger costs, the board needs to get whatever
resources it needs to be able to effectively evaluate management’s proposals. If
this means retaining outside consultants to study the proposal in depth, then this
should be done. This is sometimes difﬁcult to do because the proposals may be
time-sensitive and require a quick response. Nonetheless, the board must apply
all of the necessary resources to reach an enlightened and impartial decision. The
bigger the deal, the more work and research the board needs to do. However, in
the case of Coke’s offer for Quaker Oats, the board’s studied response was clear and
strong. In properly exercising their ﬁduciary responsibilities, they saved shareholders
from a possibly costly acquisition.

ANTITAKEOVER MEASURES AND BOARD CHARACTERISTICS
Do companies adopt antitakeover defenses to avoid the disciplinary pressure of the
takeover market? Are certain types of boards more likely to adopt such defenses?
A study by Brickley, Terry, and Coles found that board compensation affected the
likelihood that a company would adopt a poison pill defense.100 The Brickley et al. study
analyzed the role that the composition of the board might play in any negative reaction
the market might have to the adoption of poison pills by 247 companies over the period
1984–1986. This was a period where prior research had shown that the negative
market reaction to poison pills was the greatest. They found a statistically significant
positive relation between the stock market’s reaction to the adoption of poison pills and
the percentage of the board accounted for by outside directors. The market’s reaction
was positive when the board was dominated by outsiders and negative when it was
dominated by insider board members. This implies that the market tended to believe that
when an outside-dominated board adopted a strong antitakeover defense like a poison
pill, they did so to advance shareholder wealth. However, when an insider-dominated
board took the same action, the market seemed to believe that they were doing this
to entrench managers and insulate them from the disciplinary forces of the takeover
market. The market was also saying that it believes that outside directors represent
shareholder interests better than insider directors.
Masculis, Wang, and Xie looked at the impact of corporate governance on acquirer
returns.101 They found that companies that had several antitakeover defenses in place
had significantly lower returns when they announced takeovers of other companies.
This research lends support to the view that the market casts a dim eye on an acquisi-
tion strategy that is put forward by management that is insulated from market forces by
antitakeover measures. The market may believe, with justification, that such managers
are more likely to engage in value-destroying empire building.
HOLLINGER INTERNATIONAL*
T
he 2004 probe of Hollinger International into what it referred to as a “corporate
kleptocracy” was released at the end of summer 2004. The report, issued by a
special committee of the Hollinger board of directors, found that the company’s
CEO, Conrad Black, and ex-president, David Radler, “siphoned off more than
$400 million through aggressive looting of the publishing company.”a Hollinger
International is a publishing company that publishes various newspapers, including
the Chicago Sun-Times and the Jerusalem Post. Black controlled Hollinger through a
holding company he owned, Ravelston, which owned 78% of the stock of a Canadian

company, Hollinger Inc., which in turn owned 68% of the voting shares in Hollinger
International. Through his control of a 68% interest in Hollinger International, Black
was able to effectively inﬂuence the board of directors.
One astounding ﬁnding of the report was that the total cash taken equaled
“95.2% of Hollinger’s entire adjusted net income during the period 1997–2003!”b
The probe of the activities of Hollinger’s CEO and ex-president was headed by
former SEC chairman Richard Breeden and was ﬁled with the federal courts and
the SEC. Black and Radler engaged in lavish spending that included $24,950 for
summer drinks, $3,530 for silverware for their corporate jet, which they put to
regular personal use, thousands of dollars for handbags, tickets for the theater
and opera, as well as very generous donations made by the company to charities
and establishments favored by Black and his wife, columnist Barbara Black. The
couple threw lavish dinner parties for friends, including Henry Kissinger, who was,
coincidentally, on the board of directors. Birthday parties for Mrs. Black were thrown
at the company’s expense. One such party for 80 guests cost the company $42,870.
Other examples of looting of the company were a 10-day vacation to Bora Bora at a
cost of $250,000 and refurbishing work on Black’s Rolls-Royce, which cost $90,000.c
Black and Radler took compensation from the company in several ways, including
$218 million in management fees that they derived over the period of 1997–2003.
Management fees were paid to Ravelston, while Hollinger International also paid
“noncompete” fees to other entities controlled by Ravelston. In addition, Hollinger
sold newspaper businesses to entities controlled by Lord Black and his associates
for below-market values. These included the sale of the Mammouth Times, in
Mammouth Lakes, California, which went for “$1 when there was a competing bid of
$1.25 million.”d
The report called the board and the audit committee’s monitoring of payments
such as these management fees “inept.” The board of directors included some
very prominent names in international diplomacy. Among its members was former
secretary of state Henry Kissinger, as well as former assistant secretary of defense in
the Reagan administration Richard Perle, and James Thompson, former governor of
Illinois, who headed the company’s audit committee. While such political ﬁgures may
be world-renowned, it is not clear what special expertise they brought to the board
of directors of a publishing company. Clearly, if one wanted to talk foreign affairs at a
board meeting, this was probably a board that could have an enlightening discussion
on such topics. If it was corporate oversight you were looking for, the track record of
these directors was dismal at best. The report of the special committee particularly
singled out Perle for “repeatedly breaching his ﬁduciary duties as a member of the
executive committee of the board, by authorizing unfair related party transactions
that enabled Black and Radler to evade disclosure to the audit committee. The
report calls on Perle to return $3 million in compensation he received from the
company.”e
Hollinger’s use of former political ﬁgures as directors of the corporation is not
unusual. However, it is not clear what specialized expertise they bring to overseeing
a corporation. Many have worked in the public sector much if not all of their careers,
isolated from the pressures of running an organization to turn a proﬁt. Often their
leading expertise is to market themselves to the public to gain votes.
Hollinger’s board also included friends and family members. For example,
Lord Black’s wife, Barbara Amiel Black, was on the board, along with family friend

Marie-Josee Kravis, the wife of ﬁnancier Henry Kravis of Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts.
Clearly, Black pushed the appointment of directors to an extreme. This became
possible because Black controlled the votes required to place individuals on the
board. The hand-picked board appeared to have been kept in the dark, as Black
could keep them, but they did not go to any great lengths to remove themselves
from any clouds that he surrounded them with. They were being taken care of
very well by Black and Hollinger and did not seem to want to rock the boat. The
following passage from the Wall Street Journal that describes one Hollinger board
meeting is instructive of the atmosphere in Hollinger’s boardroom:
Gathered around a mahogany table in a boardroom high above Manhattan’s Park
Avenue, eight directors of the newspaper publisher, owner of the Chicago Sun-Times
and the Jerusalem Post, dined on grilled tuna and chicken served on royal blue
Bernardaud china, according to two attendees. Marie-Josee Kravis, wife of ﬁnancier
Henry Kravis, chatted about world affairs with Lord Black and A. Alfred Taubman,
then chairman of Sotheby’s. Turning to business, the board rapidly approved a series
of transactions, according to the minutes and a report later commissioned by
Hollinger. The board awarded a private company, controlled by Lord Black, $38
million in “management fees” as part of a move by Lord Black’s team to essentially
outsource the company’s management to itself. It agreed to sell two proﬁtable
community newspapers to another private company controlled by Lord Black and
Hollinger executives for $1 apiece. The board also gave Lord Black and his
colleagues a cut of proﬁts from a Hollinger Internet unit. Finally, the directors gave
themselves a raise. The meeting lasted about an hour and a half, according to
minutes and two directors who were present.f
One lesson we can learn from the Hollinger scandal is that a board should not
be too close to the CEO, and deﬁnitely should not be picked by the CEO. The board
needs to be somewhat at arm’s length from those whom they will be monitoring.
If they are indebted to the CEO, then how objective will they be in pursuing the
interests of shareholders? This lesson, however, ﬂies in the face of the recent trend
of activist hedge fund managers who seek to place their own handpicked members
on target boards who would, presumably, represent their interests of the hedge
fund and not necessarily other shareholders.

Disciplinary Takeovers, Company Performance, CEOs, and boards
◾
515
DISCIPLINARY TAKEOVERS, COMPANY PERFORMANCE,
CEOs, AND BOARDS
The board of directors, as fiduciaries of shareholders, monitor the performance of the
company and management, including the CEO. This is the internal process we referred
to earlier. When this process fails to yield acceptable results, external forces may come
into play. This is often done through disciplinary takeovers of poorly performing com-
panies. Kini, Kracaw, and Mian analyzed a sample of 244 tender offers and looked at
the effects that these hostile bids had on CEO and director turnover.102 They found an
inverse relationship between posttakeover CEO turnover and pretakeover performance.
Companies that yielded poor performance prior to the takeover were more likely to have
their CEO replaced. However, this finding was not substantiated in certain situations.
It was the case when the companies had insider-dominated boards but not the case
when the boards were dominated by outside directors. This finding seems to imply that
when the board was composed mainly of outsiders, the problem was not the CEO; oth-
erwise, the outsiders on the board would have already changed the CEO.
The Kini, Kracaw, and Mian study also found that board composition tended to be
changed following disciplinary takeovers. Boards that were previously dominated by
insiders were changed and the number of insiders reduced. This implies that the bidders
identified the composition of the board, and the large number of insiders, as a potential
source of problems the company may have had. In making these changes, the takeover
market altered board composition. However, this is an expensive way of making such
changes.
There is some evidence that the effect of disciplinary takeovers is greatest in more
active takeover markets. Mikkelson and Partch found a greater rate of CEO, president,
and board chair turnover for companies that were performing poorly in an active
takeover market relative to a less active takeover market.103 Specifically, they found that
33% of the companies in the “poor performer” sample experienced complete turnover
of the CEO, president, and board chair during the 1984–1986 time period, which were
years within the fourth merger wave. This was almost double the 17% rate they found
for comparable performing companies during the less active 1989–1993 time period.
Takeovers can serve an important role in eliminating poor managers. It is important
to note that this can take place even if the company is not taken over. Directors are
aware of the intensity of the takeover market and some will act before the company
actually receives an unwanted bid. However, this study implies that they may monitor
and change the CEO more aggressively in an active takeover market. This has been
confirmed by other research that shows that management turnover is greater when
companies are actually taken over.104 The threat of a takeover alone can bring about

turnover of top management.105 This implies that active takeover markets can be good
for corporate governance. Conversely, it also implies that a sluggish takeover market
may not be best for shareholders interested in improving corporate governance.
MERGER STRATEGY AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Having discussed corporate governance in this chapter, we will focus on the relationship
between corporate governance and merger strategy. We will try to determine whether
better corporate governance means that companies will carry out more or fewer deals.
How does the quality of corporate governance affect the types of deals that are done and
the shareholders’ returns that these transactions generate? These are the issues that we
will focus on for the rest of this chapter.
CEO COMPENSATION AND M&A PROGRAMS
Larger companies have higher revenues and greater assets, and they also have higher
costs. Part of these costs is management compensation and CEO compensation in par-
ticular. Therefore, one of the ways CEOs of companies can get paid more is to run larger
companies. They can do that by finding a position managing a large company or by con-
verting their current corporation into a larger one through M&A. It is this latter motive,
and the link between CEO compensation and M&A programs, that we want to explore.
Hallock and Torok examined the compensation packages of more than 2,300 CEOs
of publicly traded companies of various different sizes. They found out that for every
1% increase in company size, CEO compensation went up by one-third of 1%.106 Stated
alternatively, for every 10% increase in company size, CEO compensation increases by
approximately 3%. Another study of the largest 1,000 U.S. companies by Steven Hall &
Partners showed that the median 2005 CEO compensation at the top 27 companies in
their sample, $16.8 million, was five times greater than the $3.2 million median com-
pensation of the CEOs at the smallest quintile.107 Thus, CEOs have a great incentive to
use M&A to make their companies bigger and their paycheck larger. It is up to the boards
to make sure that CEOs are pursuing M&A programs for the financial gain of the share-
holders and not just for their own personal gain.
DO BOARDS REWARD CEOs FOR INITIATING ACQUISITIONS
AND MERGERS?
It is well known that many deals do not fare well; one wonders why boards are so willing
to approve M&A proposals. Ironically, there is even evidence that boards actually

CEO Compensation and Diversiﬁcation Strategies

encourage CEOs to pursue such deals. A study was conducted by Grinstein and Hribar
of 327 large M&As that occurred during the fifth merger wave period, 1993–1999.108
They examined proxy statements that broke down CEO compensation into individual
components with an eye toward identifying which companies attributed part of the
CEO’s compensation to his ability to complete M&As. They found that in 39% of cases
they considered, the compensation committee cited completion of a deal as the reason
they provided certain compensation. In other instances companies awarded bonuses
following deals even though they did not specify that the bonuses were for deals. This
implies that the real percentage of boards that gave bonuses for mergers was even
higher than the 39% that overtly cited this as a reason.
Consistent with much other research in M&A, Grinstein and Hribar noted that
bidder announcement period returns were negative for the companies included in
their sample. However, they found that the negative reaction was greatest in cases
when the CEOs had the greatest corporate power as reflected by the CEO also being
head of the board of directors. The market often seems to not only dislike acquisitions
but also really dislike deals done by CEOs whose power is less constrained by the board
of directors. The market seems to prefer more power limitations on the CEO and will
penalize companies less for doing acquisitions when they know that there is a group
of directors who are potentially capable of preventing the CEO from doing deals that
might not be in the best interest of the company. Whether the board actually does this
is another issue.
Grinstein and Hribar found not only that the market reacted more negatively to
deals done by CEOs with more power, but also that managers of companies who had
more power got higher bonuses and tended to do bigger deals. Their power was less
checkedandtheyseemedtopersonallygainfromthissituation—attheexpenseofshare-
holders.
Another study also found that companies that were active in M&A paid higher com-
pensation to their managers. Schmidt and Fowler analyzed a sample of 127 companies,
of which 41 were bidders that used tender offers to make acquisitions, 51 were non-
tender offer acquirers, and 35 were control firms.109 They found that both bidders and
acquirers showed higher managerial compensation than the control group.
These studies show that boards tend to pay managers of companies that are active in
M&A greater compensation. When one considers the questionable track record of many
M&As, we have to conclude that boards need to rethink such M&A-based incentives.
CEO COMPENSATION AND DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES
In Chapter 4 we saw that diversification strategies generally cause the shareholders
of companies pursuing such strategies to lose value. There are some examples of

diversified companies, such as GE, who generated significant gains for shareholders.
In addition, we have also discussed in Chapter 4 the fact that not all diversifications
are the same, with related diversifications yielding better performance than unrelated
diversifying deals. In spite of the dubious track record of diversifications, it is surpris-
ing to see that companies pay their CEOs a diversification premium—meaning that
research has shown the CEOs of diversified companies earn on average 13% more than
CEOs of companies that operate in only one line of business. We have already noted
that Malmendier and Tate found that overconfident CEOs are more likely to pursue
value-destroying deals and, in particular, diversification strategies.110 There is some
evidence that eventually diversification strategies lead to lower CEO compensation, but
the process of correcting the CEO compensation level seems to be slow.111 Boards seem
to be slow to stop diversification deals recommended by CEOs and penalize them after
the fact in the form of lower compensation.
AGENCY COSTS AND DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES
Agency costs may help explain the tendency of some CEOs and their companies to
engage in diversifying M&As. Management may be pursuing a merger strategy that
generates gains for themselves, even though such a strategy may not be the one that
is in the best interest of shareholders. That is, the agents of the owners, the managers,
derive private benefits that are greater than their own private costs from doing these
deals. Diversifying deals may provide managers greater prestige and what economists
call “psychic income.” They may also generate other direct monetary gains, such as
higher compensation that is paid to management of larger companies. Denis, Denis, and
Sarin analyzed a sample of 933 firms starting in 1984.112 They examined the degree of
ownership held by managers and related this to the tendency of managers with different
percentages of equity ownership to engage in diversifying deals, which research has
shown often tend to reduce shareholder value. They found that diversification, moving
the company into other business segments, was more likely to reduce shareholder
values when CEO ownership was lower (e.g., less than 5% of the outstanding shares).
Such deals, however, had a mild positive effect when the CEO’s ownership shares were
greater than 5%. Similar effects were found when they looked at the combined share
percentages owned by overall management. They also found that there was a strong
relation between decreases in diversification and external control threats. Almost one
in five of the decreases in diversification, such as selling off diversified divisions, was
preceded by a takeover bid. In other words, decreases in diversification were associated
with market pressure. This implies that often management may not be willing to sell off

Interests of Directors and M&As

prior acquisitions that reduced shareholder value until they were faced with an outside
bidder that may be taking advantage of reduced stock values relative to the underlying
value of the divisions if they were sold separately on the market. If the diversification
strategy reduced value, it made the company vulnerable to a takeover, and when the
takeover threats materialized, management financially responded by refocusing.
The agency costs hypothesis can partially explain the tendency of some companies
to engage in diversifying deals. This hypothesis is also consistent with the reaction of
management to outside threats. However, we do not have to rely just on outside market
forces to limit these costs. Boards are in a good position to prevent deals that will reduce
shareholder value. Directors need to be aware of the track record of certain types of deals
and make sure that management and the CEO do not get to complete them. They also
need to be aware of the company’s own track record of deals. Some companies, such as
AT&T and Daimler, have a very poor M&A track record. Boards of such companies need
to be especially wary.
INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND M&As
Directors are fiduciaries for shareholders, and as such they have the responsibility to
oversee the management and direction of the company so that the goals of shareholder
wealth maximization are pursued. However, it would be naive for us to ignore the fact
that directors are human and also consider what is in their own interests. How are
directors affected by takeovers? Directors of target companies are usually not retained
after the takeover by a company. The bidding company already has a board of directors,
and there is usually no place or need for the target’s directors. Therefore, the target
directors know that the takeover will normally bring an end to their directorships. This
may or may not be an important issue to them—depending on their own personal
circumstances.
The personal, adverse financial impact on a target director as a result of approving
a merger or hostile takeover has been documented in a study by Harford, who consid-
ered 1,091 directors of Fortune 1000 companies over the period 1988–1991.113 As
expected, he remarked that directors of target companies were rarely retained after the
merger or acquisition. However, what was especially interesting was the fact that such
directors were less likely to get another director’s post in the future. This is the case for
both inside and outside directors. Harford also found that directors of poorly performing
companies whose companies were, nonetheless, able to be acquired do not seem to suffer
a reduced frequency of future directorships. Conversely, directors of poorly performing
companies that mounted antitakeover defenses that successfully prevented takeovers
were less likely to be directors of companies in the future. These findings are remark-
able as they imply that the market for directors seems to be pretty efficient in weeding
out those directors who may place their own interests ahead of those of shareholders.

Corporate Governance
Investment Bankers and Directors
Sometimes companies ask investment bankers to serve on their boards. Such individ-
uals can bring a wealth of experience to a board, although they may also bring with
them some conflicts, which we will discuss shortly. With respect to takeovers, however,
Huang, Jiang, Lie, and Yang found that having investment bankers (IBs) on the board
may yield various financial benefits.114 In an analysis of 41,393 firm-year observations
over the period 1998–2008 they found a positive relation between having IBs on the
board and the probability of doing M&As. They also found that when such companies
do M&As they get 0.8% higher abnormal announcement period returns. This effect was
higher the larger the deal. Huang et al. then went on to try to determine the source of the
higher returns. They found that acquirers with IBs on their boards tended to pay lower
takeover premiums in deals involving larger companies. They also paid lower advisory
fees. Last but not least, they found that these IB-director companies tended to have better
operating performance than companies without IB directors. The study makes a good
case for companies, especially ones that are considering being active in M&A, having
investment bankers on the board.
While Huang et al.’s research paints IB directors in a very favorable light, other
research does not. Guner, Malmendier, and Tate assembled a large dataset of 32,943
“director-years” covering the period 1998–2001.115 They found that when commercial
bankers (CBs) join boards, the companies utilized more external capital. This increase
did not turn out to be fruitful as they showed that it involved companies with good credit,
and therefore a good ability to borrow, but, unfortunately, the firms had poor invest-
ment opportunities. They also noticed that companies seem to ask CBs to join boards
when they want to borrow more and the CBs tend to leave the boards sometime after
the financing.
Wheninvestment bankersjoined the boards, thecompaniesdid morebond offerings
and engaged in poorer acquisitions. Guner et al. compared M&A announced returns
over a relatively long window of 36 months before and after the announcement. They
found firms with IBs showed clearly negative returns following the announcement,
while those without IBs showed the opposite. Thus, it seems the effects of IBs will vary
on a case-by-case basis, which may explain the different results from these studies,
which used different samples.
MANAGERIAL COMPENSATION AND FIRM SIZE
It has long been postulated by economists that managers run companies in a manner
that is more consistent with revenue maximization than profit maximization.116 This

is based on the purported relationship between managerial compensation and firm size.
The optimal firm size may be less than that which would maximize revenues. The reason
why researchers theorize that management would want to have a larger than optimal
company is the positive relationship between firm size and managerial compensation.
Seniormanagementoflargercompaniestendstoearnmorethantheirsmallercorporate
counterparts.117 Lambert, Larcker, and Weigelt have shown that this positive associa-
tion exists for most major levels of management:
◾
Corporate CEO: the manager with the greatest authority in the company
◾
Group CEO: a manager who has authority for various different subgroups within
the overall corporation
◾
Subgroup CEO: senior manager of one of the individual subgroups
◾
Divisional CEO: senior manager of a division or corporate unit
◾
Plant manager: senior manager of a cost center118
The Lambert et al. results for these broad categories of management may help
explain why there may not be as much managerial resistance to the recommendations
of very senior management who advocate transactions that result in greater corporate
size but not necessarily greater profitability. Their findings are not unique to this
field of research. In general, research in this area tends to show that there is a good
relationship between company size and executive compensation but a poor one between
compensation and corporate performance.119
CORPORATE CONTROL DECISIONS AND THEIR
SHAREHOLDER WEALTH EFFECTS
Does the nature of management’s compensation agreements affect the likelihood that
managers will pursue M&As? If this is the case, then does the market react differently
when these deals are pursued by managers who receive a significant percentage of their
compensation from equity-based components? Dutta, Dutta, and Raman analyzed a
sample of 1,719 acquisitions made by U.S. companies over the period 1993–1998.120
This was a period of large increases in stock option–based compensation for senior exec-
utives.Therefore,itisanexcellenttimeperiodtotestmarketreactionsasafunctionofthe

Corporate Governance
high equity-based compensation tended to receive positive stock market responses to the
announcement of their acquisitions while those with lower equity-based manager com-
pensation tended to receive negative reactions. The market seemed to assume that given
the financial impact that these deals would have on the equity holdings of managers,
they would not pursue them if they were not wealth-enhancing for shareholders.
Dutta et al. also looked at the size of the takeover premium paid by acquiring firms.
When managers had their own wealth at risk, due to the impact that a premium may
have on their equity-based compensation, were the premiums they offered different?
Interestingly, they found that companies with higher equity-based compensation
tended to pay lower premiums. Once again, when managers are playing with their
own money, to some extent, they are more frugal with exchanging premiums, whereas
when they are playing with “house money”—shareholder wealth—they will tend
to be more generous and more liberally give away corporate wealth. Dutta et al.
also found that high equity-based compensation managers tended to acquire targets
with higher growth opportunities than their lower equity-based counterparts did.
That is, they tended to acquire companies with a greater likelihood of generating
equity-based gains for both themselves and shareholders. Moreover, they found that
lower equity-based compensation managers/companies significantly underperformed
their higher equity-based counterparts.
The Dutta et al. study implies that if management’s interests are aligned with
shareholders’, they tend to do better deals and pay less. It also seems to be reasonable
to assume that such managers may try harder to pursue value-increasing deals. The
market is aware of this and reacts more positively when such managers announce deals
but penalizes acquiring shareholders when they, and their board of directors, allow
managers to push deals when they do not have their own compensation at risk.
Moeller analyzed the target takeover premiums for a sample of 373 deals over the
period of 1990–1999.121 Consistent with the general conclusions from Dutta et al.,
but now applied to the target as opposed to the bidder, Moeller found that targets that
are highly controlled by certain shareholders received lower takeover premiums. On the
other hand, targets that had more outside directors and outside blockholders tended to
receive higher premiums. He found that targets with entrenched CEOs received lower
premiums. It is important to note, however, that these results precede the period when
activist hedge funds became a more significant factor in the takeover market. It is rea-
sonable to conclude that such findings may not apply to cases where they amass stock
in a target and seek to have the target sold to the highest bidder.
DOES BETTER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INCREASE FIRM
VALUE?
We have already answered the foregoing question in a piecemeal fashion by looking
at specific governance issues, such as director independence, and noted that research
finds a clear linkage between better governance and firm value. Many of these studies

use short-term-oriented event studies to ascertain the effects of specific governance ele-
ments. We have already discussed how such studies can be quite telling when it comes
to determining long-term effects. However, the previously discussed study by Gomers,
Ishii, and Metrick used a governance index (G) to test the shareholder wealth effects
of a collection of governance factors.122 They created their index using 24 corporate
governance measures for 1,500 large companies over the 1990s. The data were culled
from the Investor Responsibility Research Center’s database of corporate charter provi-
sions.Amongtheseareantigreenmailandclassifiedboardprovision,poisonpills,golden
parachutes, and many others. They found that corporate governance was closely related
to value of firms as measured by Tobin’s q. The way they constructed their index, lower G
values were indicative of better governance. Not only did lower G values result in higher
qs, but also the relationship got significantly stronger as the researchers traced their
sample over the 1990s. They found that at the beginning of the decade, a one-point
increase in G was associated with a 2.2% decrease in q values. By the end of the 1990s,
aone-pointincreaseinGwasassociatedwithan11.4%decreaseinqvalues.Thisimplies
that not only is corporate governance inextricably linked to firm values but also the
relationship has become stronger over time.
Masulis, Wang, and Xie analyzed a large sample of 3,333 completed acquisitions
over the period of 1990–2003. They found that companies that had more antitakeover
measures in place were more likely to conduct value-destroying acquisitions.123 They
concluded that these results support the hypothesis that managers of companies with
more antitakeover defenses in place tend to indulge in empire building since they are
more insulated from the pressures of the market for corporate control that otherwise
might force them to be more “honest.”
In another approach to measuring the relationship between corporate governance
and equity returns, the Corporate Library compiled three hypothetical portfolios that
had different degrees of strict corporate governance.124 They compared these greater
corporate governance portfolios with the market as measured by the Russell 1000.
Over the study period, July 2003–January 2010, the various corporate governance
portfolios outperformed the market, with the portfolio with the strictest governance
yielding an additional 74 basis points on an industry-weighted basis relative to
the market.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND COMPETITION
Theoretically, in highly competitive markets, “managerial slack” will result in lower
returns and competitive forces will bring about changes to move a company toward
more optimal performance. However, we all know that markets are far from perfect.
Indeed, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan believed that market forces would
pressure financial institutions to act in their own long-term best interests, and this belief

in market forces and a laissez faire approach to financial regulation clearly backfired,
leading to the recent subprime crisis. Giroud and Mueller analyzed the role of industry
competition and corporate governance by examining the impact of the adoption of
business combination laws on operating performance of companies after the passage
of these laws.125 They found that operating performance declined in noncompeti-
tive industries but not in competitive ones. They noted that input costs, wages, and
overhead all increased after the passage of these laws in noncompetitive industries
but not in competitive ones. Interestingly, the market seems to correctly anticipate
the true effects. When the passage of the laws was announced, share values of the
companies in noncompetitive industries declined, whereas that was not the case in
competitive ones.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND POSTACQUISITION
PERFORMANCE
Is the compensation of senior management affected by the success or failure of acqui-
sition programs? For companies that pursue large-volume acquisition programs, with
M&As being an integral part of their growth strategy, linking managerial compen-
sation to the success of those deals makes good sense. Schmidt and Fowler analyzed
a sample of 127 companies, of which 41 were bidders that used tender offers to
make acquisitions, 51 were nontender offer acquirers, and 35 were control firms.126
Consistent with research previously discussed, bidder companies, those that would
more likely be involved in initiating hostile takeovers, showed a significant decrease in
postacquisition shareholder returns. This was not the case for acquirers who did not
use tender offers, as well as for the control group. Also interesting from a corporate
governance perspective was that both bidders and acquirers showed higher managerial
compensation than the control group. Takeovers pay “dividends” for management in
the form of higher compensation, even though they may generate losses for share-
holders of those companies that use tender offers and hostile takeovers to pursue the
acquisition strategy. Takeovers may enhance the personal wealth of managers, but
they may not be in the interests of shareholders. It is for this reason that boards have
to be extra diligent when overseeing managers who may be acquisition-minded. There
is greater risk of shareholder losses and managers, in effect, gaining at shareholder
expense. For this reason, the board needs to make extra sure the deals will truly
maximize shareholder wealth and not just provide financial and psychic income for

Mergers of Equals and Corporate Governance

MERGERS OF EQUALS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In mergers of equals, two companies combine in a friendly deal that is the product of
extensive negotiations between the management teams of both companies and espe-
cially between the CEOs of both firms. Research shows that bidders (normally the larger
of the two companies) do better in mergers of equals, while targets do worse when com-
pared with more traditional M&As. This was the case in a study by Wulf, who showed
that bidder shareholders enjoyed more of the gains in these types of takeovers.127 She
pointed to the negotiation process between the management and directors of the respec-
tive companies as being an important factor that explains why mergers-of-equals deals
have different relative financial effects for target and bidder shareholders.128 Wulf found
that the abnormal returns that target shareholders received were lower when target
directors received equal or even greater control of the combined entity! This result raises
corporate governance concerns. Are target directors, fiduciaries for target shareholders,
trading off returns for their shareholders just so they can gain positions in and control of
the combined entity? We have to also acknowledge that such positions come with com-
pensation that is important to these directors. If it were not important, they would be
serving for free, and that is not consistent with the way the corporate world is overseen.
Another very interesting finding of the Wulf study, and one that has important ram-
ifications for corporate governance, is that shared corporate governance was more com-
mon for larger and more poorly performing target companies and ones that were in
industries that were undergoing restructuring. CEOs of target companies that may not
have been doing well or that are in industries that are consolidating may pursue mergers
of equals so as to prevent a bid that might not provide them with any continued control.
They may see a friendly merger-of-equals deal as their best option, even though it may
be self-serving and not in the best interests of shareholders.
WORLDCOM: GOOD MERGER PLAN GONE OUT
OF CONTROL*
W
orldCom is an excellent example of a good M&A idea that was pushed too
far and ended up killing the company that was built through such mergers.
Mergers enabled the company to grow to a size where it could compete effectively
with the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S. market. At one time
WorldCom was one of the better M&A success stories. However, this great story of
corporate growth all came to a crashing end.

WorldCom’s M&A History
WorldCom traces its roots to a small telecommunications reseller called LDDS. The
telecom resale business grew in the wake of the breakup of AT&T, which allowed
other companies to come in and compete with the venerable telecom giant. At
that time, AT&T offered price breaks for bulk buying of minutes on the AT&T
long-distance network. Companies, including many small ﬁrms, would commit to
buying bulk minutes from AT&T and then passing along some of the discount
that they would receive to customers they would solicit. These customers would
be able to receive lower rates than they might get on their own. As a result, a
whole industry of resellers grew. However, such companies were limited in the proﬁt
opportunities they would enjoy as they would have to incur switching and access
costs at both the origination and end of a call. The reseller industry eventually grew
into subgroups, switchless and switch resellers, as some of the resellers purchased
their own switches so that they could avoid some of the costs they would incur
going to and from the long-distance network. The industry grew through M&As,
and one of the companies that used this method to grow was a Mississippi-based
reseller—LDDS Communications. The head of that company was Bernie Ebbers,
who was far from being a major ﬁgure in the deal-making business.
The idea for what would become WorldCom can be traced back to 1983, when
Ebbers and a few friends met at a diner in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, to discuss the
concept of forming a long-distance company now that the breakup of AT&T was
moving toward reality. Ebbers was initially an investor in the business, but he took
the reins when the company began to perform poorly. Within six months he took
this losing operation and moved it to proﬁtability. In doing so he showed that
he had the management skills to run a small business efﬁciently. Years later he
would demonstrate that these same management skills could not be translated to a
multibillion-dollar telecommunications business. Ebbers would show that he could
very effectively build a large company through M&As. However, when it came to
running such an enterprise proﬁtably, he failed.
The business went on to grow, and in 1989 it went public through an acquisition
with the already public Advantage Companies. As a result of this deal, LDDS now
had operations in 11 different states—mainly in the South and Midwest of the
United States. The next major step in LDDS’s history was a 1993 three-way deal
in which LDDS would merge with Metromedia Communications and Resurgens
Communications Group. Each of these companies was a full-service long-distance
ﬁrm. Ebbers had established momentum in his growth-through-M&As strategy, and
he would not be slowed. LDDS was still a small company compared with giants such
as AT&T and MCI. However, there was no denying the company’s meteoric growth
path. Ebbers continued on this path when on the last day of 1994 he completed the
acquisition of IDB Communications Corp., and on January 5, 1995, the acquisition
of the WilTel Network Services took place. The IDB deal moved LDDS more clearly
into the international telecommunications market as that company had more than
200 operating agreements in foreign countries. WilTel operated a national digital
ﬁber-optic network and was one of only four companies in the United States to
do so. Using this network, LDDS would be able to transfer some of its trafﬁc and
save outside network costs. With these deals LDDS then changed its name to
WorldCom, as it considered itself a major U.S. telecommunications company but
also a presence in the world telecom market. M&A had now helped the company
continue with its exponential growth, as shown in Figures A through C.

In December 1996, WorldCom completed its ﬁrst megamerger when it merged
with MFS Communications in a deal that was valued at approximately $14 billion.
This deal brought several valuable capabilities to WorldCom. For one, MFS had
various local networks throughout the United States as well as in Europe. For
another, the deal brought with it UUNet, which was a major Internet service provider,
thus expanding the package of services that WorldCom could offer customers.
However, Ebbers was not content to sit on his laurels. He was determined to make

WorldCom an industry leader. He continued in 1997 to seek out other merger
partners to help him fulﬁll this dream.
At the beginning of 1998, WorldCom completed three more deals. They were
the mergers with BrooksFiber, a company in the local exchange business, Com-
puserve, and ANS Communications Inc. Compuserve was acquired from H&R Block.
This sale by H&R Block was the undoing of a failed prior deal as H&R did not derive
signiﬁcant beneﬁts from its ownership of Compuserve. However, in the fall of 1998,
WorldCom announced a deal that would vault the company to a leadership position
in the world telecommunications business. In September 1998, WorldCom merged
with MCI in a transaction valued at $40 billion. By 1999, the company would have
revenues of over $37 billion—with the growth coming from M&As as opposed to
organic processes. As rapidly as the company was growing in the early 1990s, the
end of the decade made that progress seem modest (see Figure D). However, while
the revenue growth over the period 1995–1998 was impressive, proﬁts were not,
although they appeared to move in the right direction in 1999 (see Figure E).

The MCI deal put WorldCom on a new level. However, Ebbers was not satisﬁed
to stay put. His expertise was doing deals, and he sought out even more deals. He
reached an agreement to acquire Sprint in a $155 billion stock transaction. However,
right away antitrust concerns began to materialize. The market was skeptical that
the Justice Department would approve the acquisition, and this skepticism proved
warranted as in July 2000 the Justice Department stopped the deal. By this time,
however, the stock had already begun the slide from which it would never recover
until the company had to ﬁle for bankruptcy. Amazingly, Ebbers kept right on
doing deals. In July 2001, WorldCom announced that it was acquiring Intermedia
Communications.
While Ebbers seemed to keep trying to grow the company through deals
virtually right up to the end of his tenure with the company, an irreversible slide had
now begun (see Figure F). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), fresh
from dealing with major accounting frauds, such as Enron and Adelphia, now began
an investigation into WorldCom’s accounting practices. It questioned the company’s
revenue recognition and other accounting practices. It appeared that many of the
revenues and proﬁts that the company was booking were ﬁctitious. Ebbers was
forced to resign from the company on April 30, 2002. The demise of WorldCom
resulted in the largest corporate bankruptcy in history. From this bankruptcy a new
company, now called only MCI, would emerge (see Figure G).
What Went Wrong with WorldCom’s Strategy?
This is a very broad question. However, we can provide a short answer and say the
company and its CEO followed an excellent growth-through-mergers strategy. Prob-
ably all the way through the MCI deal, the strategy was working, although even then
some questions began to arise. Ebbers was great at doing deals and building up
his company to be a leading player in the world telecommunications business. The
telecommunications industry has natural economies of scale that can be exploited
through growth. His performance at achieving growth through mergers has to rank
up there with leaders in U.S. business history. So where did it all go wrong? It went
wrong in several ways. The obvious one was the accounting manipulations and other
alleged improprieties. However, from a strategy perspective, the problem was that
Ebbers and the company could not turn off the M&A acquisition binge. This really

was what Ebbers was good at. However, he also proved that he was not good at
managing a large company on a day-to-day basis. Reports of him micromanaging
minutiae at company headquarters are quite amusing, as the following passage
relates:
It was billed as a strategy meeting not to miss. WorldCom, Inc. senior executives
from around the globe gathered two months ago at the telecom giant’s headquarters
in Clinton, Miss. They had to come to hear CEO Bernard J. Ebbers reveal his grand
vision for rescuing a company mired in debt, sluggish growth, and rising controversy
about its accounting practices. What executives heard instead was their boss
thundering about the theft of coffee in the company’s break room.
How did Ebbers know? Because he had matched brewing ﬁlters with bags, and
at the end of the month, ﬁlters outnumbered bags. Henceforth, Ebbers commanded,
his executives would follow a checklist of priorities now referred to as Bernie’s seven
points of light. They would count coffee bags, make sure no lights were left on at the
end of the day, and save cooling costs in the summer by turning the thermostat up
four degrees, say three former and current executives. “Bernie is running a $40 billion
company as if it were still his own mom and pop business,” says one WorldCom exec
who attended the meeting. “He doesn’t know how to grow the company, just save
pennies.”a
Other reports state that Ebbers installed video cameras outside company
facilities to record the length of employee smoking breaks. Still other reports talk
about his approving expenditures above $5,000 and of personally reviewing all
press releases the company would issue. Running a large company was not what
Ebbers was good at. The skills that one needs to run a small company, or to do
creative and aggressive deals, are not the same skills that one needs to manage
a multibillion-dollar company. Indeed, with the exception of his grand-scale deal
making, Ebbers gave all the signs of being a small-company CEO. Managing a
business as though it were a small, closely held enterprise also contributed to
his personal woes. Prior to his resignation from the company, Ebbers borrowed
$366 million from the company to bail him out when personal loans he had taken
had come due and he would have had to sell some of his WorldCom shares at
a time when the price was not favorable. It is not unusual for CEOs of closely
held companies to cause the company to function for their own personal beneﬁt.
However, when a company is mainly owned by public shareholders, it has to be run
for the shareholders’ beneﬁt, and it is no longer the founding shareholder/CEO’s
personal ﬁefdom.
Ebbers and his management also did a poor job of managing the capital
structure of the telecom giant. The company had assumed signiﬁcant amounts of
debt that had by 2002 risen to $30 billion. In that year interest payments were
$172 million but were scheduled to rise dramatically to $1.7 billion in 2003 and $2.6
billion in 2004.b In addition, investment bankers were reporting that the company
had negative cash ﬂow in 2001. This was not a time to have a major increase in debt
service pressures when the company’s market shares and cash ﬂows were under
pressure. The company had over a billion in cash on hand and had a line of credit
with banks of up to $8 billion. However, credit lines regularly come up for renewal,
and a bank will reexamine a company’s liquidity position at such times. WorldCom
was heading for a liquidity crisis, and dealmaker Ebbers had no answer. The wrong
man was at the wheel, and he kept the company on course for disaster.
When it is clear that the company has gotten all it is going to get out of a
growth-through-M&A strategy, and the company is at an efﬁcient size, then the

deal-making process needs to be, at least temporarily, turned off. At that point
organic growth needs to be the focus, not more deals. The board let shareholders
down by not stopping Ebbers and putting in place someone else to run the business.
Ebbers was allowed to run the company right into bankruptcy. The outcome is a
sad one, as the growth Ebbers achieved was so impressive, but many will now know
him only for allegations of improprieties and the bankruptcy of the company. Who
knows what would have happened had the board been vigilant and asked him to
step aside before they got close to bankruptcy? Would a good manager have been
able to maintain and grow the business Ebbers built?
One factor that helped allow Bernie to stand unopposed was the fact that there
was no major blockholder who would stand up and insist that the board of directors
better represent shareholders’ interests. These failures can be contrasted with a
notable corporate governance success from many years gone by. The case is GM,
which was run by a CEO who shared many of the same positive and negative traits
of Bernie Ebbers. GM was built by the great dealmaker Willie Durant. His great skill,
like Ebbers’s, was doing deals and combining companies. Also like Ebbers, he was
not good at managing and could not create a management structure at GM that
would maintain proﬁtability in the face of frantic deal making. Unlike Ebbers, Durant
knew he had some shortcomings in managing, and he convinced the great Walter
Chrysler to postpone his plans to start his own company and to run GM instead.
However, Chrysler could not endure Durant’s disruptive and chaotic deal making
and left to form his own very successful auto company.
Fortunately for GM, it had an outspoken large shareholder, Pierre DuPont,
who insisted on making sure that the company would be proﬁtable—not just ever
larger. DuPont became convinced that Durant had outlived his usefulness and that
his constant deal making had to stop. He had a showdown with Durant in 1916.
By then GM was the second-largest auto company in the United States but was a
ﬁnancially troubled concern. DuPont insisted that Durant resign, and he replaced
him with the great manager Albert Sloan (after whom the Sloan school at MIT is
named). Ironically, Durant built one of the largest companies in the world but died
a poor man.
Lessons of the WorldCom Strategy
◾
Deal-making CEOs need to be controlled by the board. There will come a time
that deal making may need to be paused and possibly stopped. Acquisitive
CEOs need to be held in check. They also need to demonstrate that they can run
a company and do something other than acquisitions.
◾
Deal making and managing are two different skills. Some managers are capable
of doing both. Some are better at one than the other. Boards need to put in
place the right people with the right skills. Having a dealmaker in place greatly
increases the likelihood that deals will be made. If that is not what is needed,
then get someone else in the leadership position.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Joint Ventures and Strategic
Alliances
A
S WE HAVE SEEN, a merger with, or an acquisition of, another company can be
a costly endeavor but may provide great gains for the companies pursuing the
deal. It may also be the case, however, that many of the gains that the partici-
pantshopedtoachievecouldberealizedwithouthavingtodoamergeroranacquisition.
It may be possible that these gains can be achieved with a joint venture or a strategic
alliance. In this chapter we will explore these two options as alternatives to mergers and
acquisitions (M&As). We will consider their respective benefits and costs and then com-
pare these to M&As. We note that in certain instances, companies are better off with
an alliance or joint venture; but in other cases such deals will not achieve a company’s
goals, and it will have to focus on M&As.
As with our discussions of M&As, we will review the shareholder wealth effects of
both joint ventures and strategic alliances. Such studies of the market’s initial reac-
tion, like those of M&As, can provide great insight into whether a deal will ultimately
be beneficial.
CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS
Even before discussing joint ventures and strategic alliances, we should first consider
a simpler alternative to an alliance or joint venture—a basic contractual agreement
betweentheparties.Ifthegoalsoftherelationshiparespecificandcanbereadilysetforth

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
could be achieved by a long-term contractual agreement between the company and a
supplier. The company may not need to create a strategic alliance or a joint venture to
get a supplier to commit to providing specific products and services. However, when the
products in question are not readily available and require a specific development com-
mitment on the part of the supplier, a contract may or may not suffice. If the process
is even more complicated and involves the parties exchanging valuable and proprietary
informationaswellasabuyerprovidingfundingforthesuppliertoengageinalong-term
and uncertain development process, such as what often occurs between biotechnology
and pharmaceutical firms, then a contract may not be enough and either a strategic
alliance or a joint venture may be needed, if not an outright merger or acquisition. We
would expect to have a contractual agreement with a strategic alliance or joint ven-
ture, but most contracts between businesses are not strategic alliances or joint ventures.
Thus, strategic alliances and joint ventures involve agreements that go beyond the usual
contractual relationships with businesses. They are more complicated and require more
detailed roles and commitments between the parties.
COMPARING STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND JOINT VENTURES
WITH MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
Strategic alliances feature less involvement between the alliance partners than joint
ventures, which in turn require a lesser commitment than a merger or acquisition. Both
jointventuresandstrategicalliancesusuallyallowtheinvolvedcompaniestoparticipate
in the activity in question without loss of control over their own operations. In terms of
investment of capital, control, and the cost of reversal, Figure 14.1 shows that strategic
alliance is the lowest on this scale, followed by joint venture and then M&A.
JOINT VENTURES
In a joint venture, two or more companies combine certain assets and work toward
jointly achieving a business objective. Usually the time period of this combination is
defined and limited in duration. This is another difference between joint ventures and

M&As because the latter involves an indefinite period unless it is a specialized deal where
a company is acquired with the planned goal of selling it within a limited time period.
There are many recent examples of private equity firms buying public companies, tak-
ing them private with the goal of improving the business, and then putting them up for
sale at a higher price than they paid. However, in this chapter we consider very different
types of transactions.
The companies involved in a joint venture maintain their own separate business
operationsandcontinuetoexistapartastheydidbeforethejointventure.Thisventureis
then formally created as a business entity, such as a separate corporation or partnership.
A formal agreement among the venture participants sets forth the extent to which they
each will exercise control over the venture’s activities and will participate in the entity’s
profits or losses. Presumably, this will be a roadmap that each can follow to assess the
venture’s progress toward achieving its goals.
Joint ventures can be used for a wide variety of business purposes. Perhaps two com-
panies have specialized resources that when combined can be used to create or market
a specific product. For example, one could be a traditional pharmaceutical manufac-
turer, while the other might be a biotechnology firm. The pharmaceutical company may
want to utilize the research and development (R&D) resources of the biotech business to
develop a particular drug for the treatment of some ailment. If this is the goal, buying
the whole biotech business, which may be involved in many other areas in which the
drug manufacturers are not interested, may be an expensive way of gaining the research
capability it needs to develop the drug. The drug manufacturers may have in place a
widespread marketing network that would be able to rapidly capture market share when
the product is eventually developed. In this case, both parties bring resources to the
table and, for this one particular venture, each can gain from the other’s resources. The
solution may be a joint venture in which the two businesses come together for this one
activity and may not necessarily do anything else together in the future. Of course, if this
venture works out well, they might pursue other joint efforts.
Joint ventures offer a way for two potential merger partners to assess how well they
work together. Cultural differences between two companies might become apparent
when they are involved in a joint venture or strategic alliance. If these differences are
problematic, the business dealing usually can be curtailed at lower costs in a joint
venture or strategic alliance compared with a merger or acquisition that may erode
shareholder value.
Motives for Joint Ventures
Ifweconsiderthatamergeroracquisitionisacombiningoftheresourcesoftwodifferent
companies, then a joint venture is a different process that, to some extent, may achieve
the same goals. The motives for joint ventures are varied, but the following list provides
a few examples that often occur:
◾
Enhance research and development capabilities. A company, such as a pharmaceutical
company, may enter into a joint venture with another business that has some spe-
cific capability that it needs to further its R&D process. On the other hand, the R&D
capability may be so important that a company may want to “lock it up” and do an
outright acquisition.

538
◾
Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
◾
Gain access to key supplies. Two or more companies may form a joint venture so
they can have a better source of supplies for their production process. Such supplies
could range from joint exploration for oil by petroleum companies to joint training
programs for workers.
◾
Enhance distribution systems. Two companies may enter into a joint venture agree-
ment that will enable one or both of them to have an enhanced distribution network
for their products. One company could be a manufacturer of a product but lacks a
distribution system, including an established sales force, that the other possesses.
◾
Gain access to a foreign market. International joint ventures may enable companies
that operate in different countries to work together to achieve gains in one or more
countries. Such international joint ventures are common in the automobile indus-
try. An example occurred in 2017, when United Parcel Services teamed up with
the large package delivery company in China, S.F. Express, to form a 50:50 joint
venture—S.F. Holding Co. By joining forces with UPS, S.F. Express can better han-
dle the large volume of deliveries from China to other nations such as the United
States. The entity that was formed is based in Hong Kong, which is not far from
S.F.’s headquarters in Shenzhen.
Regulation and Joint Ventures
Simply because two companies form a joint venture instead of doing a formal merger
or acquisition does not exempt them from some of the same regulatory scrutiny they
might face if they merged or if one was acquired by the other. This is definitely the case
for antitrust laws. The anticompetitive provisions of the Sherman Act and the Clayton
Act can be also applied to joint ventures, where the effect of the venture on the market is
to reduce competition. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission chal-
lenge joint ventures less often than they challenge M&As. However, in theory the same
laws look at the business combination and its impact on the degree of competition in
the market. Keep in mind that when a company enters into a joint venture or a strategic
alliance, it cannot be doing so to circumvent antitrust laws, and those laws still apply.
Another point to remember is that if the antitrust authorities find a venture to be anti-
competitive, it usually can be terminated at a lower cost than a merger or acquisition of
a business that has been fully integrated into the parent company.
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Joint Ventures
In several sections of this book, we have examined the shareholder wealth effects
of corporation combinations. It was found that the market responses to acquisition
announcements are often not positive, and target shareholders often do not do well.
When target shareholders receive their premium, assuming it is not in stock and they
do not hold those shares for an extended period, they have measurable gains. In light
of these M&A shareholder wealth effects, the logical question that arises is, “How do
shareholders do in joint ventures?”

Joint Ventures

McConnell and Nantell did a study of 136 joint ventures involving 210 U.S.
companies over the period 1972–1979.1 The joint ventures were in a variety
of industries, with the most common being real estate development (13%) and
television and motion pictures (10%). The study was an announcement period,
short-term-oriented study that compares with many event studies that have been
conducted for M&A announcements. It is important to bear in mind, however, that
when we say short-term-oriented, the market is adjusting to the announcement in
the short term, such as during an event window of three days before and after a joint
venture announcement, but this adjustment reflects the market’s anticipation of the
long-term effects of the benefits and costs of the venture. The reaction occurs in a short
time period, but it is attempting to reflect or forecast long-term effects. This is different
from a long-term study, which looks at the financial impact of an event after the fact,
when we have had the benefit of the passage of a number of years.
The McConnell and Nantell study showed that shareholders in companies entering
into joint ventures enjoyed announcement period returns of 0.73%. They found similar
results when some of the industries, such as real estate, were removed from the sample.
They also found that the gains were fairly evenly distributed across venture participants.
When the authors tried to convert that seemingly small percentage return to a dollar
amount, they found it corresponded to an average value of $4.8 million.
The McConnell and Nantell study supports the idea that, when considering the
shareholder wealth effects, joint ventures are a viable alternative to a merger or an
acquisition. Whether they may accomplish what a company wants to achieve with
an M&A is going to be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, while they also
vary depending on the circumstances, one cannot argue that joint ventures lack some
of the aggregate positive shareholder wealth effects that M&As provide. One thing
that a joint venture will not provide, and for acquirers this is a good thing, is a large
buyout premium for target shareholders. Without that premium, the opportunities for
management to make bad decisions by overpaying may be more limited. They may still
be able to negotiate poor terms for their own companies, but the opportunities for large
financial losses may be more limited.
The McConnell and Nantell findings of positive shareholder wealth effects for
joint ventures were supported by the research of Woolridge and Snow, who analyzed a
sample of 767 announcements of strategic investment decisions involving 248 compa-
nies operating in 102 industries.2 These strategic investment decisions included joint
ventures as well as R&D projects and major capital investments. Their methodology
featured an examination of the stock market reaction to the announcement of these
decisions. In general, they found positive stock market responses to these various
announcements. When the sample was divided into subsamples for the different types

of announcements, they were able to determine that the shareholder wealth effects
were positive for joint venture announcements. These results are consistent with the
McConnell and Nantell findings.
Shareholder Wealth Effects by Type of Venture
While the McConnell and Nantell study looked at the shareholder wealth effects by type
of industry, it did not differentiate these effects by type of venture. Johnson and Houston
analyzed a sample of 191 joint ventures over the period 1991–1995.3 They divided their
sample into vertical joint ventures (55%) and horizontal joint ventures (45%). They
defined vertical joint ventures as transactions between buyers and suppliers. Horizontal
joint ventures are transactions between companies that are in the same general line of
business and that may use the products from the venture to sell to their own customers
or to create an output that can be sold to the same group. The results showed aver-
age positive gains from joint ventures equal to 1.67%. For horizontal joint ventures, it
appears that the gains are shared by the venture participants. The average returns for
verticaljointventuresweresomewhathigher—2.67%.However,whatwasparticularly
interesting when they looked at the vertical sample was that the gains did not accrue to
both parties. Suppliers gained an average of 5%, with 70% of the returns being posi-
tive while buyers received an average return of only 0.32%, which was not statistically
significant and of which only 53% of the returns were even positive. For vertical joint
ventures, the biggest winners were suppliers, who were able to capture the bulk of the
gains, while the market did not see major benefits for buyers.
Johnson and Houston recognized that when two companies entered into a joint
venture,especiallyaverticalventurethatshowedgreatergains,theventureparticipants
could have entered into a contract as opposed to a joint venture. Why did they choose
the venture alternative? Johnson and Houston analyzed a sample of announcements
of contracts and also found positive shareholder wealth effects with such announce-
ments. However, they found that companies enter into joint ventures, as opposed to
contracts, when transaction costs are high. They describe some of these transaction
costs as “hold-up hazards.” This could occur, for example, if a supplier had to make
buyer-specific investments, such as investments in certain machinery and capital goods
needed to produce the buyer-specific products. Although a contract may provide some
temporary protection to the supplier over the contract period, once this period is over,
the supplier may be vulnerable unless this capital equipment could be redeployed to
another buyer. For these types of transactions, Johnson and Houston saw benefits for
joint ventures that mere contracts could not provide.
Relatedness and Size
Consistent with the research on M&As that showed deals involving related compa-
nies yield better returns than deals with companies that were not related, Koh and

Joint Ventures
◾
541
Venkatraman found that the positive shareholder wealth effects from joint venture
announcements were greater for deals involving companies that were more related to
each other.4 In addition, they found that the smaller joint venture partner benefits more
than the larger one. This is a logical conclusion because for the smaller partner the
venture affects more of their business than the larger company, which may be involved
in more diverse areas outside the venture’s activities.
Restructuring and Joint Ventures
Sometimes a company may be able to pursue restructuring or a sell-off through the use
of a joint venture. Consider a company that wants to divest itself of a division but is hav-
ing difficulty finding a suitable buyer for 100% of the company that would provide a
sufficient value to make the company sell off the division. One alternative would be to
sell off part of the company and in effect run the division as a jointly owned entity. If the
goal of the company doing the partial sale is really to be able to do a 100% sale, it may
negotiate terms with the partial buyer, whereby that buyer would be able to purchase the
remaining shares in the division at some point in the future based on the occurrence of
certain events. Such events might be the division achieving certain performance goals.
If this occurs, the seller would, in stages, have found its buyer. That buyer is able to utilize
the capabilities of the business unit without, at least initially, having to do a 100% acqui-
sition. If it buys control of the target, it may be able to enter into whatever agreement it
needs while saving on the costs of a 100% acquisition. If it finds that the relationship is
rewarding, it may then want to be a 100% shareholder and not have to share in the own-
ership of the company. The seller may also be able to add terms to the original agreement
that state that if certain targets are met, the buyer is bound to complete the purchase and
buy the remaining shares as of some date.
Potential Problems with Joint Ventures
Many potential problems can arise with joint ventures. They are certainly not a cure
for all of the ills of M&As. This is obvious from the fact that we continue to do so many
M&As, and if joint ventures were the solution, we would see more of them instead of
M&As. The potential problems with joint ventures are as varied as the types of ventures.
They might fail because the venture partners do not work well together. There might be
disagreements between the participants, which might get in the way of accomplishing
the venture’s goals. The venture might require participants to share intellectual prop-
ertyorotherproprietaryknowledge,andtheymightbereluctanttodoso,oroneventure
partner might be using such information in a way that was not intended by the other
venture participant. The participants might not see themselves as fully committed as
they might if the activities of the venture were part of the overall business. This lack of
full commitment might prevent the venture from achieving its goals. Other problems
might be that the venture simply does not accomplish what it set out to accomplish. We
will see that many of these same problems can occur with strategic alliances as well.

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
STRATEGIC ALLIANCES
Strategic alliances are less formal associations between companies compared with joint
ventures. In a joint venture, a separate entity is often created, whereas in a strategic
alliance the agreement and the relationship are less formal. We can define strategic
alliances as collaborative efforts by two or more companies in which each company
maintains its own independence. Such alliances are strategic when they are formed to
facilitate the achievement of the company’s strategic goals. In a strategic alliance, two
or more companies share certain resources in a manner that is designed to be beneficial
for the alliance members.
An example of how unique strategic alliances can be occurred in 2017, when cable
companies Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications entered into a wireless part-
nership. As part of their deal, they each agreed to not do an acquisition of a wireless
company without the other’s consent. The agreement had a one-year duration. Being
able to offer wireless service on a large scale expands the bundle of services cable oper-
ators can offer customers. They also agreed to work together in other ways, such as
sharing know-how, to develop a larger-scale wireless business,
Strategic alliances are common in various different industries, including the phar-
maceutical, airline, and computer industries. Airlines that serve different geographic
markets often form alliances or airline partner agreements. Under such agreements,
theyremainseparateairlinesbutshareroutes.Thisenablesthemtobeabletokeepacus-
tomer who wants to fly beyond the range of a given airline’s routes. Each airline alliance
partner can market the entire route, and the same flights may be marketed under differ-
ent flight numbers for each partner. With such alliances, the various partners may be
able to provide customers with a global network. In addition, as various companies in
an industry form such alliances, this puts pressure on competitors to follow suit so they
are not at a disadvantage because of a smaller network.
Enhancing R&D is a major reason why companies form strategic alliances. Robin-
son reports a National Science Foundation study that indicated that 1 company in 10
that was involved in R&D financed such work outside of the company.5 Robinson and
Stuart also report a survey from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, which suggested that approximately “25% of the $26 billion in U.S.-based,
industrially financed, pharmaceutical R&D that occurred in 2000 took place in over
700 collaborative agreements with outside organizations.”6 An example of such an
agreement is the alliance between Novartis, a Swiss-based pharmaceutical company,
and Vertex, a biotechnology research company, whereby Novartis made various
payments, including an initial payment of $600 million and additional payments
of $200,000 staggered over six years, in exchange for the rights to market various

pharmaceutical products. With such agreements, pharmaceutical companies can gain
access to technology provided by biotech firms that may not be available to the drug
companies. As technological change accelerates in the pharmaceutical industry, the
methods of developing drugs also change. In recent years, the way in which phar-
maceutical companies create new drugs has changed, and many of these companies
have lacked some of the capabilities and expertise to conduct more modern research.
Drug manufacturers need access to research capabilities that biotech companies have
and that they may not be able to develop quickly in the time frame they need to stay
competitive with other drug companies, which may have such capabilities in-house or
through other alliances with biotech companies.
Governance of Strategic Alliances
When a company acquires another company, the governance process is hierarchical in
the sense that the acquirer pays for and receives the right to control the target. It governs
the target—hopefully, in a manner that facilities growth of the wealth of the acquirer’s
shareholders. The governance of strategic alliances is bilateral and is determined by
the agreement the alliance partners enter into as well as by factors such as the nonle-
gal commitment of the alliance partners to make the alliance succeed. In entering into
such an agreement, the alliance participants seek to lower some of the various costs
that might exist if they had a looser arrangement. This does not mean that they will
not have opportunities for strategic behavior. Depending on the type of alliance entered
into, a significant degree of trust may be needed between the partners. If the success of
the alliance requires that they share confidential information, then the parties must be
confident that this valuable intellectual property will not be used inappropriately. If this
proves to be a concern, it may inhibit the success of the alliance because the parties may
be reluctant to share what needs to be shared in order to have complete success.
There has been much discussion in the economic and financial literature on the
assignmentofcontrolrightsinjointventures.7 Thisassignmentisimportantinalliances
involving the development of new technologies. Aghion and Nobel Prize winner Tirole
point out that two factors should govern the allocation of control rights:
1. The degree to which there may be an underinvestment of either party that could
have an adverse effect on the success of the alliance.
2. The relative bargaining parties of the two partners.
We can add another factor as follows:
3. The extent to which one party may engage in opportunistic behavior, which can
have an adverse effect on the outcomes.

LernerandMergesdescribeacasestudyinvolvingpharmaceuticalcompanyEliLilly
and the Repligen Corporation, a biotechnology company. They worked together on a
project involving monoclonal antibody treatments of inflammation:
In the negotiations there were three areas where control rights were in dispute.
The first was the management of clinical trials: which drugs would be pursued
and when. A second was the control over the marketing strategy, an area in
which Lilly had extensive experience and Repligen only a slight acquaintance.
Finally, both parties wished to undertake the process of development and ulti-
mate manufacturing of the drug. Repligen, in fact, had recently acquired a cell
culture facility and the key personnel that went with it.
The final agreement appeared to assign control rights to the parties with
thegreatestdiscretiontobehaveopportunistically.Repligenwasallowedagreat
deal of flexibility in developing the lead product candidate (where it had the
greatest experience), but tangential product development activities would only
be supported when precise milestones were reached. Lilly was assigned control
over all aspects of marketing; while Repligen was assigned all manufacturing
control rights, unless it encountered severe difficulties with regulators.8
Lerner and Merges did an empirical study of 200 contracts/alliances between
biotechnology companies and sponsoring firms. They found results that were consis-
tent with the previous case study they described in their paper. They found that, in
general, control rights were assigned to the smaller alliance partner as an increasing
function of its financial health. It seems that in the drug development industry, it may
be optimal for control rights to be assigned to the smaller company, but the limiting
factor may be its own financial condition. Smaller companies that are in better financial
condition are in a stronger bargaining position and also are less risky alliance partners.
Larger pharmaceutical companies may be less able to force their terms on a financially
sound smaller biotech company. They also may have more confidence in a financially
sound but smaller biotech company and may worry less about its being able to do what
it agreed to do.
Alliance Knowledge Flows: Beneﬁts and Risks
One of the reasons why companies enter into strategic alliances is to jointly benefit
from specific knowledge resources of one of the partners. Often it is a situation where
a smaller partner possesses specific knowledge and expertise that is valued by a larger
company that may have the resources to transform this knowledge into profitable global
sales. The expectation that alliances actually do lead to knowledge transfers between
alliance partners is supported by empirical research. Gomes-Casseres, Hagedoorn, and
Jaffe found a greater incidence of citations of another company’s patents by alliance
partners who were applying for their own patents.9 They found these citations, their

measure of knowledge transfer, to be greater the more alliances the companies had and
to be less when they appeared to be “one-shot” deals.
One of the risks that smaller alliance partners face when dealing with a larger
company is that the larger company may seek to take advantage of the knowledge it
is receiving and may not fully share in the gains. One partner may use the knowledge
to compete with the other in its own markets. If this is done in an unlawful manner,
the smaller company is faced with having to pursue its rights in court, which can be
difficult and costly. However, the sale of equity interests may reduce those risks as it
lowers the entry incentive.10
Shareholder Wealth Effects of Strategic Alliances
Just as we have with joint ventures, we will look at the shareholder wealth effects of
strategic alliances. Chan, Kensinger, Keown, and Martin looked at the shareholder
wealth effects of 345 strategic alliances over the period 1983–1992.11 Almost one-half
of their sample involved alliances for marketing and distribution purposes. For the
overall group, they found positive abnormal returns equal to 0.64%. This is somewhat
comparable to what was seen with the research of McConnell and Nantell for joint
ventures. The Chan et al. study also found no evidence of significant transfers of wealth
between alliance partners. This implies that there was no evidence that one partner
was gaining at the expense of another. This result supports strategic alliances as an
alternative to M&As—in the limited circumstances where it is appropriate.
Shareholder Wealth Effects by Type of Alliance
Chan et al. looked at how the shareholder wealth effects varied by type of alliance.
They separated their sample into horizontal and nonhorizontal alliances. They
defined horizontal alliances as those involving partners with the same three-digit SIC
code. They found that horizontal alliances that involved the transfer of technology
provided the highest cumulative abnormal return—3.54%. This may help explain
why strategic alliances occur so often between technologically oriented companies.
Nonhorizontal alliances that were done to enter a new market provided a positive
but lower return—1.45%. Other nonhorizontal alliances failed to show significant
returns. Another study conducted by Das, Sen, and Sengupta also looked at the
types of alliances that might be successful, as reflected by their initial announcement
shareholder wealth effects.12 They were able to show how the announcement effects
varied by type of alliance as well as by firm profitability and relative size of the alliance
participants. They discovered that technological alliances were associated with greater
announcement returns than marketing alliances. These are two of the more common

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
types of alliances. In his research of 4,192 alliances, Hagedoorn had previously shown
that, as expected, technological alliances were more common in high-growth sectors,
whereas marketing alliances were more common in mature industries.13 Das et al. also
showed that the abnormal returns were negatively correlated with both the size of the
alliance partners and their profitability. We see that the market is concluding that larger
and more profitable partners will capture fewer of the gains from the alliance. Stated
alternatively, the market sees greater benefits for smaller and less profitable businesses
to partner with larger and more profitable companies. The smaller and less profitable
companies seem to have more to gain from strategic alliances. This does not imply that
the partnerships are not also good for larger companies. Given that they are bigger and
their profits are greater, it would be reasonable to expect that when such companies
partner with smaller firms, they have less to gain because that alliance will have a
smaller impact on the overall business of the larger company. That larger company may
enter into several such alliances, and the aggregate effect of all of these alliances may
make the difference less.
What Determines the Success of Strategic Alliances? Experience
What factors determine whether a strategic alliance is going to be a success? Which
types of alliances are more likely to be successful and which will be more difficult to pull
off ? A study that focused on this issue was conducted by Kale, Dyer, and Singh.14 They
analyzedasampleof78companiesthatreportedon1,572alliancesthathadbeenestab-
lishedforatleasttwoyears.Asofthestudydate,approximately12%oftheallianceswere

found that firms that had more experience with alliances were more likely to be success-
fulinfuturealliances.Thismeansthatthereisalearningcurve,andcompaniesdobetter
at alliances the more they do them. This result is intuitive. They also found that compa-
nies that had a dedicated alliance function, such as a department and department head
dedicated to overseeing alliances that the company entered into, were more likely to be
successful with their alliances. An example would be companies that have a vice pres-
ident or director of strategic alliances position. They found that Hewlett-Packard and
Eli Lilly, for example, had such positions. It would also be reasonable to assume that if a
given company established such a position, it would be more likely to engage in alliances
than companies that did not have one. The reported success rate of companies with
a dedicated alliance function was 68%, compared with a 50% rate for those without
these positions. Interestingly, the market reacted more positively for alliance announce-
ments for those companies that had such dedicated alliance functions (1.35% compared
to 0.18%). The other interesting product of this research is that it shows a consistency
between the initial market response and long-term results—in this case, as applied to

alliances. This is one of many pieces of evidence that allows us to take the results of
studies of the short-term announcement effects for various events, such as mergers,
acquisitions, joint ventures, and alliances, seriously because they seem to correlate well
with long-term research results.
Strategic Alliances Followed by Joint Ventures and M&As
Strategic alliances can be a way for the alliance partners to test the relationship between
the partners. The commitment level and costs are much lower than M&S and even joint
ventures. If the alliance is not fruitful or if the cultures are not compatible, then the
alliances are usually easy to terminate. However, if the parties are considering a more
involved commitment, such as a merger, then an alliance may be a way to “test the
waters.” This was confirmed by Marciukaityte, Roskelley, and Wang’s study of financial
service alliances.15 Consistent with other research, they found positive announcement
effects to the formation of alliances. They also found that following the alliances there
were improvements in operating performance relative to the industry. They also found
that alliance partners were more likely to enter into joint ventures or M&A with each
other than randomly selected firms. However, while these events were more likely ven-
tures, M&As still occurred only with a relatively small percentage of the alliances (5%).
Bondholder Wealth Effects of Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
We have seen that announcements of joint ventures and strategic alliances are asso-
ciated with positive shareholder wealth effects. This raises the question: What are
the effects on bondholder wealth? Chen, King, and Wen analyzed a sample of 2,964
announcements of joint ventures or strategic alliances over the period 1985–2011.16
The sample had a U.S. orientation in that the researchers required that at least one par-
ticipating firm be from the United States. They found an average two month abnormal
bond return of 0.64% for joint ventures and 0.70% for strategic alliances. They also did
not find any transfers of wealth between bondholders and equityholders. In addition,
they found that the main driver of these positive effects was synergies. Specifically, they
noted that financial synergy was the main driver of the positive effects in joint ventures.
This financial synergy could come from the provision of financial resources and the
reduction of financial constraints, which might enhance the overall level of investment.
In strategic alliances, the gains tended to come from operating synergy.
Jen, King, and Li extended this research to an international sample of 3,070 joint
ventures and strategic alliances from the period 2009–2015.17 They found a 1.53%
return to non-U.S. participants and a 1.38% return for U.S. participants. They also noted

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
NISSAN-RENAULT STRATEGIC ALLIANCE
T
he Nissan-Renault strategic alliance is one that has survived the test of time after
being formed in March 1999. Renault had previously been unsuccessful in pursing
an alliance with Volvo. However, the company was undaunted by this failure and
saw the opportunity to work with Nissan as potentially providing numerous beneﬁts,
including a signiﬁcant presence in the all-important Asian markets. Nissan, however,
was ﬁghting for survival under a mountain of debt it had assumed. It had previously
approached Chrysler, but the number-three U.S. carmaker declined the overture.
Given Nissan’s ﬁnancial pressures, one of the most fundamental contributions of
Renault was capital. It gave Nissan Motors $4.86 billion and $76.6 million to Nissan
Diesel. In exchange, Renault received a 36.8% equity stake in Nissan Motors and
a 22.5% stake in Nissan Diesel.a The agreement also allowed Renault to acquire
additional equity in Nissan at a later date. In addition, the leadership of Carlos
Ghosn, who was CEO of Renault and who also assumed the same position at the
troubled Nissan, cannot be understated.
Ghosn is one of the world’s leading automobile executives, and his leadership
was essential to the success of Nissan—a company that the world had doubts would
survive. Nissan’s managerial errors had caused it to assume a nonviable debt capital
structure, and it needed to totally change the way it managed the company. Under
Ghosn, they were able to do this and grow. He remained at the helm of these
companies until April 2017, when he stepped down and was succeeded by Hiroto
Saikawa.
The companies in the alliance are bonded together through a signiﬁcant cross
shareholding agreement. Renault holds a 43% voting equity interest in Nissan and
Nissan owns a nonvoting 15% interest in Renault. However, each company maintains
its own brands and separate corporate cultures.
The two companies work in various ways to not only stimulate sales but also
improve proﬁtability. They formed RNPO, which handles common purchasing, to
enhance the buying power of the two companies. In addition, each company
has strong powertrain expertise—Renault for diesels and Nissan for gasoline. The
alliance provided for each company to share this expertise with the other while
each company maintained the uniqueness of its own car offerings. In addition, the
alliance reduced the total number of engines they jointly used to eight through
selecting the best that each company had to offer.
Renault also adopted many of the Nissan production techniques in its plants.
They found that productivity improved 15% through the use of Nissan’s manufactur-
ing know-how. While prior to the alliance Nissan had several weaknesses, including
its poor capital structure, it had excellent manufacturing expertise and its cars were
well made. Through its association with Nissan, Renault was able to take advantage
of this expertise. Each company was also able to use the manufacturing facilities
of the other company, saving the costs of building new plants in foreign markets.
For example, Renault’s plants in Korea and Brazil make Nissan vehicles while Nissan
assembles Renault vehicles in its Spanish, South American, and Mexican plants.
The beneﬁts in growth and productivity for both companies better enabled

and corporate structures. The market still remains difﬁcult and the alliance alone is
not enough to enable them to succeed in trying times, but it gives each company
advantages they lacked prior to forming the alliance. For example, the alliance
markets several major auto brands, including not only Renault and Nissan but also
Inﬁniti and Datsun. In 2014, the alliance expanded through an agreement with
Daimler to develop premium compact cars and manufacture them in Mexico, where
Nissan already has production facilities. The plan is to market Inﬁniti as well as
compact Mercedes cars for the Central American market. This venture in Mexico
was the outcome of a 2010 agreement between Nissan/Renault and Daimler in
which each agreed to own 3.1% of the other.
In 2013, a third partner was added to the premium small car development
venture with the addition of the Ford Motor Company. Ford agreed to work with
them to jointly develop hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Valuation
T
HE IMPORTANCE OF A systematic valuation process became more apparent for
corporate America during the fourth merger wave, when many companies found
themselves the targets of friendly or unfriendly offers. Even companies that had
not been targets had to determine their proper value in the event that such a bid might
materialize. To exercise due diligence, the board of directors must fully and properly eval-
uate an offer and compare this price with its own internal valuation of the firm. The need
to perform this evaluation as diligently as possible was emphasized in the 1980 bid for
the TransUnion Corporation by Jay Pritzker and the Marmon Corporation.
In September 1980, Jerome Van Gorkom, chairman and chief executive officer of
TransUnion, suggested to Jay Pritzker that Pritzker make a $55-a-share merger bid for
TransUnion, which would be merged with the Marmon Group, a company controlled by
Pritzker. Van Gorkom called a board of directors meeting on September 20, 1980, on a
one-day notice. Most of the directors had not been advised of the purpose of the meeting.
The meeting featured a 20-minute presentation on the Pritzker bid and the terms of the
offer. The offer allowed TransUnion to accept competing bids for 90 days. Some directors
thought that the $55 offer would be considered only the beginning of the range of the
value of the company. After a two-hour discussion, the directors agreed to the terms of
the offer, and a merger agreement was executed.
The TransUnion directors were sued by the stockholders, who considered the offer
inadequate. A Delaware court found that the decision to sell the company for $55 was
not an informed business judgment:
The directors (1) did not adequately inform themselves as to Van Gorkom’s role in forcing
the “sale” of the Company and in the per share purchase price; (2) were uninformed as to

grossly negligent in approving the “sale” of the Company upon two hours consideration,
without prior notice, and without the exigency of a crisis or emergency.1
The court was also impressed with other deficiencies in the board of directors’
decision-making process. Among them was the fact that the board did not even have a
copy of the merger agreement to review at a meeting convened for the explicit purpose
of deciding on the merger. The board members therefore did not read the amendments
to the agreement, and they did not request an outside valuation study of the merger
offer.2 Based on these facts, the case seems to be one of clear negligence on the part of
the directors. However, there is evidence that the directors had conducted an analysis
of the value of the firm before the meeting in which they approved the offer. In fact, the
directors had been monitoring the firm’s financial condition for several years before
the Pritzker bid. Their defense also included the following factors.
The directors’ key defense was the “substantial” premium in Pritzker’s $55 offer
over TransUnion’s market price of $38 per share. The merger price offered to the share-
holders represented a premium of 62% over the average of the high and low prices at
which TransUnion had traded in 1980, a premium of 48% over the last closing price,
and a premium of 39% over the highest price at which the stock had traded at any time
during the prior six years. They offered several other defenses as well. First, the market
test period provided opportunity for other offers. Second, the board’s collective experi-
ence was adequate to determine the reasonableness of the Pritzker offer. Third, their
attorney, Brennan, advised them that they might be sued if they rejected the Pritzker
proposal. Lastly, there was the stockholders’ overwhelming vote approving the merger.3
The directors’ defense clearly had some merit, as reflected in the opinions of the two
dissenting justices, who saw adequate evidence that the directors had studied the value
of TransUnion for an extended period of time before the directors’ meeting and were in
a position to determine whether the offer was inadequate.
The board of directors also considered the comments of Donald Romans,
TransUnion’s chief financial officer, who had stated that the $55 offer was at the
beginning of the range within which an adequate value of TransUnion lay. Romans’s
analysis was prepared to determine whether TransUnion could service the necessary
debt to fund the leveraged buyout (LBO) he was contemplating. The court had not,
however, considered his analysis sufficient to approve a merger because it was not a val-
uation study. This ruling is significant because it affirms the need for a formal valuation
analysis in all mergers, acquisitions, and LBOs. Ultimately, then, the Smith v. Van Gorkom
decision is important because it set forth, under the business judgment rule, the respon-
sibilities of directors of public companies to have a thorough and complete valuation
analysis conducted by an objective party, such as an investment bank or valuation firm.
Following Smith v. Van Gorkom, even the more financially adept directors seek to get

themselves off the hook by having an outside valuation firm or investment bank issue
a “fairness opinion,” expressing their belief that the offer is adequate. What is also sig-
nificant about the Smith v. Van Gorkom decision was that the court was more impressed
with the decision-making process that the directors engaged in than with the ultimate
decision that they made. When compared with the usual standards to which merger
offers are held, such as the size of the merger premium relative to recent or industry
averages or what the offer price was relative to historical stock prices, the offer seemed
to be a good one for shareholders. The soundness of the decision was not enough for the
court, however, when it was the result of a process that the court found to be deficient.
In the wake of Smith v. Van Gorkom the demand for fairness opinions rose signifi-
cantly. While such opinions may help get directors off the hook, they raise their own
concerns. It is common that firms such as investment banks will issue fairness opinions
involving transactions from which they stand to profit. This raises concerns of conflicts
of interest. This is another area that M&A governance reform needs to address. In addi-
tion, fairness opinions really do not state that the price is the best value for the company.
Rather they state merely that the price is “fair.”
VALUATION METHODS: SCIENCE OR ART?
The methods and data considered in the valuation of businesses vary widely. In some
respects, business valuation is as much an art as it is a science. It is exact and scien-
tific in that there are standard methods and hard data to consider in the formulation of
valuation. However, several different methods may be employed in a given evaluation.
The methods may provide different business values and thus give the impression that
the general methodology lacks systematic rigor.
The naive reader may infer that the valuation of businesses may be an overly
subjective process. A closer examination of the methodology, however, reveals that
objective valuations can be achieved. The variability of values is natural, given that
we are considering the market for a business in which different participants may place
varied values on the same business or collection of assets because the anticipated uses
of these businesses or assets may be different in different hands.
In this chapter we will discuss the main methods of business valuation. We will con-
sider the methods that are used to value both public and private companies. Many of the
techniques used to value both types of companies are similar. For example, the selection
of the discount rate and comparable multiples is clearly relevant to valuing both public
and private companies. But some techniques, such as the marketability discount, may
be more relevant to the valuation of closely held businesses.
MANAGING VALUE AS AN ANTITAKEOVER DEFENSE
The intensified takeover pressures that managers can experience them a great incentive
to increase the value of their firms so as to reduce their vulnerability to a takeover. Firms

with a falling stock price but marketable assets are vulnerable to a takeover. Those with
highly liquid assets are even more vulnerable. Managers have found that adopting a
management strategy that will boost the stock price makes the firm a more expensive
target. With an increased stock price, raiders have trouble convincing stockholders that
management is doing a bad job and that there are more value-enhancing ways to run
the company.
An increase in stock price reduces the effectiveness of several takeover tactics. It
makes a tender offer more difficult by raising the cost of control, and it decreases the
effectiveness of a proxy fight because it is harder to garner the requisite number of votes
from other shareholders when management has increased the value of their investment.
Some supporters of takeovers maintain that the pressures placed on management have
benefited shareholders by forcing management to take actions that maximize the value
of their investment. The stock price has become a report card of management perfor-
mance. Managers must now regularly monitor the market’s valuation of their actions.
This marks a significant change in the way corporations were run in earlier years, when
managers kept the stock price in mind but did not make it a factor in most of their major
decisions. For this reason, among others, valuation has been placed in the forefront of
corporation management.
BENCHMARKS OF VALUE
The analysis presented in this chapter provides several different methods of valuing a
company. Their accuracy can be tested through a basic sensibility check, which can be
performed by comparing the resulting values with certain benchmarks that indicate the
floor value of the company. The floor value is the normal minimum value that the com-
pany should command in the marketplace. Some of these benchmarks are described in
the following sections.
Book Value
Book value is the per-share dollar value that would be received if the assets were liqui-
dated for the values at which the assets are kept on the books, minus the monies that
must be paid to liquidate the liabilities and preferred stock. Book value is sometimes also
called shareholders’ equity, net worth, or net asset value. Book value may not be an
accurate measure of a company’s market value. It merely reflects the values at which
the assets are held on the books. If these historical balance sheet values are not consis-
tent with the true value of the company’s assets (including intangible assets, such as
goodwill), book value will not be as relevant to the company’s valuation.
One use of book value is to provide a floor value, with the true value of the company
being some amount higher. The evaluator’s role is to determine how much higher the
true value of the company is. In some cases, however, the company may be worth less
than the book value. Although this is not common, a company may have many uncer-
tain liabilities, such as pending litigation, which may make its value less than the book

Benchmarks of Value
◾
555
value. Book value may also contain intangibles, such as goodwill, so it may also be useful
to look at tangible book value, which excludes such components.
Sales prices of companies can be expressed as multiples of book values. These mul-
tiples tend to vary by industry. Depending on the current trends in the industry, there is
a certain average value that can be used to gauge the current market price of potential
targets. If firms in the industry are priced at a certain average value, such as selling at
six times the book value, and the company in question is selling for only three times the
book value, this might be an indicator of an undervalued situation.
Equity Value
Equity value means the value of an ownership interest in a business. In a corporation
this value is usually represented by the value of its stock. If there is more than one call
of stock, equity value is the combined value of these classes.
The book value of the equity, discussed above, reflects a value that is derived from
the balance sheet as the difference between the book value of assets and the liabilities.
The market value of equity reflects how the market values the shares of a corporation.
This is also called market capitalization.
Enterprise Value
Enterprise value is the value of the entire business. It reflects the combined value of the
claims of equityholders and debtholders. All types of equity, preferred and common, are
included in equity value. When analysts think of the term enterprise value they are typi-
cally thinking of the market value of these equity claims. We will discuss how enterprise
value is computed later in this chapter.
Liquidation Value
Liquidation value is another benchmark of the company’s floor value. It is a measure
of the per-share value that would be derived if the firm’s assets were liquidated and all
liabilities and preferred stock as well as liquidation costs were paid. This value may be
different depending on whether the liquidation is being done under distressed conditions
or if it is a more orderly liquidation. In a distressed liquidation, assets may sell at fire-sale
prices.
Discounted Future Cash Flows or Net Present Value Approach
When the investment that is required to purchase the target firm is deducted from the
discounted future cash flows or earnings, this amount becomes the net present value.
This concept is similar to net present value calculations used for capital budgeting
(equation 15.1). These techniques are covered in most corporate finance textbooks.
The discounted future cash flows approach to valuing a business is based on pro-
jecting the magnitude of the future monetary benefits that a business will generate.
These annual benefits, which may be defined in terms of earnings or cash flows, are then
discounted back to present value to determine the current value of the future benefits.

556
◾
Valuation
Readers may be familiar with the discounting process from capital budgeting, where net
present value (NPV) is used to determine whether a project is financially worth pursu-
ing:
NPV = I0 −
n
∑
i=1
FBi
(1 + r) + · · · =
FBn
(1 + r)n
(15.1)
where:
FBi = future benefit in year i
r = discount rate
I0 = investment at time 0
For a business, the future benefits that are valued are net cash flows. These future
cash flows must be adjusted before constructing a projection so that the projected ben-
efits are equal to the value that a buyer would derive. For example, adjustments such as
the elimination of excessive officers’ compensation must be made to the base that is used
for the projection.
One of the key decisions in using the discounted cash flows (DCF) approach is to
select the proper discount rate. This rate must be one that reflects the perceived level of
risk in the target company. We will discuss the computation of discount rate a little later
in this chapter.
When we use DCF to value a business, we do the valuation in a two-part process.
Part one is to value the cash flows that have been specifically forecasted for a period over
which the evaluator feels comfortable about the accuracy of the forecast (this is known
as the discrete period). Typically this is five years in length. The second part of the process
values the remaining cash flows as a perpetuity. The value of these remaining cash flows
is sometimes referred to as continuing or terminal value. The longer the specific forecast
period, the smaller the continuing value. The value of the business (BV) is equal to the
sum of these amounts (equation 15.2):
BV = Value derived from the specific forecast period
+ Value of remaining cash flows
(15.2)
This value can then be computed as follows:
BV = FCF1
(1 + r) +
FCF2
(1 + r)2 + · · · +
FCF5
(1 + r)5 +
FCF6
(r−g)
(1 + r)5
(15.3)
where:
BV = value of the business
FCFi = free cash flows in the ith period
g = the growth rate in future cash flows after the fifth year

Benchmarks of Value
◾
557
The numerators of all the fractions are free cash flows. Note that after the fifth year
the values of all the future cash flows are measured by treating them as a perpetuity
that is growing at a certain rate, g. This perpetuity or future stream of cash flows of
indefinite length is valued using the process of capitalization. This process is explained
subsequently because it is also used as a separate method of valuing businesses. How-
ever, the first step is to project free cash flows for the sixth year. This may be done by
multiplying the fifth year’s cash flows, FCF5, by (1 + g). The resulting value is then
divided by the capitalization rate to obtain the present value of all cash flows from year
6 and thereafter. This is the value as of the beginning of year 6. We then compute the
present value of that amount by dividing it by (1 + r)5. This is the present value in year
0 of all future cash flows for year 6 and thereafter. This amount is sometimes referred to
as the residual. It is then added to the other five present value amounts computed for the
first five years to arrive at a value of the business.
Continuing or Terminal Value
The continuing value (CV) represents the value that the business could be expected to
be sold for at the end of the specific forecast period. We have measured this value by
treating it as a perpetuity and capitalizing the remaining cash flows, which we assumed
were going to grow at a certain growth rate. Another way to arrive at the continuing
value would be to apply an exit multiple. If we use an exit multiple for the continuing
value, we need to make sure it is a multiple that we expect to apply during the exit
period. For example, if a higher multiple is relevant as of the date of acquisition due
to the company being in an initial high-growth phase of its life cycle, perhaps a lower
multiple, consistent with mature firms in that industry, would be more relevant as an
exit multiple.
It should be noted that when measuring the continuing value using the perpetuity
calculation, the value that results is quite sensitive to the growth rate that is used. Differ-
entgrowthrateassumptionscanchangetheresultingvaluesignificantly.Asanexample
let us assume that the FCF at the end of the specific forecast period is $10 million and we
are using an 11% discount rate. Applying a 6% growth rate results in:
CV1 = $10, 000,000 (1.06)∕(0.11 −0.06) = $212, 000,000
(15.4)
If we used a growth rate lower by one percentage point, 5%, the resulting value is:
CV2 = $10, 000,000 (1.05)∕(0.11 −0.05) = $175, 000,000
(15.5)
The increase of one percentage point in the growth rate, from 5% to 6%, increased
the continuing value by 21% (remember this value still has to be discounted back to
year 0 terms). This is why the assumptions about the continuing growth of the com-
pany after the end of the specific forecast period are important to the overall value of the
company. As we will discuss in the Quaker Oats–Snapple case study, flawed growth rate
assumptions can result in disastrous overpayment.

QUAKER OATS’ ACQUISITION OF SNAPPLE
A
classic example of overpaying was the acquisition of Snapple by Quaker Oats.
In 1994, Quaker Oats had acquired Snapple for $1.7 billion. Just three years
later, in March 1997, Quaker Oats announced that it was selling Snapple for $300
million to Triac Cos. Now that is value creation for you! The market reacted positively
to this admission of an acquisition mistake when on March 27, 1997, Quaker Oats
stock closed at $37.75—up 25 cents.
How did Quaker Oats, a well-known and established company with major con-
sumer brands, make such a huge error? Clearly it overvalued Snapple and thought
that its growth, which before the acquisition had been impressive, would continue.
Snapple used its prior growth to demand a high premium, as it should have done.
Quaker should have more realistically evaluated Snapple’s growth prospects and
used a more modest growth rate when it valued the company.
At the time that Quaker made its rich offer for Snapple, many analysts ques-
tioned it and thought that Quaker was overpaying. The word at the time was that
Quaker might be overpaying by about as much as $1 billion. But Quaker was not
buying Snapple in a vacuum, and it was already successful in the soft or recre-
ational drinks business with its Gatorade line. Gatorade was and still is a successful
beverage and has carved out its own niche in this business that is separate and
distinct from giants such as Coke and Pepsi. To a large extent, Snapple had already
done the same thing. However, with the familiarity it already had with the beverage
business through its experience with Gatorade, Quaker Oats should have known
better. It would be one thing for Quaker Oats to have had no experience with this
business and make such a mistake. While that would not have made the misval-
uation excusable, Quaker’s experience in the sector makes the misvaluation even
harder to explain.
Quaker Oats is an established company with a 100-year history in business.
It has a diverse product line, which ranges from pancakes and cereals to juices
and sports drinks. Quaker had already done well with its Gatorade acquisition.
One author reported, however, that the success of this acquisition for Quaker’s
CEO, William Smithburg, was based on luck and impulsive decision making rather
than shrewd acquisition planning.a He was reported to have bought this company
based on “his taste buds” rather than a more serious market and valuation analysis.
Regardless of his reasoning, however, the Gatorade purchase was a big success.
The business cost Quaker $220 million, and it grew it into a $1 billion company.
Based on this success, Quaker’s board gave Smithburg more free rein for other
acquisitions, and it was here that both he and the board made an error.
The Quaker Oats–Snapple debacle was compounded by the manner in which
the deal was ﬁnanced. In order to raise the capital to afford the Snapple acquisition,
Quaker sold its “highly successful pet and bean divisions” to “raise $110 million
of the $1.8 billion price tag.”b It sacriﬁced a proﬁtable, albeit boring, business to
purchase an overpriced and mature business.
Triac was a company with its own acquisition history. It was run by Nelson Peltz
and Peter May. Peltz was well known in the world of M&As, having led Triangle
Industries, which was involved in some well-known leveraged transactions working
with Drexel Burnham Lambert and Michael Milken in the fourth merger wave.
Triangle grew from acquiring stakes in several can-making companies, consolidating

them, and eventually selling them to a French company for $1.26 billion. More
recently Peltz is known for his aggressive proxy ﬁght for a presence on the board of
Heinz Corp.
Quaker made more errors than just overpaying. After it bought Snapple, it
changed its advertising and marketing campaign. Before its sale, Snapple used
an odd set of advertisements that featured a Snapple employee named Wendy
Kaufman. When Quaker bought Snapple, it changed this campaign to one that
directly positioned Snapple behind Coke and Pepsi. This campaign, however, did
little to help Snapple grow enough to justify its rich price.
Quaker also did not understand Snapple’s distribution system, in which Snap-
ple’s distributors aggressively pursued unique deals to acquire shelf space. When
the bureaucratic Quaker tried to get Snapple’s distributors to convert some of their
shelf space to Gatorade, there was little ﬁnancial incentive for them to do so and
they didn’t.c
In 2000, Triac packaged together its beverage operations, which included
RC Cola, Mistic, and Snapple, and sold them to Cadbury for $1 billion plus the
assumption of $420 million of debt. This was a great deal for Triac when one
considers that it invested only $75 million in equity for Snapple and borrowed the
rest of the $300 million. The fact that Cadbury paid $1.4 billion for this business in
2000 is ironic in that it passed on the Snapple acquisition a few years earlier because
it believed that the business was too troubled to justify a much lower price than
what it eventually paid.d
Why did Quaker Oats overpay? One factor that is clear is that it believed
there was more growth potential in the Snapple business than what was really
there. To review the reasonableness of Quaker Oats’ assessment of Snapple’s
growth potential, one can consider the distribution into the market that Snapple
already enjoyed in 1997. Snapple had grown impressively before that year. It had
a high growth rate to show potential buyers. Buyers, however, needed to assess
whether that growth was sustainable. One way to do so would be to determine
how many more food outlets Snapple could get into and how much more product
it could sell at those that it had managed to get distribution into. Was it already
in most of the food stores that it would be able to get into in the U.S. market?
Could it really increase sales signiﬁcantly at the outlets it was already in? If it
was at a maturity position, in a noncarbonated beverage market that was growing
signiﬁcantly but where the growth was slowing, then this needed to be incorporated
into the valuation model, using either a lower growth rate for a DCF model or a
lower multiple for a comparable multiples model. That is, if historical growth rates
were extrapolated, this would result in an overvaluation. Obviously, Quaker Oats
was using inﬂated growth parameters when it signiﬁcantly overpaid for Snapple.

Adjustments to DCF Enterprise Value
In computing enterprise value using DCF, we are implicitly including only those
assets that contribute to the generation of free cash flows. If the company owns
other assets that have a positive market value but that do not contribute to cash flow
generation, then the value of these assets needs to be added to the enterprise value that
has been computed using DCF. An example is real estate assets that are not involved in
the operations of the business.
Arriving at Equity Value Using Enterprise Value
When we use DCF to arrive at enterprise value we compute the value of the equity by
deducting the value of the liabilities from the total enterprise value. However, we may
have to make other adjustments to the debt value that is found on the balance sheet.
Two areas of sometimes-significant liabilities that may not be on the balance sheet are
unfunded pension liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Deﬁning Free Cash Flows
Free cash flows are those cash flows that are available to all capital providers, both
equityholders as well as debtholders, after necessary deductions have been made for
the capital expenditures (CE) that are needed to maintain the continuity of the cash
flow stream in the future. These expenditures are made to replace capital that may have
been depleted through the company’s operating activities. While the term free cash
flows (FCF) has been defined differently by some users, many also deduct any necessary
changes in working capital (CWC) as well as cash taxes paid (CTP) (equation 15.6):
FCF = EBITDA −CE −CWC −CTP
(15.6)
Free cash flow reflects the cash from a business that is available to make payments to
shareholders and long-term debtholders. Therefore, it reflects the monies that generate
value for these investors.
Accuracy of Discounted Cash Flows: Evidence from Highly
Leveraged Transactions
Kaplan and Ruback conducted a study of 51 highly leveraged transactions (HLTs)
between 1983 and 1989, in which they compared the market value of the transactions
with the discounted values using cash flow forecasts in an effort to ascertain the
accuracy of the forecasts relative to the actual purchase price.4 Of the 51 transactions,
43 were management buyouts and 8 were recapitalizations. They found that the
median estimates of the DCF were within 10% of the market values of the transactions.
It is interesting that they compared the accuracy of the DCF forecasts with that of
other valuation methods, such as comparable multiples from transactions in similar

industries. The results showed that the DCF valuation performed at least as well, if
not better, than comparable methods. When they added the comparable data to their
model, however, the explanatory power of the DCF estimates improved. This suggests
that using information from both methods would result in better valuations than using
just one.
The importance of the Kaplan and Ruback study is that it reinforces the value of
DCF to other valuation methods while recognizing the utility of other methods, such as
comparables, in enhancing a valuation. It further affirms the validity of DCF methods
as they are currently used in the valuation of public and closely held firms.
Choice of the Discount Rate
The choice of the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future
projected cash flows requires that the riskiness of the target and the volatility of its cash
flows be assessed. As is true of other forms of capital investment, an acquisition is a risky
endeavor. We focus on the target’s cash flows as they reflect the value of the investment
that is about to be made by the acquirer. The discounting process gives us a means of
internalizing our judgments about the risk of an acquisition within the discount rate.
If a project were judged to be without risk, the appropriate discount rate would
be the rate offered on Treasury bills, which are short-term government securities with
a maturity of up to one year. Treasury bonds, the longer-term version of U.S. govern-
ment securities, may also have zero default risk, but they carry interest rate risk. Interest
rate risk is the risk that interest rates may rise above the rate that the investor receives
from the Treasury bond. Although the investor is guaranteed the predetermined inter-
est payments, these interest payments will not necessarily be invested at the same rate
of interest. If they are not, the investment’s proceeds will not be compounded at the
rate of interest offered on the Treasury bond.
The riskier the investment, the higher the discount rate that should be used;
the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the projected cash flows.
However, a firm methodology for matching the risk with the discount rate needs to be
established.

50% debt and 50% equity. The weights for each source are 0.50. If the debt rate is 9%
and the rate of return on equity is 15%, the cost of capital can be computed as follows:
CC = 0.50 (0.09) + 0.50 (0.15) + 0.045 + 0.075 = 0.12 or 12%
(15.8)

The target may have a very different risk profile than the acquirer. This is why the
target’s cost of capital may be more relevant to the computation of the discount rate
than the acquirer’s. This is then used as the discount rate for the firm when using DCF.
As the analysis is expanded to make the cost of capital reflect the true capital costs of the
firm, all the various components of the capital mix must be considered. Therefore, if the
firm has preferred stock outstanding as well as different forms of debt, such as secured
bonds, unsecured debentures, and bank loans, each needs to be considered separately
in the new, expanded version of equation 15.8.
Cost of Debt
The after-tax debt rate reflects the true cost of debt, given the fact that debt is a
tax-deductible expense. The after-tax rate of debt can be determined as follows:
kt = kd(1 −t)
(15.9)
where:
kt = the after-tax cost of debt
kd = the pretax cost of debt
t = the actual corporate tax rate for the firm
One question that often arises is what tax rate should be used to compute the
after-tax cost of debt. Some analysts simply use the statutory corporate rate since there
may be uncertainty as to what rate a given corporation may actually pay. However, it is
important to note that many corporations may pay a different rate. John Graham has
provided a methodology for how such rates can be determined.5
Cost of Preferred Stock
Because preferred stock dividends are usually fixed, preferred stock shares some of
the characteristics of debt securities. Therefore, preferred stock is often considered a
fixed-income security. The cost of preferred stock to the issuer can be determined by
first focusing on the dividends that have to be paid each period relative to the proceeds
derived by the issuer. These proceeds should be net of flotation costs. Let us consider a
firm that has issued 8% preferred stock with a par value of $100. Let us further assume
that flotation costs are 2.0% of the par value. This suggests a net of proceeds value
of $98. The annual dividends are $8, or 8% of the $100 par value. (Dividends are
annualized for simplicity.) The cost can be determined as follows:
Cost of preferred stock = Dp∕Pn = $8∕$98 = 8.16%

The consideration of flotation costs should also be applied to all publicly issued
securities. For the sake of brevity, we consider only flotation costs for preferred stock.
Cost of Common Stock
There are different methods that may be employed to measure the costs of equity capital
for a public company. One of the simplest methods is to calculate the historical rate of
return on equity for the stock over a given time period. A 5- to 10-year historical period
is often chosen. The time period selected would have to be placed in perspective by con-
sidering the corporation’s growth to see whether it represents the company’s current
and expected condition.
Whenweanalyzereturns,suchasequityreturns,theyaremeasuredonanafter-tax
basis. That is, they are after corporate taxes but before individual investor taxes.
If the company is a startup company with little available history, proxy firms may
be used. Proxy firms are similar to the company being analyzed, but they have more
historical rate of return data available. The rate of return on equity for proxy firms is
used in place of the company being analyzed.
Another method that is sometimes employed is the beta risk measure, which
is derived from the capital asset pricing model. This measure allows us to consider
the riskiness of the company and to use this risk level to determine the appropriate
rate of return on the company’s equity. The beta can be derived from the following
expression:
Ri = RRF + βi(RM −RRF)
(15.11)
where:
Ri = the rate of return on equity for security i
RRF = the risk-free rate; the Treasury bill rate is typically used as the risk-free
rate of interest
βi = the beta for security i
RM = the rate of return for the market
(RM −RRF) = the market risk premium
Beta is derived from a regression analysis in which the variability of the market’s
return is compared with the variability of the security’s return. Specifically, it is defined
by the following expression:
βi = cov (Ri, RM)∕var (RM)
(15.12)
where:
cov(Ri , RM) = covariance of the return on security i and the return on the market
var(RM) = variance of the return on the market

Valuation
From this analysis, a beta for the firm is computed, which can be used to weigh the
risk premium. This weighed risk premium is then specific to the firm being analyzed.
This method of measuring the cost of capital makes good conceptual sense but is not
commonly used in daily merger analysis.
Betas can vary depending on how they are computed and the data that are relied
upon in arriving at the value.6 One can arrive at a different beta for the same security
based on various factors:
◾
The length of the time period used for the historical data inputted into the model
◾
The specific market index used
◾
The time periods or frequency used for the historical data
◾
The specific risk-free rate used7
The betas that are computed for various companies are sometimes referred to as
leveraged betas since they reflect the capital structure of each company. Leveraged betas
reflect two factors that influence systematic risk: business risk as well as financial risk
that is a function of a company’s capital structure. If an acquirer is less concerned about
the target’s capital structure because it can install its own capital structure following
the acquisition, then a more useful measure might be an unleveraged beta. There are
various formulas that can be used to compute an unleveraged beta. One of these is the
Hamada formula, shown in equation 15.13.
Bu =
BL

We
(15.13)
Bu = unleveraged beta
BL = leveraged beta
t = tax rate for the company
Wd = percent debt in the capital structure

CAPM can be adjusted to try to come up with an equity rate that is relevant to non-
public targets and ones that have other risk factors such as smaller size. For nonpublic
targets,thebetamightbederivedfrom“comparable”publiccompanies.Totheestimated
return, an additional risk premium might be added to account for smaller-size other risk
factors to arrive at a “modified” CAPM process, as shown in 15.14.

where:
RPs = size premium (or other risk premiums)
The rate of return on equity can also be measured by directly projecting the divi-
dend flow. This calculation is easy in the case of preferred stock because the dividends
are generally fixed. Equation 15.15, derived from the Gordon model, demonstrates the
relationship between the stock price and dividends.
Ps = Di∕(ke −g)
(15.15)
where:
Ps = the price of the firm’s stock
Di = the dividend paid in period i (i.e., the next quarter)
ke = the capitalization rate for this stock
g = the growth rate of dividends
We can manipulate the preceding equation to solve for ke.
ke = Di∕P0 + g
(15.16)
Consider the example of a firm whose common stock is currently selling for $40 per
share. Annual dividends are $3, and the expected growth in dividends is 7% per year.
(For simplicity’s sake, dividends are considered annually, even though they may be paid
quarterly.) The capitalization rate can be calculated as shown in equation 15.17.
ke = $3 (1.07)∕$40 + 0.07 = 15%
(15.17)
The capitalization rate can be used as a measure of the firm’s cost of equity capital.
A simple guideline in deriving the cost of equity is to consider that the rate of equity
is generally 4% to 6% higher than the rate of debt. The rate of debt may be clear if the
firm does not have many different types of debt. In this case, the debt rate is given, and
4% to 6% can simply be added to derive the rate for equity.
Another way to look at the appropriate rate on equity is to consider the long-term
risk premium. This is the difference between the long-term average rate on risk-free
T-bills and the rate on equities. Historically, this has been between 6% and 7%. However,
there has been much debate regarding whether the appropriate risk premium should be
lower, given what some see as one-time factors and institutional changes that would
make the difference in return on these securities less in the future than it has been in
the past.8

Recent research by Haddad, Loualiche, and Plosser analyzed the role of credit con-
ditions and the equity risk premium as determinants of buyout activity over the period
1984Q4 through 2011Q4.9 They found that the equity risk premium explained over
30% of the total variation in buyout activity. This was three times greater than the vari-
ation which was explained by credit conditions.
Acquirer’s Hurdle Rate
In discussing the cost of capital, we have indicated that we would focus more on the
target’s costs of capital rather than the acquirer’s. However, the buyer may also want
to do the analysis using its own hurdle rate. This is the rate of return that it requires its
investments generate. This, in turn, may be equal to the acquirer’s own cost of capital.
One problem that arises in using such a rate is that if the target’s cash flows have a higher
volatility or risk than the acquirer’s, the use of the hurdle rate may not fully capture all
of the risk in the acquisition. However, this issue becomes somewhat moot if the two
companies operate in the same industry and have a somewhat similar risk profile.
HOW THE MARKET DETERMINES DISCOUNT RATES
Asshouldnowbeclear,nosetdiscountrateexists;manydifferentinterestratesareavail-
able to choose from. The overall market for capital consists of many submarkets. The
rate within each market is determined by that market’s supply and demand for capi-
tal. Markets are differentiated on the basis of risk level. For example, the market for debt
capital contains many different gradations of debt that vary according to their risk level.
The market for secured debt offers a lower rate of return than the market for unsecured
debt. Within each of the secured and unsecured categories are other gradations, each of
which has its own interest rate. The historical relationship between the broad categories
of capital can be seen in Table 15.1.

How the Market Determines Discount Rates
◾
567
Discount Rate and Risk
The greater the risk associated with a given earnings stream, the higher the discount
rate that will be used. If the projected cash flow or income stream is considered highly
likely, a lower discount rate should be used. For high-risk cash flow or income streams, a
risk premium is added, which increases the discount rate. The use of a higher discount
rate lowers the present value of each annual projected income amount.
Cross-Border Acquisitions and Risk
Investing in foreign countries brings with it a new element that varies depending on
the market. The acquirer may face the worry that the foreign government may take
actions that will limit the ability of the acquirer to access the cash flows that are gen-
erated in the foreign market. These actions range from changing tax rates to imposing
additional regulations to even nationalization of businesses. When governments are not
stable, potential acquirers may not be able to predict what type of government will be
in control over the life of the investment. An example of this occurred in 2012, when
Argentina seized control of YPF, which was an affiliate of the Spanish energy company
Respol. The seizure came after the company announced that its costly exploration efforts
had finally paid off.10
Research on cross-border versus domestic acquisitions confirms what one’s intu-
ition would suggest—that cross-border deals may present some unique opportunities
but they also bring with them unique risks that may even offset the returns. In ana-
lyzing a large sample of 4,430 acquisitions over the period 1985–1995, Moeller and
Schlingemann found that U.S. acquirers experienced significantly lower equity and
operating performance when they pursued cross-border deals compared to domestic
acquisitions.11 In addition, they found that stock returns responded negatively to global
diversification. Other research, as well as this study, has confirmed that stock returns
respond negatively to industry diversification.
Obviously, some countries are riskier than others. This needs to be a factor that is
incorporated into the discount rate. Markets that are in a state of transition, such as
India and China, can be hard to predict. Investments in less stable markets will usually
warrant a higher risk premium. Countries can increase the value of their businesses and
attract more foreign capital by lowering their risk profile, thereby enabling businesses to
better predict the cash flows they may expect to gain access to.
Changing Interest Rates and Acquisition Prices: Evidence from
the Fifth Merger Wave
Lower interest rates tend to result in lower discount rates. Short-term fluctuations
may not change the discount rate that one would use in a valuation, but changes in

long-term rates that persist for an extended period of time should have an influence.
Such was the case in the fifth merger wave, where interest rates fell and the average
price of acquisitions rose. This is demonstrated in Figures 15.1a and 15.1b, which
show that as the average yield on long-term Treasury bonds declined, the average
acquisition P/E multiple increased. Long-term Treasuries are used as a base to which a
risk premium is applied to arrive at a risk-adjusted discount rate. When interest rates
fall for an extended period of time, evaluators lower their discount rates, resulting in
higher acquisition values. This is not to imply, however, that interest rates are the only
factor determining acquisition prices. They are but one of several important factors
that need to be considered.

APPLYING THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW
METHOD OF BUSINESS VALUATION
T
his case study applies the discounted cash ﬂow method of business valuation
to a company that had $2.5 billion in sales in 2017. Sales are expected to grow
at declining rates of growth over the next ﬁve years from 10% in 2018 to a maturity
growth rate of 6% (g) after the ﬁfth year. For the purposes of this simple example,
we deﬁne free cash ﬂow as the difference between net operating income after tax
(NOPAT) and new net capital expenditures:
NOPAT = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT)(1 −Tax rate)
FCF = NOPAT −New net capital expenditures
The discount rate is taken to be the weighted average costs of capital for the
company, which this case study assumes is 12% (r). The capitalization rate that is
used to compute the terminal value of the company after year 5 is the difference
between this rate and the long-term growth rate:
WACC = r = 12% and k = Capitalization rate = r −g = 12% −6% = 6%
The enterprise value of the company is the present value of its future projected
cash ﬂows. This value is computed as the sum of the present value of the individually
projected cash ﬂows for the ﬁrst ﬁve years and the capitalized terminal value. This
value is computed as follows:
Terminal value = FCF6∕(r −g)
It is important to remember that this terminal value is itself a year 5 value
because it is the value of the company’s cash ﬂows that are projected to be received
after year 5. Therefore, it must be brought to present value by dividing it by the
PVIF applicable to year 5 or 1/(1.12)5:

Real Options in Valuation
In the past decade, the DCF analysis that is used in capital budgeting as well as in busi-
ness valuation came under attack for its lack of flexibility. Capital investments normally
carry with them various options or alternatives that may affect the value of the invest-
ment over their life. In the context of capital budgeting, these options, which allow for
modification of the value of an investment over time, are referred to as real options.12
Many options or alternatives are relevant to most capital investments, but some of the
more common are the options to postpone or delay, to grow, or even to abandon an
investment. In the context of M&As, the options could be postponing a proposed acqui-
sition or selling off all of a division. Capital projects typically also feature many different
growth options that allow a company to take steps and incur costs that may speed up or
slow the growth of the cash flows from a proposed deal. In an acquisition context, this
could involve a decision to invest capital in an acquired business in the hope that the
target’s growth can be increased.
In general, an option gives the holder the right to buy or sell an asset over a specific
time period. Readers may be more familiar with financial options, such as calls and puts,
which are traded on financial exchanges. Real options are those related to real assets as
opposed to financial assets. They come in a wide variety, such as those related to prop-
erty, equipment, intellectual property such as copyrights, licenses, and trademarks. In
the context of M&A we are referring more to options related to capital investment deci-
sions, including those related to whole businesses. This is why it is said that the M&A
process carries with it embedded options that can come in a wide variety, such as the
right to accelerate growth by combining businesses or terminating projects and selling
off divisions.
Simply creating one projection of future cash flows without considering the many
different options that can be pursued over the life of the investment or acquisition
presents a limited picture of the wide range of alternatives that can occur or could be
pursued. Theoreticians and practitioners in the field of capital budgeting have long
considered this limitation, and they have used various tools to try to augment simple
net present value computations. Smith and Triantis argue that discounted cash flow
models do not as easily capture the impact of potential M&A synergies that they assert
can be better dealt with using a real options approach.13
In an effort to arrive at business values that explicitly incorporate the alternatives
of various projected cash flows, researchers and practitioners applied models that are
derived from the Nobel Prize–winning option pricing model (OPM) used to value finan-
cial options. While the analysis today has reached quite sophisticated levels, the original
1973 Black-Scholes option pricing model (see equations 15.18 through 15.20) can be

BIG PHARMA ACQUISITION OF BIOTECH USING

L
et us assume that Big Pharma Corp. (BPC) contemplates the acquisition of a
medium-sized biotech company (BIOT) that conducts research in an area where
BPC sees great potential. Let us further assume that it has certain patent-protected
drugs (protection period assumed to be 15 years) that BPC expected to yield BIOT
impressive cash ﬂows and that DCF analysis shows that BIOT should have a value
of $500 million given these projected cash ﬂows and a weighted cost of capital
(WACC) of 12%.
However, BIOT demands a price of $750 million. BIOT argues that its research
into a speciﬁc new drug has a potential DCF value of $1 billion three years from
now if an investment of $1.2 billion is made. The management of BPC is quite
puzzled about why a seemingly negative NPV project in the future would give more
value to BIOT. In fact, BPC responds to BIOT that this news may cause it to lower,
not increase, its offer for BIOT. BIOT responds that the new drug DCF value has
a standard deviation of 70% and claims that this gives the required value to the
company as long as the three-year T-note has a yield of 5%. BIOT’s CFO explains to
BPC that this growth potential is analogous to a call option with a current value of
the stock of $1 billion discounted for three periods at 12% (BIOT’s WACC), which is
approximately $712 million. He proceeds to use the call model (see equations 15.18

to 15.20) where S is $712 million, the exercise price E is $1.2 billion, the maturity of
the option is three years, the risk-free rate is 5%, and the volatility is 70%.a Doing the
computation with these inputs, the CFO obtains a value for the growth potential of
BIOT of $253 million. Therefore, he maintains that the asking price of $750 million
is more than justiﬁed. BPC is not yet convinced of all the arguments, but it is willing
to take this valuation into consideration. After several rounds of discussions BPC
agrees to offer $650 million for the company with contingency valuation rights of
$100 million. This means that BPC will pay $100 million to the current shareholders
of BIOT if in three years the new drug goes into production. The BPC CFO is quite
pleased with how he structured the deal and thinks of himself as a clever ﬁnancial
engineer.
Across the ocean, La Grande Pharma (LGP) is looking at BIOT for its potential
to develop the new drug. Given the sure stream of cash ﬂow coming from existing
patents and the potential of the new drug, it is prepared to make an offer of $650
million for the company. Well versed in its market, LGP knows that BPC would still
be interested in buying BIOT in three years mainly for the current drug for which
it holds what LGP believes is a strong and defensible patent. LGP ﬁgures that BPC
would pay about $455 million for the company, representing the remaining value
over 12 years of the “annuity,” which would value the company today at $500 million
with a WACC of 12%.
LGP has a CFO quite versed in real option valuation (ROV) who recognizes that
having the right to sell BIOT after three years is akin to having a put option (equation

E of $455 million, and an overall volatility of the ﬁrm of about 50% (an average
between the existing product and the much greater volatility for the new drug). The
result is about $72 million. The CFO is thinking that the total offer for BIOT could
be as high as $720 million and makes an immediate offer to BIOT of $700 million
(see equation below and 15.19 and 15.20).

where:
P = put premium
S = stock price
X = exercise price
T = time to expiration
r = the interest rate
Since the discounted value of the $100 million that BPC is willing to offer is
today about $71 million, BIOT has now to decide if it likes the bird in hand ($700
million) or the one on the fence (about $720 million) along with the usual issues
and other concerns that comes from an acquisition. This case study is provided by
Professor Sorin Tuluca, Fairleigh Dickinson University.
a BPC ﬁnds this discussion curious but notes that BIOT’s CFO was a former ﬁnance professor
at a well-known academic institution, so it decided to “humor him.”

Valuation
Comparable Multiples
Comparable multiples are regularly used to value businesses. They are a quick and easy
method to come up with a value for a company. Like DCF, they can be used to value
both public and closely held businesses. There are three basic steps in using compara-
ble multiple analysis: (1) selecting the appropriate comparable companies, (2) selecting
the correct multiple, and then (3) applying it to the relevant earnings base. We will see
that there are abundant areas for judgment and subjectivity in the selection of these two
parameters.
Common multiples that are used are price-earnings multiples, so-called P/E ratios,
price-to-book, enterprise value to EBITDA, price to revenues, and other combinations.
Usually some normalized value of these measures is used, especially when the levels of
the values fluctuate greatly. Once the multiple is derived, it is then applied to either the
current year or an estimate of the next year’s value of the base selected. Perhaps the most
commonly cited multiple is the P/E ratio, which is the ratio of a company’s stock price
(P) divided by its earnings per share (EPS, or E for short). When we multiply a derived
P/E ratio by a target company’s EPS, we get an estimated stock price. For example, let us
say that we have analyzed 10 comparable companies and have found that the average
P/E ratio is 17. We can then multiply this value by the target company’s EPS, which we
assume in this example is $3: 17 × $3 = $41. When the multiples are derived from an
analysis of historical earnings, they are referred to as trailing multiples. When they are
based on forecasts of future earnings, they are called forward multiples.
Other commonly used multiples are EBITDA multiples—sometimes called cash flow
multiples because EBITDA is sometimes used as a proxy for cash flows. We usually obtain
EBITDA multiples by dividing enterprise value, including the sum of equity and debt
capital, by a given company’s EBITDA level. This is done for our group of comparable
companies to derive our average value. That value is then applied to the target com-
pany’s EBITDA value to obtain its enterprise value. We then back out the debt of the
target from this value to get the value of its equity.
Establishing Comparability
When we use comparable multiples, one obvious key issue is comparability. Are the com-
parable companies from which we derived the multiple truly similar to the target being
valued? Are they more valuable or less valuable? If, for example, the company being val-
ued is a troubled concern, then it may not be worth the same multiple of other, healthier
companies in the same industry. The target’s difficulties should be reflected not only in
a lower earnings base but also in lower comparable multiples, which might reflect lower
earnings growth in the future.
Comparable multiples are forward-looking measures. For example, a buyer may pay
seven times EBITDA, not for access to the past EBITDA level, but for future cash flows.
When the market establishes specific acquisition multiples for different companies that
have been purchased in the industry, it is making a statement about the ability of those
companies to generate future cash flows. When using such multiples, comparability is
key. It is more than just saying that a company being acquired shares the same North

American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and is in the same industry. It is a
more specific examination of comparability. Finding multiples for companies in the same
business as the target is a first step, not the final step, in the comparability process. Hav-
ing established a range based on prior acquisitions and the multiples that were paid, the
evaluator needs then to see how the target compares with those companies from which
the average multiple was derived. If the target has many features that would enhance
its future earning power, then perhaps a higher multiple should apply. It is likely that
the buyer is aware of this and may be asking for such a multiple. If it is not, either the
buyer is naive or this assessment of higher-than-average future earning power may be
misguided.
The Delaware Chancery Court has held that there must be a reliable basis for estab-
lishing comparability.14 One of the ways this can be done is through specific research. In
Global GT LP v. Golden Telecom the court rejected the use of comparable multiples due to
the fact that neither expert presented a reliable basis for establishing comparability and
neitherhad detailed knowledge of the relevant industry and thecompaniesinparticular.
Dealing with Outliers
Users of industry multiples should know which companies entered into the computation
of the average. It is useful to be aware of the degree of dispersion. It may be the case that
many of the companies in the industry have multiples very different from the average.
If one or two outliers have skewed the average, then we need to consider whether they
shouldbeeliminated.Iftheoutliersareverydifferentfromthecompanybeingevaluated,
then there may be a good case for eliminating the outliers from the computation of the
average.
USE OF COMPARABLE MULTIPLES TO DETERMINE
ENTERPRISE VALUE
E
nterprise value is a broad measure that reﬂects the value of the capital, both
debt and equity, that has been invested in the company. In this case study,
we will measure enterprise value using comparable multiples derived from similar
businesses that have been sold before the current valuation. As previously noted,
comparable multiples are applied to speciﬁc performance measures. Some common
performance measurements are as follows:
EBITDA: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
EBIT: earnings before interest and taxes
Net income: earnings after interest and taxes
Free cash ﬂow: operational cash ﬂow less capital expenditures

We can apply this multiple to the ﬁnancial results of the Wilson Company, the
target acquisition, to determine an approximate value to be assigned to the Wilson
acquisition (see Figure C). It should be pointed out that the results of Wilson’s
historical ﬁnancial performance should be adjusted for nonrecurring or unusual
items, which are not anticipated in the future. The valuation results in an enterprise
value of $33.2 million and an equity value, after deducting liabilities of approximately

Using P/E Multiples
P/E multiples are a very often cited measure of value. Like other multiples, such as
EBITDA multiples, one needs to be aware of the subtleties. As noted before, we can
have trailing or forward multiples. When using multiples to value a business, we need
to make sure that they are applied to permanent income. This is income that excludes
nonrecurring, one-time earnings. For example, gain from sales of assets may not be
relevant to future performance and should be excluded. As discussed earlier, we also
need to differentiate between trailing and forward multiples. In the context of P/E
multiples, a trailing multiple would be a recent stock price divided by earnings in the last
full accounting period, such as the last year. A forward multiple would be the current
stock price divided by forecasted earnings. Such forecasts may be either projected by
the evaluator or derived from a commercial source. However, for companies that have
had stable earnings, constructing a forecast by applying the company’s own historical
earnings growth to the last year’s earnings level may provide a usable forecasted value.
Keep in mind that multiples vary by industry. This is intuitive as industries vary
in their expected earnings growth. Table 15.3 shows selected P/E acquisition multiples
for different industries. We can see that there is a significant degree of cross-industry
variation.

MATTEL’S ACQUISITION OF THE LEARNING
COMPANY: OVERPAYING THROUGH FLAWED DUE
DILIGENCE AND POOR STRATEGY
T
he case of Mattel’s acquisition of the Learning Company is a classic example
of overpaying caused by poor due diligence and a ﬂawed strategy. Mattel is a
major player in the toy business and markets leading brand names, such as Barbie.
The company grew into this leadership position partly through a series of strategic
acquisitions. This included acquiring major toy companies, such as Tyco Toys and
Fisher Price. These horizontal acquisitions of competitors expanded the company’s
product line while increasing its market share.
In 1997, a new executive took the helm at the toy company—Jill Barad. She
quickly gained notoriety and became one of the better-known female executives
in the United States. Her fame peaked when she appeared on the cover of Busi-
nessWeek. After taking control of the toy company, she began to pursue her own
acquisitions, and in 1999 committed the company to buy a very different type of
business. Mattel paid $3.5 billion for the Learning Company, which was in the edu-
cational software business. The idea behind the strategy was that toys are becoming
more computerized and the products that the Learning Company marketed were
sold to a similar audience as Mattel’s product line sold to. Skeptics were concerned
that the similarities between the product lines of the two companies were hard to
see. This was conﬁrmed in 2000 when Mattel sold off the Learning Company for
virtually nothing. The business had lost money for Mattel and, when overall poor
performance forced the company to refocus, the company decided to cut its losses
and part ways with the Learning Company.

Marketability of the Stock

579
VALUATION OF THE TARGET’S EQUITY
In conducting a valuation of a public company, the value of the debt is usually a fairly
straightforward exercise. The valuation of the target’s equity is the more challenging
part of the process. For public companies, however, there is a market for the target’s
stock, and the values that a company’s stock trades at in this market may be helpful in
determining the value that should be paid for a target’s equity in an acquisition. How-
ever, the bidder would not simply adopt the current price at the time an offer is being
made. Several adjustments might have to be made. One would be a time variation adjust-
ment that simply addresses the fact that the current price might not be representative of
the long-term historical prices at which the stock traded. It could be that the market is
in a temporary downturn. The bidder may want to use the temporarily low price, but it
is unlikely that the seller would accept this. The difference between the near-term his-
torical average price and the current price would provide some room for negotiations
between the parties. In addition, the price of the stock at a moment in time does not
reflect a control premium that normally accompanies acquisition offers.
MARKETABILITY OF THE STOCK
The marketability of common stock varies considerably. The equity of publicly held
companies that is traded on large organized exchanges, such as the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), is generally considered quite liquid. However, more and more, much
stock trading has left the NYSE, which at the start of the 2000s handled about 80% of
all U.S. trading. That percentage has now fallen below just under 21.7%. That share
has been taken by other exchanges as well as private trading venues and dark pools. The
liquidity of stocks that trade in these other locations can vary significantly.
The market on which the security is traded is an important consideration in the
valuation process. The broader the market and the greater the daily trading volume,
the more liquid the security. This means that if you want to sell the stock, you have
a better opportunity to sell a larger amount of stock without depressing the price
significantly when it is actively traded on an organized exchange. If the stock is a
seldom-traded security on the OTC market, however, the price quoted may be less reli-
able. The exact value of the stock may not be determinable until offers for the block have
been made.
The “thinness” of the market is a major determinant of the liquidity of the security.
Lack of liquidity is another element of risk that must be factored into the stock price. The
liquidity or marketability risk can be factored into the risk premium that is used to value
the projected cash flows.
Market thinness can be judged by looking at the number of float shares—the num-
ber of shares available for trading. Small companies on the OTC market may have only
a small percentage of their shares traded, whereas most of the shares may be rarely
traded. When the number of float shares is small compared with the total shares out-
standing, the valuation provided by the market may not be very useful. Moreover, when

580
◾
Valuation
the number of float shares is small, any sudden increase in trading volume can greatly
affect the stock price. This is another element of risk that needs to be considered.
A related influence on the price a buyer may be willing to pay for a security is the
concentration of securities in the hands of certain groups. The companies traded on
theOTCmarketfrequentlyhavelargeblocksofstockconcentratedinthehandsofasmall
group of individuals. Some of these companies may be firms that have recently gone pub-
lic and have large blocks of stock owned by family members. European companies, for
example, tend to have a much higher percentage of shares held by large blockholders
such as founding families. Such a concentration makes the likelihood of a successful
takeover by an outside party less probable unless it is a friendly transaction. The greater
the concentration of securities in the hands of parties opposed to a takeover, the more
problematic and costly a takeover may be.
Data Reliability and Fraudulent Inaccuracies
Perhaps the worst scenario for acquirers is fraudulent misrepresentation of earnings.
This was the case when Cendant Corp. reported in 1998 that its earnings were
overstated. As discussed in Chapter 10, Cendant was a franchisor of Ramada hotels,
Coldwell Banker real estate, and Avis Rent A Car, and a marketer of membership clubs.
It was formed with the December 1997 merger of HFS Inc. and CUC International Inc.
The company was forced to report that CUC International deliberately inflated revenues
and decreased expenses. Among the issues raised was the treatment of revenues from
offered memberships for which customers may ask for a full refund. In its restated
data, the company reported revenues reflecting a high 50% cancellation rate. Various
estimates of the inflated profits ranged from $500 to $640 million. The deliberate
falsification of financial statements is an acquisition nightmare scenario. Cendant
survived this accounting debacle. It was a one-time event that the market understood
and thought the company could overcome. The market was less sanguine about the
company’s diversification strategy, and the company eventually relented and agreed to
break itself up into separate component companies.
Role of Arbitragers and Impact on Prices
When a company is rumored to be the object of a takeover, the target’s stock becomes
concentrated in the hands of risk arbitragers, which are institutions that gamble on the
probability that a company will eventually be taken over. When this occurs, the holders
of the shares, including the arbitragers, will receive a premium. As arbitragers accu-
mulate stock, upward pressure is put on its price. As we discussed in Chapter 6, these
arbitragers also sell shares of the target short, knowing that research shows the stock
price of bidders often declines when acquisitions are announced.
The net effect of the arbitrage buying is to increase the target’s price while also
increasing the probability that the company will be taken over. As we have discussed
in Chapter 6, the likelihood of a takeover is increased because now more shares will
be concentrated in the hands of fewer investors, making large block purchases easier.
In addition, given that arbitragers are simply looking to realize a good return on their

investment as quickly as possible, they are very willing sellers if the price is right. A com-
mitted buyer, therefore, can be aided by risk arbitrage activities.
Equityholder Valuation Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions
Numerous studies have considered the valuation effects of mergers and acquisitions.
Many of these studies were done in the early 1980s. Their results, however, also apply to
later time periods. Some more recent research, such as studies that consider the magni-
tude of returns over longer time periods as well as studies that look at the impact of the
medium of exchange on returns, is discussed later in this chapter.15
Many of these research studies consider the impact of bids over a relatively
short-term window, which may be several months before and after a bid. Proponents
of the positive effects of mergers contend that it takes many years for the bidder’s
acquisition plans to come to fruition. Researchers, however, responded that the market
has the long-term experience of many prior acquisitions and that it draws on this
information when evaluating bids. In addition, it is difficult to conduct long-term
studies that filter out the effects of a specific transaction from many events and other
transactions that may occur over a longer time period. Nonetheless, there are some
that look at various financial measures over an extended time period after deals.
These studies on the valuation effects of M&As have five general conclusions:
1. Target shareholders earn positive returns from merger agreements. Several studies have
shown that for friendly, negotiated bids, target common stockholders earn statisti-
callysignificantpositiveabnormalreturns.16 Thesourceofthisreturncanbetraced
to the premiums that target shareholders receive.
2. Target shareholders may earn even higher significant positive returns from tender offers.
Target common shareholders of hostile bids that are tender offers also receive sta-
tistically significant positive returns.17 The hostile bidding process may create a
competitive environment, which may increase the acquiring firm’s bid and cause
target shareholder returns to be even higher than what would have occurred in a
friendly transaction.
3. Target bondholders and preferred stockholders gain from takeovers. Both target preferred
stockholders and bondholders tend to gain from being acquired.18
15 It is important to note that the fact that research studies may be dated several years earlier does not mean
thattheirfindingsnolongerapply.Itisdifficulttopublishresearchthatusesasimilarmethodologyandreaches
the same conclusions as studies published a decade earlier. Generally, only if their findings differ in some sig-
nificant aspect will journal referees and editors accept a new version of prior research.

Valuation
Given that bidders tend to be larger than targets, the addition of the bidder and
its assets as another source of protection should lower the risk of preferred stocks
and bonds, thus making them more valuable. Like the target common stockholder
effects, this is an intuitive conclusion.
4. Acquiring firm shareholders tend to earn zero or negative returns from mergers. Acquir-
ing firm stockholders tend not to do well when their companies engage in acquisi-
tions. (Note: This is an average response, but there are many examples of positive
responses.) These effects are either statistically insignificant or somewhat negative.
Presumably, this reflects the fact that markets are skeptical that the bidder can enjoy
synergistic gains that more than offset the fact that it is paying a premium for the
target. The fact that the bidder’s stock response is small compared with that of the
target is due to the fact that bidders tend to be larger than targets.
5. Acquiring firm shareholders tend to earn low or no returns from tender offers. Returns to
acquiring firm shareholders following hostile bids are not impressive. There is some
evidence that there may be a response that ranges from mildly positive to zero.
Acquiring Firm Returns and Deal Anticipation
Research has showed that bidder returns are often zero or negative although sometimes
they are positive. Research has shed light on some of the reasons for this variation. These
returns can be related to the state of M&A in an industry. Cai, Song, and Walkling ana-
lyzed a sample of 3,389 acquisitions over the period 1985–2001 and found support for
the bidder anticipation hypothesis.19 That is, they found that bidder returns were related
to the length of the period of time when there was no M&A in a given industry (dor-
mant period). The greater the surprise, the higher the bidder returns. They found that
the first bidder in an industry that had no M&A for a minimum of a year enjoyed positive
announcement returns of 0.69%. The returns to all bidders were much lower (0.18%)
and were not statistically significant. The returns to the next bidders were even lower
and also not significant when the dormant period was less than one year.
Another explanation for these effects could be first-mover advantage. Cai et al. dis-
count this explanation as they failed to find a negative response for shares of rivals.
Bondholder Valuation Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions
Having looked at how M&As have different effects on shareholder wealth of acquirers
and targets we now consider the impacts of M&As on bondholders. Billet, King, and
Mauer analyzed a large sample for M&As with valid bond return data over the period
1979–1997.20 They found that high-yield bonds issued by targets earned positive
returns, and they attributed this to the coinsurance benefits these bondholders derived
from being part of a combined firm. Target bondholder returns were higher when the
target’s rating was below that of the acquirer.

Takeovers and Control Premiums
◾
583
Acquiring firm bonds earned negative returns. The various effects on targets and
acquirers were more pronounced in the 1990s than they were in the 1980s. These
results are quite intuitive.
What Types of Acquiring Firms Tend to Perform the Poorest?
Given that many acquiring firms often perform poorly in M&As, the question arises
as to what types of firms do the worst and which do better. Rau and Vermaelen
analyzed a sample of 3,169 mergers and 348 tender offers between 1980 and 1991.21
They compared glamour firms—companies with low book-to-market ratios and high
past earnings and cash flow growth—with value firms—companies with higher
book-to-market ratios and poorer prior performance. The results of their research
showed that glamour firms underperformed value companies. They attribute the rela-
tively poorer performance of glamour firms to factors such as hubris. They also noted
that glamour firms tended to more frequently pay with stock. This is understandable
because their stock is more highly valued than that of value firms.
TAKEOVERS AND CONTROL PREMIUMS
When a company makes a bid for a target’s stock, one way to assess the offer is to exam-
ine the magnitude of the control premium. There is a major difference between the price
of a single share quoted on an organized exchange and the price of a 51% block of stock
that will give the buyer effective control of the company. When a buyer buys a control-
ling interest in a target company, it receives a combined package of two “goods” in one:
the investment features normally associated with ownership of a share of stock and the
right to control and change the company’s direction. Control allows the buyer to use
the target’s assets in a manner that will maximize the value of the acquirer’s stock. This
additional control characteristic commands its own price. Therefore, the buyer of a con-
trolling block of stock must pay a control premium.
The comparative value of a controlling interest relative to a minority interest can be
seen by examining the data in Table 15.4 and Figure 15.2. In each of the years shown
(1982–2016), the controlling interest commanded a higher value, although, as with
the P/Es shown in Table 15.3, there is a good deal of cross-industry variation.
The magnitude of acquisition premiums is often attributed to a combination of the
bidder’s estimate of the acquisition gains and the strength of the target’s bargaining
position. The acquisition gains may come from a variety of sources, including antici-
pated synergistic benefits derived from combining the bidder and the target, or the target
being underpriced or poorly managed. The bidder’s bargaining position may also be
affected by several factors, including the presence of other bidders and the strength of
the target’s antitakeover defenses. Varaiya analyzed the role of these various factors in
determining acquisition premiums in 77 deals between 1975 and 1980.22 He found

ing Firms,” Journal of Financial Economics 49, no. 2 (August 1998): 223–253.

Takeovers and Control Premiums

significant support for the role of competitive forces in the auction process and anti-
takeover measures in determining premiums but mixed results for the role of anticipated
benefits.
Premiums and Target Size
Companies acquire targets of direct sizes. When considering premiums an obvious
question is, do companies pay different premiums based upon target size? One could
theorize that if a target has some valuable technology or intellectual property, such
as in the case of a biotechnology company that a large pharmaceutical company was
considering acquiring as it thought it could vault the potential sales of the target’s
products far above what the target could achieve, then an extra-high premium could be
justified. Alexandridis, Fuller, Tarhaar, and Travlos analyzed a large sample of deals over
the period 1990–2007 and found that, as expected, bidders tend to pay lower premiums
for larger targets.23 A higher premium may be acceptable for a larger company to
pay, as the added premium may not be that sizable an amount of money. Plus, smaller
targets typically are easier to integrate and smaller deals are less risky. Larger targets
are harder to integrate and may be more risky for several reasons, including the fact
that the acquirer is making a more substantial investment.
Premiums and Mergers of Equals
Are premiums appropriate in mergers of equals? If the transaction is a combination of
two companies of roughly similar size and when neither of the two is really acquiring the
other, an argument can be made that there is no basis for a premium. The 1998 merger
of GTE Corp. and Bell Atlantic (later Verizon) is a good example. If the transaction is
considered an acquisition by Bell Atlantic, GTE shareholders were understandably dis-
appointed when they received only 1.22 shares of Bell Atlantic for each share of their
company, as GTE shares closed at $55.13 shortly after the deal was announced, whereas
BellAtlanticsharesclosedat$44.32.WhenoneconsidersthefactthatGTEhadahigher
P/E, a faster revenue growth rate, and a share price that was as high as $64, the offer
was not impressive from GTE’s point of view. GTE management, however, defended the
deal as a “merger of equals.”
This view is consistent with the Delaware court’s position that stock-for-stock merg-
ers are not changes in control. Based on this legal view, a control premium may not be
in order.
The debate of whether a control premium is warranted came to a head in the
wake of a lawsuit brought by Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., which was a
large shareholder in Chrysler Corporation. The 1998 merger between Chrysler and
Daimler Benz was termed at the time as a merger of equals.24 However, particularly as
the financial troubles at Chrysler became apparent, Daimler proved to be the dominant

party. Chrysler executives were supplanted by Daimler managers, who took control
of the former Chrysler operation. Kerkorian sued because he considered the deal a
takeover, and as such, he and other shareholders were entitled to a takeover premium.
The court, however, failed to agree with his position.
Mergers of Equals: Do Managers Trade Premium for Power?
One of the moral hazard problems that exists in merger negotiations, which is especially
true for mergers of equals, is that at the time the CEO of the target is supposed to be
negotiating the best deal for shareholders, he is also negotiating his own best compen-
sation package and position in the combined company. Julie Wulf analyzed a sample
of 53 mergers of equals over the period of 1991–1999.25 She found that indeed CEOs
do trade power for premium in such negotiations. These results were supported by a
study by Hartzell, Ofek, and Yermack, who showed that, in deals where target CEOs
enjoyed extraordinary personal treatment, shareholders received lower acquisition pre-
miums.26 This creates the disquieting concern that target CEOs are trading premium for
their shareholders in exchange for their own personal enrichment.
Does the Market Value Control Independent of Takeovers?
Having cited the abundant evidence supporting the existence of a control premium in
takeovers, we should determine whether control provides a premium in the absence
of takeovers. In a study designed to measure the premium paid for control, Lease,
McConnell, and Mikkelson sought to determine whether capital markets place a
separate value on control.27
The Lease study examined the market prices of common stocks of 30 companies
with classes of common stock that pay identical dividends but differ significantly in
their voting rights. One group had substantially greater voting rights on issues related
to the control of the firm, such as the election of directors. The two groups of securities
provided the same opportunities for financial gain and differed only in their voting
rights and the opportunities to control the company’s future. Their results showed
that for 26 firms that had no voting preferred stock outstanding, the superior voting
common stock traded at a premium relative to the other classes of common stock. The
average premium they found was 5.44%. It is important to remember that this is not
inconsistent with the premiums cited previously because these other premiums are
found in takeovers. This is expected, however, because the companies included in the
Lease study were not involved in takeovers.
Four of the 30 firms considered in the study showed that the superior voting
rights common stock traded at a discount relative to the other class of common stock.

Takeovers and Control Premiums

These firms differed from the other 26, however, in that they had a more complex
capital structure that featured preferred stock with voting rights. Given the existence
of this type of voting preferred stock, these four firms are not as comparable to the
other 26 clear-cut cases. Another study that focused on specific industries, such as the
banking industry, found control premiums in the range of 50% to 70%.28
Corporate Governance and Takeover Premiums
Does shareholder control in a target company affect the premiums such companies get
in takeovers? One could theorize that a higher degree of control by certain shareholders,
such as managers, should increase takeover premiums, as such shareholders would take
the necessary actions to ensure that they receive the highest premium for their shares.
However, one could also anticipate that controlling shareholders could oppose takeovers
so as to preserve their control and managerial positions.
Thomas Moeller found that in the 1980s, the period of the fourth merger wave,
target shareholder control and takeover premiums were negatively related.29 How-
ever, the relationship between these two variables was a positive one when we get to
the 1990s and the fifth merger wave. He interprets his results to imply that direct
shareholder control in the hands of large blockholders can have a positive effect
on premiums, because such shareholders push to get the highest return for their
investments. However, high shareholder control by managers, such as the CEO, can
have the opposite effect on takeover premiums, as other factors, such as continuing in
the position as the CEO, may carry more weight with the CEO.
Impact of Prices on Takeovers
Intuition and Economics 101 imply that if a given target’s stock is priced lower by the
market, its probability of being taken over is greater. Indeed, we have a large group of
activist hedge funds that search for companies with valuable assets and possibly bad
management where the stock price has fallen. They often accumulate shares in such
companies and agitate for changes, such as the sale of the company. In light of this, it
has been difficult to reconcile various research studies that have failed to support the
proposition that lower market valuations increase takeover probability.
Cremers, Nair, and John as well as Bates, Becher, and Lemmon found a negative, but
statistically insignificant relationship between takeover probability and the Tobin’s q of
companies.30 Companies that generate higher values with the assets they have may be
less vulnerable to a takeover.

Valuation
More recently, Edmans, Goldstein, and Jiang have shed light on the complexity of
the relationship between target stock prices and takeover probability.31 They explained
that the prices of potential targets are endogenous in the sense that when a stock price of
an otherwise valuable company falls, the market recognizes that it is becoming a more
attractive takeover target; this by itself may increase demand for the shares, thus off-
setting some of the price decline. When we consider this, we then also have to recognize
that managerial underperformance can have a significantly greater negative effect than
what is apparent by merely looking at the company’s stock prices, as some investors may
have offset some of the negative impact that this underperformance had by buying the
shares in anticipation of an eventual takeover. In other words, if management is under-
performing, the weakness in the company’s stock price will fail to reflect the full extent
of that underperformance.
VALUATION OF STOCK-FOR-STOCK EXCHANGES
In this section we will go through a basic discussion of valuation in stock-for-stock
exchanges. Prior to beginning our discussion of valuation, we need to address some
background issues.
Tax Incentives for Stock versus Cash Transactions
The tax laws provide that stock-for-stock exchanges may be treated as tax-free reorga-
nizations.32 This means the stock that target stockholders receive will not be taxed until
the shares are sold. Target stockholders are thus able to postpone being taxed on the
consideration that is received for the shares in the target company until the new shares
in the acquirer are sold. One tax disadvantage of a reorganization is that the acquirer
may not utilize other tax benefits that would be allowable if the transaction were not a
reorganization, such as if it were financed by cash. If the transaction were not a reor-
ganization, other tax advantages, such as the ability to step up the asset base or utilize
unused tax credits that the target might possess, would be available. It is also possible
to receive debt in exchange for the target’s shares. For example, the target stockholders
could receive debt as part of an installment sale of the target. In this case, the deferred
payments are not taxed until they are actually received.33 The seller can accumulate
interest, tax-free, on the unreceived portions of the sale price.
Risk Effects: Stock versus Cash

and other costs of the acquisitions. In a stock deal, the shareholders of both companies
share the risk that the deal will be successful.
SHAREHOLDER WEALTH EFFECTS AND METHODS OF
PAYMENT
The choice of compensation paid by the acquirer to target shareholders can itself have
important ramifications for the shareholders of both companies. We will see that these
effects differ depending on whether we take a short- or long-term perspective.
Target Companies: Short-Term Effects of Method of Payment
Research studies show that the target company valuation effects are greater for cash
offers than for stock offers. For example, using a sample of 204 deals, Huang and Walk-
ing find that cash offers are associated with substantially higher target returns before
and after controlling for the type of acquisition and the amount of resistance.34 They
attribute the higher premiums of cash offers to tax effects. That is, they conclude that
higher premiums are required by shareholders who demand them because they will be
forced to incur the costs associated with cash-financed acquisitions. Huang and Walk-
ing’s finding regarding the higher premiums of cash offers has been confirmed by later
research.35 It is interesting that in a sample of 84 target firms and 123 bidding firms
between 1980 and 1988, Sullivan, Johnson, and Hudson found that the higher returns
associated with cash offers persisted even after offers were terminated. They interpret
this as the market reevaluating firms that are targets of cash offers and placing a higher
value on them as a result of the cash offer. When a bidder shows interest in a target, this
tends to enhance the market’s valuation of that company. It may also attract other bid-
ders to make an offer. This is one of the reasons why bidders request that targets enter
into no-shop agreements prior to their making an offer. They know that if they make
an offer, they may create additional value in the target, and they do not want the target
to use the value the bidder created against the bidder by inviting other newly interested
bidders to compete against the original offeror. New bidders who would be competing
against an original cash offer will usually have to also respond with a cash bid as they
might be at a competitive disadvantage if they offered securities (depending on the par-
ticular issuing company and securities offered).
Acquiring Companies: Short-Term Effects of Method of Payment
As noted previously, acquiring companies tend to show zero or negative returns in
response to announcements of takeovers (with many exceptions). Chang analyzed the
34 Yen-Sheng Huang and Ralph A. Walkling, “Target Abnormal Returns Associated with Acquisition
Announcements,” Journal of Financial Economics 19, no. 2 (December 1987): 329–349.

short-term announcement effects on acquiring firms that pursue takeovers of public
and privately held companies while also considering how these effects differed for cash
versus stock offers.36
Using a sample of 281 deals from 1981 to 1992, Chang found that abnormal
returns were approximately zero and not statistically significant for cash takeovers of
public companies, whereas returns were a positive and statistically significant 2.64%
for stock offers. For private firm takeovers, returns were not statistically significant for
cash offers but were a statistically significant –2.46% for stock deals. In conclusion, he
found that for cash offers, returns were basically zero and did not vary, depending on
whether the deal was a public or private acquisition. However, the positive stock price
reaction to takeovers of private companies is in sharp contrast to the negative response
for public company takeovers. One theory that explains this result is that there may
be more monitoring when stock is given to a few owners of the closely held company.
This greater monitoring may reduce adverse agency effects and increase value. When
the market perceives this, it reacts with a positive stock price response. This conclusion
is consistent with other related research on the influence of managerial holdings and
those of institutional investors and other blockholders.
Acquiring Companies: Long-Term Effects of Method of Payment
The Chang finding of zero returns for cash offers was contradicted by Loughran and
Vijh, who found positive abnormal long-term returns for cash acquisitions but nega-
tive abnormal return for stock deals.37 A major difference between the two studies is
that Loughran and Vijh viewed their results from a long-term perspective while Chang
focused on short-term announcement effects.
Loughran and Vijh found that over the five-year period following acquisitions,
stock deals averaged negative excess returns equal to –25%, whereas for cash tender
offers the returns were an average abnormal return of a positive 61.7%! This is a sizable
difference. Ghosh’s research also provides some support for the long-term effects of
the Loughran and Vijh study. He found that performance, as measured by total asset
turnover, improved for cash acquisitions but performance measures such as cash flows
declined for stock deals.38 However, when he controlled for the size of the combined
companies, which become larger after the deals, the performance difference of stock
versus cash deals disappeared. In cash transactions, the firms were larger than those
in the stock deal subsample. Ghosh attributes improvements to the larger size of the
postacquisition cash deals compared with stock transactions, which involved relatively
smaller combined companies.

Stock Mergers: Do Overvalued Acquirers Create Value for Their
Shareholders?
The research we have discussed paints a negative picture of the shareholder wealth
effects for acquiring firm shareholders. However, there are important exceptions to this.
Shleifer and Vishny have pointed out that overvalued companies have incentives to use
their equity to acquire valuable targets.39 In doing so, they are able to convert their
overvalued shares into hard assets by acquiring other firms. Probably the best example
of this was the acquisition/merger of Time Warner by AOL, in which AOL was able to
use its temporarily overvalued shares to basically acquire Time Warner and its valuable
businesses.
When a company’s stock is overvalued, it would be reasonable for the market to
correct this overvaluation. This creates a problem if one is studying the success of deals
overvalued acquirers do because it would be natural for the acquirer’s stock price to
fall after the deal due to the correction of the overvaluation. Savor and Lu analyzed a
sample of 1,773 deals (with 1,050 stock and 723 cash) over the period 1978–2003,
which they used to analyze the deals that overvalued acquirers do.40 They found out
that the greater the overvaluation, the greater the incentive to merge. They also com-
pared two sets of overvalued firms: one group that completed their deals and comparable
firms that were not able to complete the deals due to factors such as failure to secure
regulatory approval. They examined whether the stock price effects were more negative
for the failed acquirers. Indeed, they were. They found that abnormal returns for failed
acquirers underperformed their successful counterparts by 13.6% one year out, 22.2%
for a two-year horizon, and 31.2% for three years! The unsuccessful acquirers suffered
weak abnormal returns after the bid collapsed, as the market seemed to voice its recogni-
tion that the stock was overvalued and that the company had lost an opportunity to use
its temporarily overvalued “currency” to gain value through M&As. For the successful
acquirers, they were able to exchange their overvalued shares for hard assets, and the
market responded positively to this move compared to those that were not successful in
completing their “exchanges.”
Cash-Rich Firms and M&As
In recent years, U.S. corporations have been holding increasingly large amounts of cash,
with the value reaching $2.5 trillion. There are several reasons for this. One is that com-
panies have been generating significant cash flows as the economy expanded but some
of them are reluctant to make long-term investments as they remain risk averse due to
the prolonged effects of the subprime crisis and the Great Recession. Certain companies,
such as Apple and Microsoft, were recipients of huge cash flows and do not have compa-
rable investment opportunities for all of these funds. Many of these firms have increased

Valuation
their share buybacks. However, another prime reason for retaining their cash holdings is
the high corporate tax rates in the United States, which has caused multinational com-
panies to hold cash outside the United States as they await the possible changing of the
tax rate.41
One logical question is: Do cash-rich firms do more M&As? Harford found that
this is indeed the case.42 He also found out that such cash-rich firms tend to conduct
value-destroying acquisitions. They also tend to do more diversifying acquisitions.
Surprisingly, later research by Pinkowitz, Sturgess, and Williamson found that
cash-rich firms were 23% less likely to make cash, as opposed to stock, bids.43 This is
counterintuitive.
Method of Payment and Managerial Ownership
When the shareholdings of a bidder are concentrated so that certain shareholders con-
trol a significant percentage of the shares and votes of the target, these holdings will be
diluted if the bidder issues more shares to finance a bid.44 Several studies have focused
on verifying the extent to which the distribution of holdings is related to the use of stock
financing of deals. In a study of 209 M&As in the early 1980s, Amihud, Lev, and Travlos
found that the choice of stock versus cash was significantly and negatively related to the
size of the shareholdings of managers and directors of the bidder.45 Their results show
that the higher the managerial stock equity ownership, the less likely a company will
do stock offers. Ghosh and Ruland then extended this work to a sample of 212 M&As
over the period 1981–1988.46 They also found that managerial ownership of the bid-
der was negatively related to stock financing of deals. However, the research in this area
does not find a linear relationship between stock financing and managerial ownership.
Martin, researching a large sample of 846 public but also private acquisitions over the
period1978–1988,alsoconfirmedtheinverserelationshipbetweenstockfinancingand
managerial ownership over intermediate ranges of ownership.47 He found that this inter-
mediate ownership range is between 5% and 25%. When acquiring firm management
has low or high ownership percentages, managerial ownership is not related to stock
financing. For low ownership, managers did not have much control to start off with,
so a dilution of the level they had would not change their position significantly. Simi-
larly, when management has a relatively high level of control, it might still be able to

command significant control even after the holdings are somewhat diluted through the
issuance of stock to effect an acquisition.
The Ghosh and Ruland study also considered the relationship between manage-
rial ownership of the target and the form of payment in deals. They found that stock
deals were positively related to the high managerial ownership for the target corpora-
tion. They also found that when managerial ownership was high and when the deal
was a stock deal, target managers were more likely to stay in the employ of the company
after the transaction. We will elaborate on this result a little later in this chapter. As it
relates to this discussion, Ghosh and Ruland found that target managerial ownership
was the more important factor in determining the form of consideration in bids. Thus, it
seems that when target management holds a significant percentage of the target’s stock,
it influences the method of payment and can demand shares, instead of cash, for these
holdings. This implies that they are concerned about influencing control of the com-
bined company, which in turn may better ensure their own employment in the future.
When we consider that premiums are often higher in cash deals, target management
seems to be considering control along with other factors, such as the tax treatment of
the transaction, not just the immediate cash premium management might otherwise
receive. Obviously, situations will differ. Some owners of closely held businesses might
prefer cash as they seek to liquidate their investment and retire. Even in such situations,
however, buyers may require that the prior owners stay involved and are able to only
gradually cash out their investment.
Method of Payment, Managerial Ownership, and Executive Job Retention
Managers of acquiring companies who value control may want to avoid stock deals
because such deals may dilute their control.48 If this is the case, it may be reasonable to
assume that the owners of target companies who value control may prefer stock instead
of cash. As noted earlier, Ghosh and Ruland found a positive association between the
likelihood of a stock financed acquisition and the managerial ownership of target firms.
They also found that managers in target firms were more likely to retain their positions
whentheyreceivedstockasopposedtocash.Whentryingtounderstandthisresult,keep
in mind that hostile deals are more likely to be financed with cash as opposed to stock.
Cash has a clearly defined value and does not have the potential valuation and liquidity
drawbacks that securities offers may have. In general, a sample of cash offers will tend
to include more hostile deals than a comparable sample of stock-financed deals. How-
ever, hostile bidders will more likely remove target management than friendly bidders.
When target management holds a significant number of shares, the bidder has to work
to get them to accept the offer. This acceptance will more likely be given when the offer
comes with features that meet these shareholders’ wants. For target management this
may mean staying in the employ of the company after the takeover. When they receive
stock in the combined company for their shares, target managers are in a better position
to help elect a board that would want to retain their services.

Valuation
Information Asymmetry, Payment Choice, and Announcement
Bidder Performance
Corporate finance has put forward various hypotheses regarding the instances in which
management will more likely use stock financing. The theory is that stock financing
will more likely be used, as opposed to other financing alternatives such as borrow-
ing, when the stock is overvalued.49 Because management and directors have better
information about the company’s future profits and returns opportunities, they are in a
better position to evaluate the market’s attempt to value the company’s expected prof-
its and returns. When they find the market’s assessment overoptimistic, they may be
more inclined to issue what they consider to be overvalued shares. As applied to acquisi-
tions, the theory assumes that the market is aware of the significance of management’s
announcement to use stock to finance a deal. Taking this as a negative signal that man-
agement believes the stock to be overvalued, the stock price of the bidder should weaken
when the deal and its financing choice are announced. This theoretical conclusion is
supported by Amihud, Lev, and Travlos, who found that the cases where there were
negative bidder returns occurred when managerial ownership was low. The negative
market response did not occur when managerial ownership was high. They assume the
market is concluding that when managerial ownership is high, the deal is at least not
value-reducing. When management has low ownership, the manager’s interests may
not be well aligned with shareholders and agency conflicts may increase. When compa-
nies with low managerial ownership issue stock to finance a deal, the market has less
assurance that the deal will be in shareholders’ interests and not one that will further
management’s own agenda.
Institutional Ownership, Blockholders, and Stock Financing
Managerial ownership is not the only factor affecting the use of stock in financing
deals. Martin found that institutional holdings were also inversely related to the use of
stock to finance deals. He found that companies that have more of their stock held by
institutions tend to not use stock as much to finance their acquisitions. These institu-
tions seem to act as a monitor on the willingness of management to liberally use stock
to buy targets. Institutions, either directly or indirectly, seem to convey to management
they do not want the company to issue more shares, thereby diluting their holdings,
in order to acquire other companies. The empirical findings of Martin confirm what
has been contended by those such as Jensen, who has opined that higher institutional
ownership and blockholdings give these investors an incentive to engage in more
close monitoring of management and corporate performance, which, given the incen-
tives and rewards, would not be worthwhile for shareholders with relatively smaller
holdings.50

Legal Issues in Stock-Financed Transactions
Buyers seeking to finance an acquisition through the use of securities must be mindful
of the registration requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that
are set forth in the Securities Act of 1933. Sellers prefer registered securities that can be
readily sold in the market. However, buyers may prefer to offer unregistered securities.
One reason buyers may prefer unregistered securities is the cost of the registration pro-
cess, which is expensive in terms of both professional fees and management time. The
registration process may also require the buyer to make public information it may not
want to reveal to other parties, such as competitors. In addition, the registration process
may impose impediments on the buyer that may inhibit its ability to take certain actions
lest they necessitate an amendment in the registration statement filed with the SEC.
It may be possible for the parties to negotiate an agreement that allows the buyer to
take advantage of certain exemptions to the registration requirements. The buyer may
try to qualify for an exemption on the grounds that the securities being offered to pur-
chase the target company do not constitute a public offering. Although the attainment
of this nonpublic offering exemption is often not a certainty, it may have a significant
effect on the costs of the total transaction from the buyer’s viewpoint, as well as on the
value the seller places on the consideration being offered by the buyer.
EXCHANGE RATIO
The exchange ratio is the number of the acquirer’s shares that are offered for each share
of the target. The number of shares offered depends on the valuation of the target by the
acquirer. For example, in April 2006, Alcatel and Lucent announced a stock-for-stock
merger in which each Lucent shareholder would receive 0.1952 of an Alcatel American
depository share for each share of Lucent they owned.
To arrive at the exchange ratio both the acquirer and the target conduct a valuation
of the target, and from this process the acquirer determines the maximum price it is will-
ing to pay while the target determines the minimum it is willing to accept. Within this
range, the actual agreement price will depend on each party’s other investment oppor-
tunities and relative bargaining abilities. Based on a valuation of the target, the acquirer
determines the per-share price it is offering to pay. The exchange ratio is determined
by dividing the per-share offer price by the market price of the acquirer’s shares. Let us
consider the example of United Communications, which has made an offer for Dynamic
Entertainment (Table 15.5).
Let us assume that, based on its valuation of Dynamic, United Communications has
determined that it is willing to offer $65 per share for Dynamic. This is a 30% premium
above the premerger market price of Dynamic. In terms of United’s shares, the $65 offer
is equivalent to United’s $65/$150 share.
Exchange ratio = Offer price∕Share price of acquirer
= $65∕$150 = 0.43 shares

United Communications will experience an increase in its EPS if the deal is

Assume that Dynamic Entertainment rejects the first offer of $65 per share. In
addition, assume that this rejection is based partly on Dynamic’s own internal analysis
showing the value of Dynamic to be at least $75. Dynamic also believes that its value
to United is well in excess of $75. Based on some hard bargaining, United brings a $90
offer to the table.
To see the impact on the surviving company’s EPS, we will have to redo the preced-
ing analysis, using this higher offer price:

= $90∕$150 = 0.60 shares

Criteria for Dilution in EPS
Dilution in EPS will occur any time the P/E ratio paid for the target exceeds the P/E ratio
of the company doing the acquiring. The P/E ratio paid is calculated by dividing the EPS
of the target into the per-share offer price. This is as follows:
P∕E ratio paid = $65∕$5 = $13 < $15
Offer price = $65
In the case of the $65 offer, the P/E ratio paid was less than the P/E ratio of the
acquirer, and there was no dilution in EPS. Figure 15.3 shows the variation in the P/E
paid for public companies. It shows how these premiums rose in the fourth and fifth
merger waves.

Offer price = $90
P∕E ratio paid = $90∕$5 = $18
In the case of the $90 offer, the P/E ratio paid was greater than the P/E ratio of the
acquirer, and there was a dilution in EPS.
Highest Offer Price without Dilution in EPS
We can determine the maximum offer price that will not result in a dilution in EPS by
solving for P′ in the following expression:
Maximum nondilution offer price (P′)
$15 = P∕$5
P = $75
Solving for P
′, we see that the maximum offer price that will not result in a dilution
in EPS is $75. This does not mean that the acquirer will not offer a price in excess of $75
per share. A firm might be willing to incur an initial dilution in EPS to achieve certain
benefits, such as synergies, that will result in an eventual increase in per share earnings.
This can be seen in the trend in EPS in Table 15.6.
An examination of Table 15.6 reveals that although United Communications would
incur an initial $0.32 dilution in EPS, United would quickly surpass its premerger EPS
level. Let us assume that United had a historical 4% growth in EPS before the merger. In
other words, United’s rate of growth in EPS was equal only to the rate of inflation. Pre-
sumably, United was interested in Dynamic Entertainment in order to achieve a higher
rate of growth. Let us also assume that a premerger analysis convinced United that it
would be able to achieve a 5% rate of growth after it acquired Dynamic Entertainment.
Based on a 5% rate of growth, it is clear that United Communications would achieve
a higher EPS level by the fourth year. A more precise estimate of the breakeven point can

0.01412 = (0.004156)
The firm may have a ceiling on the maximum amount of time it may be willing to
wait until it breaks even with respect to EPS. If United Communications is willing to wait
approximately 3.25 years to break even, it may agree to the merger at the higher price
of $90. If United thinks that this is too long to wait, it may agree only at a lower price or
it may look for other merger candidates.
Factors That Inﬂuence Initial Changes in Earnings per Share
The amount of change in EPS is a function of two main factors:
1. Differential in P/E ratios. Rule: The higher the P/E ratio of the acquirer relative to the
target, the greater the increase in EPS of the acquirer.
2. Relative size of the two firms as measured by earnings. Rule: The larger the earnings of
the target relative to the acquirer, the greater the increase in the acquirer’s EPS.
The first factor has already been explained, but the role of the relative size of the
two firms must be explored. For the sake of this discussion, let us assume that earnings
are an acceptable measure of value. Because EPS is the ratio of earnings divided by the
number of outstanding shares, the greater the addition to the earnings of the surviving
firm that is accounted for by the addition of the target’s earnings, the greater the EPS of
the surviving firm. This is a commonsense proposition.
We can combine the effect of both factors to say that the higher the P/E ratio of the
acquirer relative to the target and the greater the earnings of the target relative to the
acquirer, the greater the increase in the combined company’s EPS. The opposite also
follows. The combined effect of the P/E ratio differential and the relative earnings of the
two firms can be seen in Figure 15.4.
Bootstrapping Earnings per Share
Bootstrapping EPS refers to the corporation’s ability to increase its EPS through the pur-
chase of other companies. These earnings were prevalent during the third merger wave

of the late 1960s. During this time, the market was not efficient in its valuation of con-
glomerates. These conglomerates were able to experience an increase in EPS and stock
prices simply by acquiring other firms.
In the case of United Communications’ acquisition of Dynamic Entertainment,
United issued 866,666.67 shares of stock based on a $65 offer price. This results in
5,866,667.67 total shares of United Communications outstanding (Table 15.7).
With the offer price of $65 per share, United Communications can offer Dynamic
Entertainment a 30% premium above its premerger price of $50 and still experience
an increase in EPS. If we assume that the market will apply the same EPS to United
before and after the merger, the stock price has to rise. This can be seen in the following
expression:
P∕E = P∕EPS
15 = P∕$10.23
P = $153.45
(15.23)

Exchange Ratio
◾
601
United Communications’ postmerger stock price has risen to $153.45 as a result of
bootstrapping EPS. Two conditions are necessary for bootstrapping EPS to occur:
1. The P/E ratio must not decline following the merger. This implies that the market must
be willing to apply at least the premerger P/E ratio after the merger. If the market
decides that the combined firm is not as valuable, per dollar of earnings, there may
be a market correction and the P/E ratio may fall. In the third merger wave, the
market was slow to reevaluate the growing conglomerates and apply a lower P/E
ratio.
2. TheacquirermusthaveahigherP/Eratiothanthetarget.Ifthesetwoconditionsprevail,
companies with higher P/E ratios can acquire companies with lower P/E ratios and
experience growth in EPS. This gives the acquiring company an incentive to con-
tinue with further acquisitions and have even greater increase in EPS. The process
will continue to work as long as the stock market continues to value the acquiring
company with the same P/E ratio. This occurred during the late 1960s. The move-
ment came to an end when the market corrected itself as it questioned many of the
acquisitions that appeared to lack synergistic benefits.
Postmerger P/E Ratio
If the market is efficient, bootstrapping EPS is not possible. The postmerger P/E ratio
will be a weighted average of the premerger P/E ratios. This can be calculated using the
following expression:
P
EA+B
= (PA × SA) + (PB × SB)
EA + EB
(15.24)
Using the preceding expression, we can calculate United Communications’ post-
merger P/E ratio after the stock-for-stock acquisition of Dynamic Entertainment. We
will calculate this ratio based on the $65 initial offer that required the issuance of
866,666.67 shares:
P
EU+D
= (PU + SU) + (PD + SU)

= $750, 000,000 −$100, 000,000
$60, 000,000
= $850,000
$60,000 = 14.17
(15.25)
Without the bootstrapping effect, the P/E ratio of the combined firm falls relative
to United Communications’ premerger P/E ratio. The resulting P/E ratio is a blended
combination of United’s P/E ratio (15) and Dynamic’s lower P/E ratio (10).

AMERISOURCE AND BERGEN BRUNSWIG:
STOCK-FOR-STOCK MERGER
I
n March 2001, two of the largest U.S. drug distributors announced a merger that
would result in a combined capitalization of approximately $5 billion. AmeriSource
Health Corporation had $11.6 billion in revenues in 2000, while Bergen Brunswig
generated almost $23 billion over the same time. Despite the big difference in
size, as measured by revenues, AmeriSource was considered to be the acquirer.
In 2000, AmeriSource generated net income of $99 million and Bergen lost $752
million. Bergen Brunswig’s ﬁnancial difﬁculties can be traced to problems with prior
acquisitions.
Under the initially announced terms of the deal, AmeriSource shareholders
would own 51% of the shares in the combined company. Each share of Bergen would
be valued at 0.37 shares of the combined entity, while each share of common stock
of AmeriSource would equal one share in the new ﬁrm. Before the deal, Bergen had
136.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Using the predeal closing stock price
of AmeriSource of $44.48 and an exchange ratio of 0.37 shares in the combined
company for each share of Bergen, the target is valued as follows:
Number of Bergen shares × Exchange ratio × Value of AmeriSource shares
$136.1 million shares × 0.37 × $44.48 = $2.44 billion = Value of Bergen
Number of AmeriSource shares × Predeal value of AmeriSource shares
$52.4 million shares × $44.48 = $2.33 billion
Approximate combined equity value = $5 billion
AmeriSource shareholder’s percentage: 51%; Bergen shareholder’s percentage:

FIXED NUMBER OF SHARES VERSUS FIXED VALUE
A buyer in a stock-for-stock transaction can offer either a fixed number of shares in its
company or a specific dollar value. When the number of shares is fixed, its value can
vary as the stock price of the acquirer varies. The value the seller receives and the buyer
provides then varies depending on movements in the bidder’s stock price. A buyer, how-
ever, can simply offer a fixed value, and the actual number of shares may vary as the
stock price of the acquirer varies. The uncertainty caused by a fixed number of shares
can be reduced through a collar agreement. Such an agreement usually stipulates that if
the stock price goes above or below a certain value, there will be an adjustment in the
exchange ratio.

International Takeovers and Stock-for-Stock Transactions
◾
603
The collar agreement may tolerate small movements in the stock price without
causing changes in the exchange ratio. A certain threshold is established beyond which
the exchange ratio has to be adjusted. The existence of a collar agreement in a merger
is usually a point of negotiation. It is more important if the stock of one or both of
the participants tends to be volatile. If both firms are in the same industry, market
movements in each stock might offset each other. However, many collar agreements
allow the bidder to walk away from a deal if its stock price moves higher than the range
for its stock set forth in the collar. This adds an element of uncertainty that is important
for the parties to the transactions but also for risk arbitragers.
MERGER NEGOTIATIONS AND STOCK OFFERS: HALLIBURTON
VERSUS BAKER HUGHES
When a bidder makes a takeover offer, whether it be stock, cash, or both, targets will
often try to negotiate for a better offer. In stock offers this translates to getting more
shares of the bidder, which really means more shares in a combined company. Some-
times these negotiations can go on for an extended period of time. During such a time
period market conditions and the financial performance of the respective companies can
change. A good example of this occurred toward the end of 2014 when Halliburton
Co. offered $19 plus 1.05 of its shares for each share of Baker Hughes. This resulted
in a value just under $35 billion. Baker Hughes wanted a better price and better terms
such as a significant breakup fee. Negotiations between the two companies continued
through the period when the third quarter financial results were reported. Unfortu-
nately for Baker Hughes, its third quarter results were disappointing while Halliburton’s
exceeded street forecasts. This increased Halliburton’s leverage and, while it did increase
its offer, they did not have to go as far as Baker Hughes wanted and were able to reach an
agreement with Baker Hughes, subject to approval from antitrust authorities, to acquire
the company for roughly $35 billion using the same amount of cash but 1.12 Hallibur-
ton shares for each share of Baker Hughes.
INTERNATIONAL TAKEOVERS AND STOCK-FOR-STOCK
TRANSACTIONS
One complication that can occur with international takeovers is that target company
shareholders may not want to hold shares in the acquiring corporation. This often is
the case for U.S. shareholders who receive shares in European corporations. Displaying
a preference for U.S. stock, target company shareholders may sell their shares in the
acquiring company. When these shares return to the acquiring company’s market, they
can cause its stock price to decline. Such a decline could effectively increase the costs
of the acquisition for the bidder. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as domestic
market flowback.

◾
Valuation
DESIRABLE FINANCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TARGETS
Acquirers can use the following characteristics as financial screens:
◾
Rapidly growing cash flows and earnings. A pattern of rising cash flows and earnings
is the most desirable characteristic. The future cash flows are the most direct benefit
the buyer derives from an acquisition. Therefore, a rising historical trend in these
values may be an indicator of higher levels in the future.
◾
Low price relative to earnings. A P/E that is low compared with its level over the past
two to three years suggests that the company may be relatively inexpensive. A low
P/E ratio is generally considered a desirable characteristic in a target. The lower the
P/E ratio, the lower the price that will be paid to acquire the target’s earning power.
Because of market fluctuations, the P/E ratio of a firm or an industry category may
go up and down. In addition, the market fluctuates up and down. A falling stock
price that is not caused by a reduction in the potential target’s earning power may
present a temporary undervaluation and an acquisition opportunity. An acquirer
can measure the extent of the undervaluation by comparing the P/E ratio with the
previous level over the preceding three years. A low level can mean undervaluation
due to changes in investor preferences, or it can reflect a change in the firm’s ability
to generate income in the future. The lowest value in three years is an indicator of
one of the two; it is the analyst’s job to decide which one it is. (Although the prior
discussion is framed in terms of a P/E ratio, it also applies to a pre–cash flow ratio.)
◾
Market value less than book value. Book value is a more reliable measure of value in
certain industries. Industries that tend to have more liquid assets also tend to have
more useful book values. Finance companies and banks are examples of firms that
have a large percentage of liquid assets. Even in industries in which assets may be
less liquid, such as in firms that have large real estate holdings, however, book value
can be put to use as a floor value. This was the case in Campeau Corporation’s acqui-
sition of Federated Stores in 1988. Both firms had large real estate holdings and
marketable divisions and store chains. The combined market value of these assets
and the estimated market value of the divisions on a per-share basis made Federated
a vulnerable target. In retrospect, the estimated value of the divisions proved to be
greater than their market value when they were offered for sale. When the market
is high, it is harder to find targets that fit this criterion.
◾
High liquidity. A target company’s own liquidity can be used to help finance its own
acquisitions. High liquidity ratios relative to industry averages are a reflection of
this condition. The additional liquidity is even more applicable for debt-financed
takeovers, where the liquidity of the target may beanimportant factorinthetarget’s
ability to pay for its own financing after the merger.
◾
Low leverage. Low leverage ratios, such as the debt ratio and debt–equity ratio, are
desirable because this shows a lower level of risk as well as added debt capacity that
can be used to finance the takeover. The more cyclical the industry, the more impor-
tant it is to keep leverage within a manageable range.

Desirable Financial Characteristics of Targets

Valuation of Private Businesses
Closely held businesses vary tremendously in size. Many think of closely held businesses
as small businesses. This is not true. For example, the largest closely held company in
the United States is Koch Industries. In November 2005, Koch acquired the publicly
held Georgia Pacific for $13.2 billion. The deal gave the company total annual revenues
of $80 billion, which enabled it to overtake Cargill as the largest closely held company in
the United States. Large closely held companies are much more common in Europe. One
example is Bertelsmann, the giant German media conglomerate controlled by the Mohn
family since the 1800s. It has revenues in excess of $20 billion from a variety of sources,
including broadcast and TV services, book and magazine publishing, and recorded
music. Instead of traditional stock, the company has issued “profit participation
certificates,” which trade on the Frankfurt exchange. They allow investors to gain from
Bertelsmann’s profitability, while allowing the Mohn family and foundations it controls
to retain controls of the media conglomerate. To raise capital the company completed
Germany’s largest IPO through a sale of 25.5 million shares in its RTL Group unit.
The valuation models that we have already discussed can be readily applied to
value closely held businesses. However, certain adjustments may have to be made.
These adjustments are warranted based on the differences between public and private
companies.
A major difference between public and private business valuations centers on the
availability and reliability of financial data.51 Some of these differences are caused by the
efforts of firms, particularly private businesses, to minimize taxable income. Another
factor is the requirement that public firms disclose certain financial data in a specific
manner, whereas private firms do not face such requirements.
Reported Taxable Income
Although current tax regulations mandate the same requirements with regard to the
declaration of taxable income for both publicly and privately held companies, owners
of closely held businesses take every opportunity to keep taxable income low and there-
forehavea lowertax obligation. Althoughpublicfirmsalso want to minimizetheirtaxes,
privatelyheldbusinesseshavegreatermeansavailabletodosothantheirpubliccounter-
parts. Because of these efforts to minimize taxable income, private companies may issue
financial data that is not a clear representation of their earning ability. This is usually
not the case in public firms. Therefore, analysts may not be able to rely on the reported
income of privately held firms to reflect their true profitability and earning power.
With regard to declaring income, public and private corporations have dramatically
different objectives. Public corporations have several outside constraints that provide
strong incentives to declare a higher taxable income. One of these constraints is the pres-
sure applied by stockholders, the true “owners” of the corporation, to have a regular flow
of dividends. Because dividends are paid out of taxable income, the public corporation’s
ability to minimize taxable income is limited.

gation,” Journal of Forensic Economics 4, no. 1 (Winter 1990): 55–64.

Public Corporations and the Reporting of Income
Like their private counterparts, public corporations want to minimize taxes, but given
their dividend obligations toward stockholders, public corporations have fewer opportu-
nities to do so. They do not have as much ability to manipulate their reported income,
primarilybecauseoftheaccountingreviewrequirementsthattheshareholderreporting
process imposes on them.
In preparing financial statements, there are three levels of accounting reports:
compilation, review, and audited statements. The compilation is the least rigorous of
the three, whereas audited financial statements will result in a scrutiny of the financial
data by an independent examination of the company’s financial records. Public corpo-
rations are required to prepare audited financial statements for their annual reports.
These audit requirements are enforced by the SEC, subject to the requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC does not accept a review or a compilation
statement for a 10K report. A review is acceptable for a 10Q quarterly report (although
for a public company this involves a more detailed review than for a closely held firm).
However, a compilation is not acceptable for use in preparing either of these types
of published financial reports. Because the reported income contained in published
financial statements is subject to audit, the profit numbers tend to be more reliable than
those that appear in the financial statements of private firms, which may or may not be
audited. The lack of required audit scrutiny is one reason the reported profit levels may
lack validity. The lack of an audit requirement allows private firms to manipulate their
reported income levels to minimize taxable income. It is in this area that public and
private corporations tend to have two very different agendas. Public firms may want
to demonstrate higher reported profits to impress stockholders. Stockholders may
become more impressed when these reported profits are translated into higher dividend
payments or increased stock prices.
Private corporations are subject to neither the government’s public disclosure
requirements nor the constraints and pressures of public securities markets. Free to
utilize every opportunity to show a smaller taxable income, they therefore have a
lower tax bill. A private corporation can reduce taxable income in two ways. The first
is to have lower reported revenues, and the second is to show higher costs. The first
approach is more common for small businesses, particularly cash businesses, which
sometimes show a smaller than actual level of reported income. This is occasionally
done through deliberately inaccurate record keeping. In addition to being illegal, this
practice creates obvious problems for the evaluators.
If there is a reason to believe that a company’s revenues have been underreported,
an estimate of the actual revenues may be reconstructed. This sometimes occurs in liti-
gation involving minority stockholders who are suing for their share in a business. The
actual revenue levels can be reconstructed from activity and volume measures, such as
materials and inputs purchased, which can be translated into sales of final outputs.
The most common form of income manipulation for purposes of minimizing taxes
is giving higher than normal compensation, benefits, and perquisites to officers. The
entrepreneurs of closely held companies may withdraw a disproportionate amount

of income from the company relative to total revenues. Furthermore, entrepreneurial
owners may list a variety of extraordinary personal benefits on the corporation’s books
as expenses. Although these expenses may be legitimate tax deductions, they really are
another form of compensation to the owner. Any measure of the closely held corpo-
ration’s profitability that does not take into account these less overt forms of return to
the owners will fall short of measuring the business’s actual profitability. Evaluators
of closely held businesses often have to recast the income statement to reflect the true
earning power of the business. This may involve adding back, after an adjustment for
tax effects, costs that are really a form of compensation for the owners.
Factors to Consider When Valuing Closely Held Businesses
One set of factors that is often cited in valuing private firms is Revenue Ruling 59–60.
This ruling sets forth various factors that tax courts consider in a valuation of the stock
of closely held businesses for gift and estate purposes. These factors are as follows:
◾
Nature and history of the business
◾
Condition of the economy and the industry
◾
Book value of the company and its financial condition
◾
Earnings capacity of the company
◾
Dividend-paying capacity
◾
Existence of goodwill or other intangibles
◾
Other sales of stock
◾
Prices of comparable stock
Evaluators of closely held businesses should be aware of the factors that are set forth
inRevenueRuling59–60becausetheseareoften-citedstandardsforthevaluationofthe
stock of closely held companies. The inclusion of certain factors such as both earnings
and dividend-paying capacity may be questionable because dividend-paying capacity
presumably is a function of earnings capacity. In addition, closely held companies
tend not to distribute earnings as dividends because dividends are not tax-deductible.
Industry analysis and a macroeconomic and possibly regional economic analysis are
important enough to be treated as separate components of the valuation process.
Putting a lot of weight on book value, a measure that may not accurately reflect the
value of the company, is questionable. Revenue Ruling 59–60 also fails to mention other
benchmarks, such as liquidation value, which may be worth considering along with
book value. Taking these issues into consideration, this revenue ruling is important to
be aware of but should not be the exclusive list of factors that are considered.

the median P/E multiple for closely held companies was only 17.1. It is also noteworthy
that as the economy slowed in 2008–2009, the median public P/E offered fell from 24.9
in 2007 to 18.1 in 2009, which is similar to the P/E offered for private companies. How-
ever, the P/E offered quickly rebounded and in 2015 it reached near-term record levels
before reverting to mean levels the next year.
Adjustments to Valuation Methods
We have noted that the same methods used to value public businesses can be applied
to the valuation of closely held companies. In some ways it is easier to value a public
company because there is a market that regularly values the equity of these companies.
However, for private businesses there are various transactions databases that provide
data on purchase prices of acquisitions and multiples that the companies sold for.

Desirable Financial Characteristics of Targets
◾
609
They are organized by industry and size so that evaluators can get a list of comparable
transactions and derive average multiples that can be applied to place a value on closely
held businesses.
Since there is a much greater abundance of data on public companies than there is
on closely held businesses, we may want to use multiples from market trading of public
firms to value closely held businesses. That is, we may want to take an average indus-
try P/E ratio and use it to value a closely held company. Before we do so we need to
make certain adjustments before this value can be used. Various research studies have
attempted to measure the marketability discount that should be applied to public stock
prices and multiples to make them relevant to closely held companies. Many of them
analyzed the difference between the prices that restricted (nontradable to the public on
the market) shares trade for private sales and the market prices of those shares. Much of
that research was initially done in the 1970s.52 Later studies compared the prices that
shares of closely held companies sold for prior to companies going public with IPO prices
after the company went public. Those studies were first done in the 1980s.53 These vari-
ous studies put forward a wide range of marketability discounts that supports a discount
in the one-third range.
Minority Discounts
A second discount might also be needed, depending on the percentage of ownership the
privately held stock position constitutes. This is because control is an additional valu-
able characteristic that a majority position possesses that is not present in a minority
holding. A minority shareholder is often at the mercy of majority shareholders. The
holder of a minority position can elect only a minority of the directors, and possibly
none of the directors, depending on whether the corporation is incorporated in a state
that allows cumulative voting. Majority shareholders and minority shareholders each
possess proportionate rights to dividends distribution, but a majority shareholder pos-
sesses the right to control the actions of the corporations in addition to these dividend
claims. This is an additional valuable characteristic, and an additional premium must
be paid for it.
If the valuation of the closely held company was done using transaction data that
featured the acquisition of control of the various companies considered, then these data
need to be adjusted to eliminate the added value that entered into these data to eliminate
the part of the multiple that accounted for control.54

Valuation
A guide to the appropriate minority discount is the magnitude of the average control
premium. Table 15.9 shows that the average control premium between 1980 and 2016
was 43.4%. This premium can be used to compute the appropriate minority discount
using the formula in equation 15.26.
Minority discount = 1 −[1∕(1 + Average premium)]
(15.26)
Using the average control premium of 42.8%, we get an implied minority discount
of 30%.
Applying Marketability and Minority Discounts
Let us assume that a value of $50 per share has been computed for a 20% ownership
position in a closely held firm. Assuming 33% marketability and minority discounts, the
value of this stock position equals the following:
Unadjusted value = $50/share
Less 33% marketability discount = $33.50
Less 33% minority discount = $22.45
The $22.45-per-share value is the value of a nonmarketable minority position in
this closely held business.
Valuation Research on Takeovers of Privately Held Companies
Although there is an abundance of published research on the valuation effects of
takeovers of public companies, there is limited research for closely held businesses. This
is because data are readily available on public companies, but they are much harder
to come by for private firms. One study by Chang analyzed the stock price reaction
of public bidding firms when they acquire private companies.55 In a study of 281
merger proposals between 1981 and 1992, which did not include any tender offers,
Chang found that bidding firms did not experience any abnormal returns for cash
offers but did show positive abnormal returns for stock offers. The positive returns for
stock offers contrast with some research on stock acquisitions of public companies
that feature negative returns. Chang compared the stock offers with private equity
placements because the closely held targets typically were owned by a small number of
shareholders. These positive returns are consistent with the research on the returns to
companies that issue stock in private placements.56
One possible explanation for the positive stock response for public acquirers is that
there may be more monitoring when stock is given to a few owners of the closely held
company. This greater monitoring may reduce adverse agency effects and increase
value. When the market perceives this, it reacts with a positive stock price response.

Valuation Research on Takeovers by Privately Held Companies
Our discussions of corporate governance raised concerns that CEOs and boards were at
times not sufficiently caring for the wealth of their shareholders. One test of this con-
ducted by Bargeron, Schlingemann, Stulz, and Zutter analyzed a sample of 1,667 deals,
of which 453 were acquisitions by private bidders.57 They found that public sharehold-
ers received a 63% higher premium when the acquirer was a public company as opposed
to a closely held firm. The difference between the private and public acquirer premiums
was greatest when the share ownership by management in the public company was
low. This confirms the intuitive proposition that people are more careful when they are
spending their own money as opposed to someone else’s, such as largely anonymous
shareholders.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Tax Issues in M&A
D
EPENDING ON THE METHOD used to finance the transaction, certain mergers,
acquisitions, and restructuring may be tax-free. Some firms may use their tax
benefits as assets in establishing the correct price that they might command in
the marketplace. For this reason, tax considerations are important as both the motiva-
tion for a transaction and the valuation of a company. Part of the tax benefits from a
transaction may derive from tax synergy, whereby one of the firms involved in a merger
may not be able to fully utilize its tax shields. When combined with the merger part-
ner, however, the tax shields may offset income. Some of these gains may come from
unused net operating losses, which may be used by a more profitable merger partner.
Tax reform, however, has limited the ability of firms to sell these net operating losses
through mergers.
Othersourcesoftaxbenefitsinmergersmayarisefromamarketvalueofdepreciable
assets, which is greater than the value at which these assets are kept on the target’s
books. The acquiring firm that is able to step up the basis of these assets in accordance
with the purchase price may finally realize tax savings.
This chapter discusses the mechanics of realizing some of the tax benefits through
mergers. It also reviews the research studies that attempt to determine the importance
of tax effects as a motivating factor for mergers and leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and
examines the different accounting treatments that may be applied to a merger or an
acquisition. These methods, which are regulated by tax laws, affect the importance of
taxes in the overall merger valuation. It will be seen that various reforms in tax laws
have diminished the role that taxes play in mergers and acquisitions. However, taxes
may still be an important consideration that both the seller and buyer must carefully
weigh before completing a transaction. The importance of tax considerations in M&As
is underscored by the significant role tax attorneys play in deal making. That is, not

just attorneys versed in securities and corporate law but also tax specialists are key
members of the M&A team.
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING FOR M&As
Until 2001, there were two alternative accounting treatments for mergers and acquisi-
tions: pooling and the purchase method. The main difference between them is the value
that the combined firm’s balance sheet places on the assets of the acquired firm, as well
as the depreciation allowances and charges against income following the merger. After
much debate, however, the accounting profession eliminated pooling. All mergers must
now be accounted for under the purchase method. In eliminating pooling, the United
States came more into conformance with the accounting standards of most of the indus-
trialized world.
Under the purchase method, the transaction is recorded at its fair market value. Fair
market value is defined as the total amount paid for the acquisition, including related
costs of the acquisition, such as legal and accounting fees, broker’s commission, and the
like. If the acquisition is consummated with stock, then the acquisition price is based on
the fair market value of the stock.
Assets that are acquired are assigned part of the overall cost of the acquisition based
ontheirfairmarketvalueasoftheacquisition.Anyexcessvaluethatcannotbeallocated
to specific assets is then assigned to goodwill. This goodwill value needs to be regularly
revisited, and if the company determines that the value assigned to it is not accurate,
then it needs to be adjusted. Goodwill can be amortized over 15 years (under certain
circumstances this can be 10 years for certain closely held businesses).
Under the purchase method, the acquiring company is entitled to income of the
acquired company only from the date of purchase. Prior retained earnings of
the acquired company are not allowed to be brought forward to the consolidated entity.
TAXABLE VERSUS TAX-FREE TRANSACTIONS
A merger or an acquisition may be either a taxable transaction or a tax-free transac-
tion. The tax status of a transaction may affect the value of the transaction from the
viewpoint of both the buyer and the seller. A tax-free transaction is known as a tax-free
reorganization. The term tax-free is a misnomer because the tax is not eliminated but will
be realized when a later taxable transaction occurs. So they are really only tax-deferred,
not tax-free.
Rules of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service require that target shareholders immedi-
ately pay capital gains taxes on an all-cash purchase of their shares. Sometimes a bidder
may pay target shareholders an additional sum to offset the taxes they may have to pay.
The extent to which this may occur depends on the relative bargaining power of the
parties.
Deals involving stock may qualify for tax benefits. We will now discuss the circum-
stances in which this could occur.

Taxable versus Tax-Free Transactions
◾
615
Tax-Free Reorganizations
There are several different types of tax-free reorganizations. Each is discussed here.
Type A Reorganization
For a transaction to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, it must be structured in
certain ways.1 One way is a type A reorganization, which is considered a more flexible
tax-free reorganization technique than some of the others that are discussed in the
following sections. In contrast to a type B reorganization, a type A reorganization allows
the buyer to use either voting stock or nonvoting stock, common stock or preferred
stock, or even other securities. It also permits the buyer to use more cash in the total
consideration because the law does not stipulate a maximum amount of cash that may
be used. At least 50% of the consideration, however, must be stock in the acquiring
corporation. In addition, in a type A reorganization, the acquiring corporation may
choose not to purchase all the target’s assets. For example, the deal could be structured
to allow the target to sell off certain assets separately and exclude them from this
transaction.
In cases in which at least 50% of the bidder’s stock is used as the consideration, but
other considerations are used, such as cash, debt, or nonequity securities, the transac-
tion may be partially taxable. Capital gains taxes must be paid on those shares that were
exchanged for nonequity consideration, whereas taxes are deferred for those shares that
were exchanged for stock. Rights and warrants that are convertible into the bidding
firm’s equity securities are generally classified as taxable.2
A type A reorganization must fulfill the continuity of interests requirement. That is,
the shareholders in the acquired company must receive enough stock in the acquiring
firm that they have a continuing financial interest in the buyer.3
Type B Reorganization
A type B merger or reorganization requires that the acquiring corporation use mainly its
own voting common stock as the consideration for purchase of the target corporation’s
common stock. Cash must constitute no more than 20% of the total consideration, and
at least 80% of the target’s stock must be paid for by voting stock in the acquirer. In this
type of transaction, the acquiring corporation must buy at least 80% of the stock of the
target, although the purchase of 100% is more common. Target company shareholders
may not be given the option to opt for cash as opposed to stock, where the effect could

be that less than 80% of stock could be used. The presentation of this option, even if at
least 80% of stock is actually used, disallows the type B reorganization.
Following the purchase of the target’s stock, the target becomes a subsidiary of the
acquiring corporation. In both type A and type B reorganizations, the transactions are
viewed, from a tax regulatory point of view, as merely a continuation of the original cor-
porateentitiesinareorganizedform.Therefore,thesetransactionsarenottaxedbecause
they are not considered true sales.
It is possible to have a creeping type B reorganization, in which the stock is purchased
in several transactions over a period of time. To qualify as a type B reorganization, how-
ever, the stock purchases must be part of an overall plan to acquire the target company.
The plan itself must be implemented over 12 months or less. In a creeping type B reor-
ganization, only stock may be used as consideration. It is acceptable for the acquiring
company to have bought some stock in the target with cash in the past as long as the
purchases were not part of the acquisition plan.
Type C Reorganization
In a type C reorganization, the acquiring corporation must purchase 80% of the fair
marketvalueofthetarget’sassets.Cashmaybeusedonlyifatleast80%ofthefairmarket
value of the target’s assets has been purchased using the voting stock of the acquiring
corporation. As a result of the transaction, the target company usually must liquidate.
One advantage of a type C reorganization is that the acquiring company may not
need to receive approval of its shareholders in such an asset purchase. Of course, target
shareholders must approve this type of control transaction.
Type D Reorganization
There are two kinds of type D reorganizations. One type covers acquisitions, and the
other covers restructuring. In an acquisitive type D reorganization, the acquiring com-
pany receives 80% of the stock in the target in exchange for voting stock in the acquiring
company. Shareholders in the acquiring company become controlling shareholders in
the target.
Divisive type D reorganizations cover spinoffs, split-ups, and split-offs. As discussed
in Chapter 11, one or more corporations are formed in a spinoff, with the stock in
the new companies being distributed to the original company shareholders according
to some predetermined formula. In a split-off, a component of the original company
is separated from the parent company, and shareholders in the original company
may exchange their shares for shares in the new entity. In a split-up, the original
company ceases to exist, and one or more new companies are formed from the original
business.
There are some additional requirements that a divisive type D reorganization must
fulfill to qualify as tax-free. For example, the distribution of shares must not be for the
purpose of tax avoidance. Both the parent company and the spun-off entity must be in
business for at least five years before the spinoff.

Tax Consequences of a Stock-for-Stock Exchange
◾
617
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF A STOCK-FOR-STOCK EXCHANGE
Target stockholders who receive the stock of the acquiring corporation in exchange for
their common stock are not immediately taxed on the consideration they receive. Taxes
must be paid only if the stock is eventually sold. Given the time value of money, this post-
ponement of tax payments clearly has value. If cash is included in the transaction, this
cash may be taxed to the extent that it represents a gain on the sale of stock.
Taxable Purchases of Stock
As noted, consideration other than stock, such as cash or debt securities, may result in a
tax liability for the target shareholders. This tax liability applies only to a gain that might
be realized from sale of the stock. If the stock is sold at a loss, no tax liability results.
Taxable Purchases of Assets
A tax liability may also result when the acquiring corporation purchases the assets of the
target using consideration other than stock in the acquiring corporation. The potential
tax liability is measured by comparing the purchase price of the assets with the adjusted
basis of these assets.
Taxable versus Partially Taxable Transactions
A transaction may be partially taxable if the consideration is a combination of stock and
cash. The stock consideration may not be taxed, but the cash is taxed. Therefore, the
percentage of the transaction that is taxable depends on the relative percentages of stock
and cash.
Tax Loss Carryforwards
A tax loss or tax credit carryover was a more important motive for mergers and
acquisitions in prior years, such as the early 1980s, than it is today. In fact, at one time
companies advertised the availability of such tax gains to motivate a sale. The Tax Code,
however, has been changed to try to prevent such tax-motivated transactions.
The tax losses of target corporations can be used to offset a limited amount of the
acquiring corporation’s future income for a maximum of 15 years or until the tax loss
is exhausted. Before 1981, the maximum period was five years. Only tax losses for the
previous three years can be used to offset future income.
Tax loss carryforwards may motivate mergers and acquisitions in two ways. A com-
pany that has earned profits may find value in the tax losses of a target corporation that
can be used to offset the income it plans to earn. Targets may demand that bidder com-
pensate them for these benefits.4 There is empirical evidence of this in studies that show
that takeover premiums are higher in all cash bids compared to stock offers.

◾
Tax Issues in M&A
Although tax benefits may be an important factor in determining whether a merger
will take place, they may not be the sole motivating one. A merger may not be structured
solely for tax purposes. The goal of the merger must be to maximize the profitability of
the acquiring corporation.
An example of the gains that an acquirer may reap from merging with a target
that has incurred past operating losses is the 2006 Alcatel SA–Lucent Technologies Inc.
merger. When the telecom bubble burst in 2000, Lucent accumulated many billions of
dollars of losses; while the company returned to profitability in 2003, it still did not use
up all of its net operating loss tax credits. The size of these credits was reported to be as
high as $3.5 billion.5 The tax credits can be applied to U.S. profits by the merged com-
pany for many years. Alcatel also had net operating loss credits, and the merger with
Lucent, a company that derives most of its business in the U.S. market, better enabled
Alcatel to use its own credits. While this merger may have enabled Alcatel to receive tax
benefits, it did not, however, result in a stronger company, as the combined entity still
found the competitive landscape quite challenging.
Tax Loss Carryforward Research
A number of research studies have sought to estimate the present value of tax loss car-
ryforwards. These tax benefits may be less than their face value, not only because of the
time value of money but also because they might expire without being fully utilized. Esti-
mates of these values have been developed by Auerbach and Poterba and by Altshuler
and Auerbach.6 These research studies indicate that the two offsetting factors of deferral
and expiration reduce the tax benefits to half their face value.
ASSET BASIS STEP-UP
Tax advantages may arise in an acquisition when a target corporation carries assets on
its books with a basis for tax purposes that is a fraction of the assets’ replacement cost or
market value. These assets could be more valuable for tax purposes if they were owned
by another corporation, which could increase their tax basis after the acquisition and
gain additional depreciation benefits. The tax basis for the acquiring corporation is the
cost or purchase price of the assets. The acquiring corporation may use this higher asset
basis to shelter income.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced some tax benefits. Following its passage,
the selling corporation incurs a greater tax liability on asset sales, which reduces the
seller’s incentive to participate in the transaction. Moreover, research seeking to find

the existence of asset basis step-up as a motivating factor for mergers and acquisitions
before the Tax Reform Act of 1986 did not find asset basis step-up to be a significant
motivating factor.7
CHANGES IN THE TAX LAWS
General Utilities Doctrine
Until its repeal with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the General Utilities Doctrine allowed
preferential treatment for “disincorporating” or liquidating corporations.8 According to
this doctrine, the sale of corporate assets and a liquidating distribution to shareholders
were exempt from capital gains taxation. These distributions could occur, for example,
following the acquisition of one corporation by another. The acquiring corporation
could then sell off the assets of the acquired corporation and distribute the proceeds
to shareholders without incurring capital gains tax liability to the corporation. These
tax-free liquidating distributions could also occur without an acquisition, such as when
a firm chose to sell off certain assets and distribute the proceeds to shareholders.
Assets sales were often structured by establishing separate subsidiary corporations.
An acquired corporation could be purchased and its assets distributed into one or more
subsidiaries. These subsidiaries would contain the assets that the acquiring corporation
was not interested in keeping.9 The assets that would be retained would be put into the
parent corporation or into a separate subsidiary. The stock of the subsidiaries contain-
ing the unwanted assets could then be sold without incurring a significant tax liability.
With the repeal of the General Utilities Doctrine, the gains or losses from an acquisition
must be attributed to the acquiring corporation. The opportunities to avoid such tax
liabilities were narrowed with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. They were
further narrowed by the 1987 and 1988 tax acts.
Elimination of the Morris Trust
The Morris Trust is named after a 1966 tax court decision, Commissioner v. Morris Trust.
This decision established certain variants of spinoffs as tax-free. Using a Morris Trust, a
company could spin off component businesses that it did not want to keep. In a second
set preplanned transaction, the spun-off business is merged into an acquirer’s business
in a tax-free stock transaction. The final result is that shareholders in the selling com-
pany end up with shares in both their own company and the company of the acquirer.
Companies have creatively used these vehicles to borrow money through a subsidiary,
spin it off, and later sell it while having the buyer agree to pay the loan. The selling parent

company keeps the cash from the loan. The tax law was changed in 1997 to eliminate
the tax-free status of a preplanned spinoff and subsequent sale, although if the deal is
not preplanned, it still may be tax-free.
Real Estate Investment Trusts
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are publicly traded, passive investment vehicles
that pay low or no federal taxes. The rebound of the real estate market in the mid-1990s
enhanced the popularity of REITs. Their popularity rose to even greater heights in the
speculative real estate bubble of the mid-2000s.
REITs consist of two entities in one: a management firm that manages real estate
assets and an investment vehicle. Although they are supposed to be separate, their
shares are paired and trade as one. Real estate investment trusts typically purchase
property and rent it to a management firm. The management firm pays out its cash
flow from properties to the investment vehicle, where it is treated as tax-free rent. Real
estate investment trusts must distribute 95% of their earnings to shareholders, who
then pay taxes on these monies at the individual level. Real estate assets such as hotels
and shopping malls are often included in such investment vehicles. By combining them
under the REIT umbrella, a real estate portfolio acquires tax benefits and liquidity. One
of the more famous REITs is Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc. There has
been much debate about reducing the tax benefits of REITs, but such discussions have
not resulted in changes in the laws that relate to REITs.
Given that REITs are required to pay out 90% of their earnings, they are not consid-
ered good for companies that have good growth prospects. An example of the market’s
position on this came in April 1998, when Corrections Corporation of America, the
nation’s largest commercial operator of prisons, announced that it would merge into
CCA Prison Realty Trust, which is a REIT that would be the surviving entity. In response
to the announcement, the stock prices of both companies fell. Shareholders in Correc-
tions Corporation of America were more interested in growth and believed that being in
a REIT would limit growth prospects.
ROLE OF TAXES IN THE MERGER DECISION
If a deal is taxable to the selling shareholders, the benefits are reduced and the deal is less
attractive compared to a tax-deferred transaction. This is why the tax experts working
on the deal try to reduce the adverse tax ramifications of the deal. This is why research
has showed that when the probability of a stock offer increases, measures such as the
bidder’s market-to-book ratio increase.10
There is an intuitive relationship between the premium a bidder offers and the tax
ramifications of the acquisition. As we discussed earlier, if the deal will be taxable, the
bidder may have to offer a higher premium. This was confirmed by research that shows

that target announcement period returns were higher for taxable than nontaxable
(remember, really tax-deferred).11 International M&A research shows similar findings.
For example, Eckbo and Langhor found higher premiums for cash offers in France.12
Auerbach and Reishus examined a sample of 318 mergers and acquisitions that
occurred between 1968 and 1983. Approximately two-thirds of these mergers were
in the manufacturing sector, with the average acquiring firm approximately 10 times
larger than the acquired company. They found that a significant percentage of the com-
panies in their sample had various constraints on their ability to use their tax benefits.
Nonetheless, many of the companies realized tax benefits as a result of merging. The
average gain was 10.5% of the acquiring firm’s market value.13
Scholes and Wolfson studied the number of mergers and acquisitions for various
times, including the periods before 1981, between 1981 and 1986, and after 1986.14
The 1981 Tax Act provided various tax incentives for mergers and other forms of
restructuring. Some of these were eliminated in the tax reforms that were part of the
1986 Tax Act. They attribute part of the intensified level of merger activity to tax
motives that were put in place with the 1981 Act and eliminated by the 1986 Act.
Hayn analyzed 640 successful acquisitions between 1970 and 1985.15 In her sam-
ple,shenotedthat54%weretaxable,18%werepartiallytaxable,and28%weretax-free.
There were 279 tender offers in her sample, and the majority of them (64%) were tax-
able. Mergers, however, varied in tax status. Of the 361 mergers in her sample, 39% were
tax-free, whereas 46% were taxable and the remainder was partially taxable.
Hayn researched the role that the tax attributes of transactions played in determin-
ing abnormal returns for targets and acquirers. First, she noted that tax-free status is
a prerequisite of certain deals. Targets that do not receive such a status may decline to
continue with the deal and may look to other bidders who can structure the transaction
so that such a status is attained. Specifically, she found that “potential tax benefits
stemming from net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits positively affect
announcement period returns of firms involved in tax-free acquisitions, and capital
gains and the step-up in the acquired assets basis affects returns of firms involved in
taxable acquisitions.”16

Tax Issues in M&A
A study by Ayers, Lefanowicz, and Robinson looked at the impact of variations in the
capitalgainstaxratesovertimeandthevolumeofM&Aactivity.17 Theycomparedtrans-
actions that were tax-free, stock-for-stock exchanges with other taxable transactions,
such as cash for stock deals. In their study of acquisitions of publicly traded compa-
nies over the period 1973–2001, they found a negative association between acquisition
activity and the capital gains tax rate for individual investors. The results show that
capital gains tax policy represented significant transactions costs that, in turn, decrease
M&A activity during time periods when capital gains tax rates are relatively higher.
ROLE OF TAXES IN THE CHOICE OF SELL-OFF METHOD
When management has determined that it will separate a unit from the company, one of
the early decisions in that process is whether they are going to pursue a tax-free spinoff
or a sale that may cause the company to incur tax costs. Maydew, Schipper, and Vincent
analyzed 218 sales transactions and 52 nontaxable spinoffs.18 The authors assumed
that the sellers consider the trade-off between the tax costs of a sale and the acquisi-
tion premium they would derive from a sale, which would not be available in a tax-free
spinoff. They attempted to estimate what the premium would be in tax-free transactions
and reached the intuitive result that where attractive premiums could be achieved, the
taxable sale is pursued, and when that is not the case, there is a higher probability of a
tax-free spinoff.
ORGANIZATIONAL FORM AND M&A PREMIUMS
Scholes, Erickson, Maydew, and Shevlin postulated that S corporations and other
pass-through business entities, such as partnerships and limited liability companies,
should sell to premiums that can be explained in part by tax factors.19 This is because
asset base step-up is available in acquisitions of S corporations but is usually not
viable in the acquisitions of C corporations because the tax costs of the step-up usually
are greater than the tax benefits. To test the hypothesis that there is a difference in
premiums for acquisitions of S corporations compared to C corporations, Erickson
and Wang analyzed 77 pairs of taxable stock acquisitions of S corporations and C
corporations over the period between 1994–2000.20 As expected, they found that all
of the acquisitions of the S corporations in their sample were structured in a manner

that stepped up the tax basis of the acquired company’s assets. In addition, they found
that the acquisition multiples were higher for the S corporations compared to the C
corporations. Thus, we see that organization form does influence takeovers.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND PROPENSITY TO ENGAGE IN
ACQUISITIONS
Interest payments on debt are a tax-deductible expense, whereas dividend payments
from equity ownership are not. The existence of a tax advantage for debt is an incentive
to have greater use of debt, as opposed to equity, as the means of exchange in mergers
and acquisitions.
The leverage argument suggests that the acquiring firm has a suboptimal
debt–equity ratio and has not sufficiently used debt in its capital mix. The argument
goes on to put forward mergers and acquisitions as a means whereby companies can
achieve greater utilization of debt. An overly simplistic test of this hypothesis would
be to look at the debt–equity ratios before and after various mergers and acquisitions.
This test is considered overly simplistic because the acquiring corporation might retain
earnings for one or more years before an acquisition in anticipation of the takeover.
After the takeover, which might be financed with internal funds and borrowed capital,
there would be a sudden increase in the debt–equity ratio. This jump in the debt–equity
ratio may be offset by a gradual reduction over the years following the acquisition as
the firm moves to a long-term debt–equity ratio that it considers optimal.
The tax deductibility of interest payments is not an incentive to merge; rather, it is
an incentive to increase the potential acquiring firm’s borrowing and alter its capital
structure. This may be done in a much more cost-effective manner by issuing bonds
or directly borrowing from a lender than through the costly process of engaging in an
acquisition.
Auerbach and Reishus found that, contrary to popular belief, firms that merge
more frequently do not borrow more than firms that have exhibited less tendency to
merge.21 They also discovered that the long-term debt–equity ratios of firms in their
sample increased from 25.4% to only 26.7% after the mergers, which took place at a
time when debt–equity ratios were increasing throughout the economy. The Auerbach
and Reishus result may be less relevant to many of the private equity deals we saw
in the 2000s. Many private equity firms acquire targets with unused debt capacity
and engage in leveraged recapitalizations. In these deals, they acquire a target in a
going-private transaction, increase its debt, and take some or all of the debt proceeds
as a dividend. The acquired corporation then has a more levered capital structure that
in turn provides tax benefits to the corporation at the expense of a higher risk profile.
A somewhat similar situation is discussed in the following section when we describe
Kaplan’s research on the tax effects of management buyouts.
21 Ibid., 80.

Tax Issues in M&A
Leverage and Deal Structure
In a study of 340 corporation acquisitions during the years 1985–1988, Erickson found
that high tax rate acquirers were more likely to use debt to finance a transaction—a
result that is quite intuitive.22 In his study, the probability that an acquirer would use
debt as opposed to equity was an increasing function of the acquirer’s tax rates. He also
found that the probability of a debt-financed taxable cash transaction was an increasing
function of the acquirer’s debt-to-equity ratio. This later result is somewhat inconsistent
with the aforementioned findings of Auerbach and Reishus.
TAXES AS A SOURCE OF VALUE IN MANAGEMENT BUYOUTS
Taxes have quite a different role in management buyouts (MBOs) than they have in
mergers and acquisitions. Kaplan measured the value of tax benefits for 76 MBOs
between 1980 and 1986.23 In this sample of MBOs, the average premium was 42.3%
above the market price two months before the initial announcement of the buyout. The
median ratio of debt to total capital rose from 18.8% before the buyouts to 87.8% after-
ward. Kaplan found that the value of increased interest and depreciation deductions
ranged between 21.0% and 142.6% of the premium paid to prebuyout shareholders.
A regression analysis relating the total tax deductions generated by the buyout to the
premium available to prebuyout shareholders suggested that total tax deductions are
an important determining variable.
Leveraged Buyouts and Tax Revenues
Critics of LBOs contend that the tax deductibility of the debt used to finance these
transactions causes a loss in tax revenues for the U.S. Treasury. These critics assert
that, in effect, taxpayers are absorbing some of the financing costs of the LBOs. Jensen,
Kaplan, and Stiglin, however, argue that LBOs result in positive tax revenues for the
U.S. Treasury.24 They cite factors such as the increased efficiency of post-LBO firms,
which increases taxable income; tax payments on capital gains to shareholders; tax
payments on the interest income; and capital gains taxes paid on post-LBO asset sales
to support their position. Jensen and colleagues attempted to measure these factors for
a typical LBO.
For a typical LBO of $500 million, Jensen et al. estimated that incremental tax
revenues equal $226.9 million, with incremental tax losses equal to $116.9 million,
resulting in a net positive incremental tax revenue equal to $110 million. Scholes and

Reorganizations, Dale A. Oesterle, ed. (St. Paul, MN: West Publishing, 1991).

Wolfson criticized some of the assumptions used by Jensen et al.25 For example, they
focused on the assumption that the LBO would cause an increased value of the company
and its shares. They contend that it is reasonable that some of these gains would have
occurred anyway. They also point out that some of the capital gains preceding the
LBO would have resulted in capital gains for shareholders, some of whom would have
sold their shares even without the LBO. These criticisms and others they point out
would change the conclusions of the Jensen study. Scholes and Wolfson do not go so
far as to say that their suggested refinements would have wiped out all the positive
net incremental tax revenues noted by Jensen and colleagues. They simply state that
the result would be different and probably lower, but that it remains an open and
controversial issue.
Jensenetal.’sstudytakesahighlyfavorableviewofLBOsandtheirexpectedbenefits.
As a result of the concerns pointed out by Scholes and Wolfson, as well as the overly
positive view Jensen et al. take of the salutary effects of LBOs, we can conclude that the
case has not been made that LBOs have a positive net effect on tax revenues. In fact, if
anything, there probably is more concern that any effects may be negative.
MISCELLANEOUS TAX ISSUES
International Taxation and Cross-Border M&As
The parent–subsidiary structure of multinational companies that were created by
cross-border M&As may give rise to potential additional costs that non–cross-border
deals lack. By having a foreign subsidiary, the parent company may incur double
taxation in the form of corporate taxes in the foreign country and then possible taxes
on the repatriated dividend income in the home country. Recognizing this, some parent
countries exempt the dividend income received from foreign subsidiaries. For example,
this was the case when Germany exempted dividend income that could be received by
Daimler from Chrysler, thus increasing the potential value of Chrysler to Daimler.26
Huizinga and Voget have shown that countries that impose high rates of international
double taxation are less likely to attract foreign parent companies.27 This adverse effect
on foreign investment is why many countries, especially European countries, have
entered into bilateral treaties with each other to eliminate the double taxation. Indeed,
the European Union adopted the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, which eliminated the
taxation of intra-EU and intracompany dividend flows. Some countries, such as Great
Britain, have lowered their corporate tax rates several times in recent years while the
United States, with its flawed political system, stubbornly maintains the high double
taxation of corporate earnings. As we will discuss shortly, this has given an incentive
for foreign bidders to target U.S. companies.

Tax Inversions
In recent years, U.S. companies have struggled to deal with the very high corporate tax
rates in the United States, which are among the highest in the world (see Figures 16.1a
and 16.1b). U.S. politicians have been unwilling to take steps to change the law lest these
actions be used against them in their next election. The result is that multinational U.S.
companies are unwilling to repatriate foreign subsidiary profits lest they be subject to
the high U.S. tax rates. However, some have gone even further and have done mergers
with foreign companies located in countries with lower tax rates. In such deals, the U.S.
company may relocate its corporate headquarters to the other nation, and then it may
hope to be able to qualify for lower taxes. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service defines tax
inversions as follows:
A corporate inversion is a transaction in which a U.S.- parented multinational
group changes its tax residence to reduce or avoid paying U.S. taxes. More
specifically a U.S.-parented group engages in an inversion when it acquires
a smaller foreign company and then locates the tax residence of the merged
group outside the United States, typically a low tax country. Typically, the
primary purpose of an inversion is not to grow the underlying business,
maximize synergies, or pursue other commercial benefits. Rather, the primary
purpose of the transaction is to reduce taxes, often substantially.28
Basically, inverting companies move their corporate domicile to a foreign country
even though they may maintain their physical operations as they did prior to the
deal. Typically, the U.S. managers and other workers still work in their same locations.
The inversion creates a new parent company that is above both the United States

and the foreign company. This parent is incorporated in the foreign, lower tax rate,
country. Because profits generated by the U.S. subsidiary would still be subject to U.S.
tax rates, the overall corporate entity works to try to shift more profits outside of the
United States and into the lower taxed country.
One of the ways companies try to shift income to the lower taxed country is through
earnings stripping. Here, the U.S. subsidiary borrows money from the foreign subsidiary
and then the U.S. subsidiary deducts the interest as an expense to lower the U.S. taxes.
Size plays an important role in the ability of the U.S. acquirer to qualify for reduced
taxes. The IRS rules, specifically Section 7874, denies the tax benefit if the acquirer owns
80% or more of the combined company. Doing a small acquisition, one that could pro-
vide significant financial benefits through reduced taxes, could make great sense for a
U.S. acquirer even if the target would otherwise not be of interest.
The IRS enacted various new rules over the period 2014–2016, which reduced
the types of companies that could qualify for tax-reducing inversions and also limited the
effectiveness of earnings stripping by not considering debt that a U.S. unit may issue if it
didnotresultinnewinvestmentsintheUnitedStates.Thenewrulesalsolimitedtheabil-
ity of a foreign merger partner to “beef up” its size by acquiring several U.S. companies

Tax Holidays and M&As
It has been estimated that in 2017, U.S. companies held an estimated $2.5 trillion in
cash outside the United States in an effort to avoid the high U.S. corporate tax rates.29
The company with the largest amount of cash is Apple, which in 2017 reported cash
balances of $257 billion with 90% of it housed outside the United States.30 This has
given rise to a call for a tax holiday that would allow U.S. companies to bring back these
monies and be taxed at a much lower rate. What would such companies do with
these monies? Perhaps we can get guidance from the last time such a policy was
pursued in the United States. In 2004, the United States enacted the “American Jobs
Creation Act” (AJCA), which resulted in U.S. foreign subsidiaries giving their parents in
excess of $300 billion.
There was significant criticism of the 2004 tax holiday. Some alleged that the com-
panies that repatriated the monies not only did not create more jobs with the funds but
might have actually cut jobs.31 Companies were restricted in how they could use the
repatriatedcash,eventhough,realistically,thegovernmenthadlimitedabilitytoenforce
some of these restrictions, as money is fungible.
Thomas Brennan analyzed the repatriations made by the 20 largest U.S. compa-
nies, which accounted for 56% of all reparations, with an eye toward determining how

they used the funds.32 He found that $0.72 of each repatriated dollar was spent on
permissible uses. Of this total, $0.49 was spent on M&As! An example was Oracle, which
did two acquisitions after receiving the funds, including the hotly fought Peoplesoft hos-
tile deal and the acquisitions of Retek. The two deals came to roughly $11 billion, which
is an amount that corresponded closely to the monies Oracle repatriated. Thus, if the
last tax 2004 holiday is a guide, another U.S. tax holiday may mean more M&A activity.
Foreign Cash Holdings and M&As
Do the large holdings outside the U.S. give rise to less beneficial foreign acquisitions? The
reasoning is that it may be more difficult to use, even indirectly, the foreign holdings to
finance a U.S. acquisition. Therefore, acquisitive U.S. companies may choose to acquire
foreign targets—some of which may not have been their first choice.
To avoid repatriation, the acquisitions have to be done by the foreign subsidiary.
Edwards, Kravet, and Wilson analyzed the profitability and announcement effects of
foreign acquisition by U.S. parents before and after the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, which allowed for repatriation.33 They found that, in general, foreign acquisi-
tions by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms had lower announcement period returns, lower
buy-and-hold returns, and decreased returns on assets. These effects were reduced after
the passage of the 2004 Act. Thus, they found a basis for the assertion that corporate
cash that was held abroad for tax reasons caused U.S. companies to make less desirable
acquisitions.
Taxes and Golden Parachutes
The Internal Revenue Code imposes a 20% excise tax on excess parachute payments.
Deductions for such excess payments are not allowed. The excess amount of such
compensation is defined as the amount that is greater than the compensation during a
five-year base period. There are some exceptions, such as when it can be established that
the payments were reasonable in relation to the specific services that were provided.
Taxes and Termination Fees
Termination fees paid by a winning bidder, such as the $1.8 billion paid by Pfizer to
American Home Products (now Wyeth) after Pfizer’s successful bid for Warner Lambert
in 2000, may be tax-deductible. This arises out of a 1994 decision by a federal court in
which monies paid to an unsuccessful white knight were found to be deductible if they
were a separate transaction—that is, separate from the transaction that was eventually
consummated.34 The transactions are regarded as mutually exclusive if only one can
