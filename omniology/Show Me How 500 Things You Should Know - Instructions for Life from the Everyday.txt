a note from derek and lauren
As long as either one o f us can remember, w e've always loved 
collecting and sharing obscure, eclectic, and occasionally 
(som ewhat) useful knowledge. O u r passion for learning has even 
inspired a great monthly tradition w here w e get together with 
friends to  teach each other how to do cool, sometimes slightly 
ridiculous things— everything from making our own jam (delicious!) to  twisting 
balloon animals (dazzles children and coworkers alike!). These days, w e own a fun 
little shop where w e encourage people to  do all sorts o f curious things, like make 
duct-tape wallets, crochet little creatures, and build musical instruments. So we 
w ere thrilled when the Show  M e Team  asked us to  pitch in and help bnng this 
fantastic book into the w orld— a world 
that so clearly needs simple, step-by-step 
instructions for crafting clay monsters (# 8), 
making rugs from old grocery bags (#238), 
and escaping from panthers (#434).
In fact w e bet that before reading this note from us. you'd already 
flipped through the book a few tim es and learned some neat 
tncks. If you’re like Derek and really want to cover your bases, read 
it straight through, cover to  cover. If you prefer to  focus on 
improving certain areas o f your life in a m ore organized fashion 
like Lauren, let your interests guide you from topic to topic. O r 
better yet invite some fnends over and explore the book together. 
Show  Me H ow  is designed to educate, amuse, and occasionally 
astound. So if each tim e you pick it up you also pick up a few 
skills — o r simply feel inspired to get out there and leam a new 
* * * * 
w eird or wonderfu thing— then w e've done our job.

DEREK loves tending to his bees (#278. #333), teasing 
out a tune on his saw (#469), indulging in his obsessions 
with cofTee (# 126-130). and going on camping trips 
(#404). He's thnlled that his work on Show Me How has 
improved his knot-tying skills (#395). and he anxiously 
awaits the opportunity to test out his newly acquired 
ability to correctly hug a hedgehog (#287).
LAUREN is a bom craften and can while away hours 
knitting (#48), embroidering (#50). or doing paper crafts 
(# 18). She's always looking for an excuse to bust out the 
ol' tool box. and is determined to install dimmer switches 
(#239) in every room of the house. And though she is 
fearless when it comes to hanging wallpaper (#221), she 
never, never, never wants to fight a shark (#452)— but 
she’s glad she knows how if the need ever arises!
