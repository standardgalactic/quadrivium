by the United States government to participate in an overseas

Authors’ Acknowledgments
We acknowledge with love and gratitude the support, love, and
inspiration from our spouses, Richard Glaser and Diane E. Lavin,
without whom this work could not have been completed. It was
they who helped us reach, explore, learn, and share. With our grati-
tude and love, we also want to acknowledge our children. It was
they who taught us with their love how to guide and still love.
We thank Alison Blake, who has done an extraordinary job of helping
us fashion this book into a format that is enjoyable, and familiar to 
all the world that loves the For Dummies series. To our acquisitions
editor, Tracy Boggier, we remain grateful for the initial idea of this
book, the opportunity to make it so widely available. To our project
editor, Kristin DeMint, and our copy editor, Pam Ruble, many thanks
for a wonderful working relationship and invaluable editing as our
manuscript came to life. Finally, to our agent, Margot Maley
Hutchison, thank you for bringing us together with Wiley Publishing,
bringing our insights and passion for parenting to light.
Dr. Lavin: No one learns alone, and I would like to thank those who
most helped me think about caring for children and their families:
Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, Dr. Mel Levine, Dr. F. Sessions Cole, Dr. Phil
Hill, Dr. Jerry Hass, Dr. Alan Nauss, Dr. Francis Rushton, Dr. Cal Sia,
and the Division of Community Pediatrics of the American Academy
of Pediatrics.  All the important threads in my professional develop-
ment came together in our office, Advanced Pediatrics. I thank our
wonderful team of staff and professionals who every day reach out
to families and offer what is needed most: a listening ear, an eager-
ness to help, and a commitment to offer the best expertise possible.
Ultimately the greatest honor is to be asked to help someone, so I
deeply thank the families who have placed the greatest gift, their
trust, into my hands.
Ms. Glaser: I wish to thank Dr. Jane Kessler, who was my mentor at
the Mental Development Center of Case Western Reserve University;
Eleanor Wiesberger, who inspired me to write a book about parents
based on practical, developmentally appropriate ideas that work;
my colleagues at the Jewish Community Center, especially Cindy
Bruder and Barb McDonald, who were my touchstones for sharing
ideas and strategies; and Judith Pitlick and Devra Adlestein, with
whom I shared long walks and longer discussions about children’s
development. And most of all, I thank the young parents who have
entered my life and allowed me to become part of theirs while their
families grew and developed.

sleepy-time schedule in your home. Whether your sweetie fusses
at tuck-in-time, squawks all night long, or hops out of his bed and
into yours, we have the answers that help you take control of the
night (and naptimes, too). So cheer up — help is here, and a peace-
ful night’s sleep is on the way.
About This Book
If you feel like you’re flat out of answers trying to get your sweetie
to snooze, you’re not alone. Millions of parents try those one-size-
fits-all sleep strategies, and find out that — guess what — they
don’t fit every tot or every parent.
That’s not surprising, because one-size doesn’t fit all babies and 
toddlers. And that’s why we don’t recommend a cookie-cutter
approach to sleep issues. Instead, we help you tailor a strategy
that’s a custom fit for you and your sweetie. We base our tech-
niques on a simple, tried-and-true principle: The best way to solve
any baby or toddler issue is to let your child participate in the solu-
tion. Between the two of us, we’ve helped more than 10,000 families
use this strategy successfully — and that’s a lot of peace and quiet!
Making your child an active player in the sleep game avoids the
twin pitfalls of tough love (crying it out) or passively hoping the
problem will go away. Here’s the foundation for our successful

approach: Your child creates the problem of interrupting your
sleep (and often your privacy), so only your child can solve this
problem — with your loving guidance. Two elements are key to
your role in this process:
 Your expectation that you’re entitled to the sleep and privacy
you need.
 Your knowledge that your angel can’t be traumatized by your
loving but firm guidance as she finds the solutions to her
sleep issues.
When you put these pieces into place and combine them with the
clear-cut, easy-to-use interventions we offer, you’re on the road to
peaceful nights and happy, well-rested days.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you find what you want quickly, we use a few conventions
in our typeface.
 Italic is used to highlight new terms that we define in the text.
 Boldface is used to indicate the action part of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used for Web and e-mail addresses.
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, you can read every word if you want to! In fact, we’ll be
very happy if you do. But if you want to cut to the chase, feel free
to ignore the sidebars (the gray boxes sprinkled throughout these
pages). These sidebars are filled with valuable and entertaining tid-
bits, but you can ignore them and still master the sleep strategies
we describe. You can also browse past the paragraphs marked

 You’re fairly new at the parenting game — not necessarily a
first-time parent but probably not the parent of a dozen kids
either.
 You have a child — whether an infant or a growing toddler —
who just won’t sleep the way you think he should.
 You’re a kind and caring parent who’s looking for sleep strate-
gies that are both effective and loving.
 You want simple, no-frills advice without lots of jargon or
technical details.

How This Book Is Organized
Baby & Toddler Sleep Solutions For Dummies is divided into five
parts so you can quickly find the information that’s just right for
your child’s age, your needs, and any special circumstances that
affect your tot’s sleep. Here’s a quick look at what you’ll find in
each part.
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: 
The Basics of Sleep
In this part, we offer the background info that helps set the stage
for a successful sleep strategy. In Chapter 1, we introduce the most
important themes about sleep and explain how to tell the differ-
ence between your child’s wants and needs — a big key to taking
charge of the nights around your house. Chapter 2 describes the
basics of baby and toddler sleep including what it is and how it
develops so you know what to realistically expect from your angel,
whether she’s 3 days or 3 years old. In Chapter 3 we talk about the
important role that personality — both yours and your tot’s —
plays in designing a sleep plan that works for everyone in your
household.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning
Sleep Strategies for Every Age
Part II is where you find sleep-promoting approaches for each age
and stage of your baby’s or toddler’s development. If your sweetie
is under 6 months old, turn to Chapter 4 for info about when and
how to establish a sleep schedule. Chapter 5 offers advice for the
Introduction
3

6-months-to-1-year-old crowd including how to establish a bedtime
routine and how to manipulate mealtimes to promote longer
stretches of sleep. In Chapter 6, you find out how to cope with a 
12- to 18-month-old and get important advice on handling that big
sleep disruptor called separation anxiety. Chapter 7 talks about
toddlers in the 18-month to 2-year range. We cover how to use lan-
guage to enhance your sleep strategies; how to handle nightmares,
night terrors, and sleepwalking or sleep-talking; and how (and
when) to make that big switch from crib to bed. Chapter 8 covers
the 2-to-3-year-old gang including that all-important question: How
do you juggle a sleep schedule with potty training?
Part III: Sleep Decisions that
Involve the Whole Family
This part takes a look at sleep issues that affect every person in
your household. In Chapter 9, we examine the advantages and
drawbacks of co-sleeping — that is, sharing your bedroom or even
your bed with your tot — and explain how to co-sleep safely.
Chapter 10 focuses on siblings and includes tips on twins and
sleep issues that arise if you adopt. In Chapter 11, we talk about
babysitters, childcare, and preschool, and we explain how to
ensure that your child-care decisions foster sound sleep at night.
Part IV: Dealing with Special
Circumstances
This part offers additional advice for parents dealing with some 
of life’s big and small challenges. In Chapter 12, we talk about the
sleep issues of premature infants; we describe swaddling and other
techniques to enhance an early bird’s slumber. Chapter 13 dis-
cusses what to do if your sweetie comes down with a short-term
bug or has a long-term medical issue. And in Chapter 14, we
explain how life’s changes, major or minor, can send your tot’s
sleep schedule into a tailspin — and what you can do to restore
peace and quiet.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this special For Dummies feature, we offer fun and helpful tips to
round out your sleep know-how. Chapter 15 provides 10 of our best
ideas for getting babies and toddlers to sleep. Chapter 16 does just
Baby & Toddler Sleep Solutions For Dummies

the opposite; it describes 10 sleep pitfalls to avoid. And in Chapter
17, we offer 10 of the all-time best songs, games, and stories for
bedtime.
Icons Used in This Book
As you’re reading, you’ll spot icons in the margins next to the text.
These can steer you to information that’s useful, informative,
funny, or important to your child’s safety. These icons can be real
time-savers if you’re looking for specific information, so keep an

Part I
From A to ZZZZZ:
The Basics of Sleep

In this part . . .
Your new life as a proud parent is ﬁlled with joys and
thrills . . . and plenty of sleepless nights! But with a
little luck — and the help of our practical tips — you’ll be
snoozing soundly before long. In Chapter 1, you discover
why your game face is so important to success in the
sleep wars. Chapter 2 ﬁrst tells you how and why babies
and toddlers sleep and then what you can expect as your
baby’s sleep patterns mature. And in Chapter 3, we
describe why ß isn’t just a song title — it’s also a key to
tailoring sleep strategies for your tot’s (and your!) needs.

Chapter 1
Taking Charge of Your 
Dream Team
In This Chapter
 Accepting the rules of the first few months
 Getting it straight: Trauma versus disappointment, wants versus needs
 Plotting a new, improved course of action
 Trading up: From guilt to self-confidence
You’re a grownup, smart and experienced. And you have lots of
skills — you can scramble an egg, ride a bicycle, and balance
a checkbook. Your child, in contrast, is a little person. He’s smart
too, but he really doesn’t know much yet.
So you’re probably wondering, “Why does he keep winning the
bedtime battles?”
The answer is simple: Right now, your child is deciding when it’s
sleepytime and when it isn’t. But the solution is also simple: You
need to change the rules.
Luckily, you can accomplish this mission in a loving way that
strengthens the bond between you and your sweetie. In fact, 
when you help him sleep on his own, you lay the groundwork for 
a strong, happy relationship. In this chapter, we tell you when and
how to prepare for this big step — and, most importantly, why it’s
the right one for both you and your child.
In the Beginning . . . 
Baby’s in Charge
The whole world is new to your baby, but she enters it fully
equipped for those all-important basics: eating, sleeping, peeing,
and pooping. The catch, of course, is that she does these on her

schedule, not yours! That’s okay when it’s peeing and pooping —
but those non-stop wake-up calls in the middle of the night can
leave you bleary-eyed and fuzzy-brained.
However, when your newborn hollers every few hours, she’s doing
just what she’s supposed to do. In the early weeks, your baby
simply isn’t ready to sleep through the night. (Yes, we know, a few
tots do — but they’re the exception, not the rule.)
Your newborn needs you to wait on her each time she wakes up
because she’s growing like a weed and has to eat every few hours
to meet her calorie demands (see Chapter 4). Besides, her sleep
cycles are too immature for her to make it through the night. In
Chapter 2, we explain why sleep is more than just closing your
eyes and why your baby needs to grow into mature sleep patterns
before she can conk out for more than a few hours.
When your little angel gets past those calorie and sleep-pattern
hurdles, she’s ready for an all-night snooze. Almost all children hit
this mark between 4 and 6 months of age. Of course, each tot’s
unique, and some reach this point a few weeks after birth — but
the closer she gets to 4 months of age, the more certain you can be
that your infant can sleep all night without interruption. (For ways
to make her even more ready, see Chapter 5.) But at that point,
another question arises: Are you ready?
Conquering Your Fears about
Taking the Big Step
Even though you can now pick your moment for getting your
sweetie to doze through the night, one qualm may hold you back —
the fear that somehow you’ll emotionally damage your little love-
bug by being firm with him.
But the fact that you’re reading this book means you want to handle
your tyke’s sleep problems in a kind and nurturing way. So here’s
good news: Helping your babe figure out how to fall asleep on his
own doesn’t hurt him a bit. In fact, you’ll do him — and you — a
world of good.
The big misunderstanding: Trauma
versus disappointment
The first secret to raising kids is knowing the huge difference
between trauma and disappointment. Yes, you’ll disappoint your
From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
10

sweetie when you stop letting him call the shots at bedtime — but
no, he won’t be the least bit traumatized. In fact, he’ll take a giant
step toward becoming a well-adjusted little person.
So what’s the big difference between trauma and disappointment?
Check out the following explanations:
 A trauma is a terrible event that shakes a child to the core,
challenges his belief that the world is a safe place, and causes
long-term emotional distress — for instance, the death of
someone he loves or abandonment by the people he trusts.
Traumas occur when serious needs are denied, and they
cause grave harm.
 Disappointments, on the other hand, are tiny clouds that pass,
causing no harm at all. They’re simply unanswered desires
that occur when people create expectations that can’t be 
fulfilled — and they’re the stuff of daily life.
Fortunately, traumas happen far less often than disappointments.
Of course, everyone wants to skate through life free of both trau-
mas and disappointments — and caring parents certainly strive to
keep both to a minimum. But it’s important not to mistake minor
disappointments for serious traumas because this mistake can
hinder both you and your child. What’s more, it’s a common trap
for parents.
Why is it so easy to make this mistake? To get an idea, picture 
an 8-month-old crying up a storm at 2 a.m. Because his parents
weaned him from the nighttime bottle two months ago, they know
he isn’t hungry. They’re also sure he isn’t sick, in pain, or simply
stuck. In reality, he’s just trying to wake up Mommy and Daddy, 
get them out of bed, and enjoy a little snuggle. But even after they
make sure nothing’s really wrong (see the yellow tear-out card 
at the front of this book), his parents believe they’re hearing the
primal scream of a child terrified by the impending trauma of
parental abandonment. It’s a classic case of mistaken identity —
the disappointed infant masquerading as a broken-hearted child 
in a life crisis.
Why does this confusion matter? Because if you think your infant
is about to suffer irreparable harm, your only option is to give in.
In fact, when you let this mistaken idea direct your actions, you’re
unable to offer your child any guidance — now or later — for fear
that lifelong damage may ensue. And this fear can leave you para-
lyzed by doubt and worry, making any effective course of action
impossible and inevitably getting in the way of your tot’s growth
and development.
Chapter 1: Taking Charge of Your Dream Team 11

What’s more, the impossible task of preventing all disappointments
can leave you exhausted and resentful. You’re much smarter to
show your little huggy-bear that frustrations come with all new life
skills — from tying his shoes, to playing with friends, to managing a
Fortune-500 company — and sleeping on a schedule is one of the
very first.
So as you get ready to turn over a new leaf in your household,
brace yourself for a very interesting turn of events as you put your
tot in charge of his own sleep. If you hear complaints — and we’re
pretty sure you will! — see them for what they are: reactions to a
minor disappointment, not a major trauma. Remember, too, that
this is an exciting moment. When you tell your sweetie in words
and actions that he’s ready to sleep through the night, you’re
demonstrating your confidence in his ability to master this first
big-kid skill.
Your biggest challenge:
Distinguishing between 
wants and needs
Watching your sweetie’s face scrunch up and hearing her wail
when she doesn’t get what she wants can be tough, we know. But
you can expect this reaction more than once when you implement
your sleep strategy.
However, the key to your child’s sleep — and every other aspect of
her life — is remembering that wants aren’t needs. As a parent, you
make sure your child has everything she needs, but that doesn’t
mean you give her everything she wants.
For the first few months of your baby’s life, you can easily distinguish
her wants from her needs — because she needs you for everything!
Somewhere around that 4- to 6-month mark, however, she doesn’t
need you as much as you think.
With each passing month, your little one is able to do more, under-
stand more, and be more independent. However, she’s also accus-
tomed to being with you — her 24-hour on-call buddy — and she’s
not going to give up that arrangement easily.
Like a kid in a candy store, your tot has trouble knowing the differ-
ence between what she wants from you and what she needs from
you. And as a loving, nurturing, and very tired parent, you don’t
always know the difference either. But if you can make this distinc-
tion between wants and needs and make it early in the game, your
life and your child’s can be happier.
From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
12

Of course, older kids’ wants and needs are easier to sort out than
babies’ and toddlers’. (In fact, we outline different sleep strategies
for kids at different ages and stages in Part II of this book because
what works for an 8-month-old can be very different from what
works for a 3-year-old.) But making the distinction is key to your
sleep strategy. To help you tell the difference, here’s a quick run-
down of your little one’s needs versus her wants.
Your baby needs the following from you:
 Plenty of food — on demand at first, and at regular intervals
later on
 Love, cuddles, rocking, gentle touching, and the sound of 
your voice
 Safety and security
 Interaction that develops her language and stimulates her
development
 Consistent caregivers to help her develop trust and attachment
 Proper medical care to keep her happy and healthy
 Lots of diaper changes!
In contrast, here’s what your baby or toddler wants from you:
 You, you, you, every minute of every day and — as the old
Beatles’ song goes — “eight days a week.”
 Lots of inappropriate stuff — like your permission to stick
her finger in a light socket or put the cat in the toilet — 
especially in those first months of toddlerhood, when she 
discovers the amazing wonders of the world around her
(more on this stage in Chapter 6).
 Power
Power is simply the ability to change what someone else does,
and politicians and movie villains aren’t the only power-mad
people. The average tot is quite able — and very willing — to
use her power when she desires control over Mommy or Daddy.
 Everything else her little heart desires — right now!
Do you see a lot of overlap between the preceding wants and
needs lists? Nope. Yet loving parents often worry so much about
upsetting their children that they give into every demand, no
matter how unreasonable. As a result, they keep their little ones
from finding the boundaries all children seek: the line where their
parents say “No” and the rules their parents really care about.
Chapter 1: Taking Charge of Your Dream Team 13

Understanding the need for limits
Of course, your child can get what he wants — he just can’t get
what he wants every time, and some of his demands will simply be
unreasonable. When he’s 6 years old, for instance, he’ll want the
fad toy that costs a fortune and breaks on the first day. At 10, he’ll
beg for junk food every day. And when he’s 16, he’ll want you to
buy him a brand-new sports car you can’t afford.
You know parents who give in to all of their kids’ demands,
whether they’re sensible wishes or not. These kids scream for
candy in the grocery store and have ear-splitting tantrums on the
playground when they don’t win every game. They stay up till 2
a.m. watching television and then struggle through school half-
asleep the next day. Somewhere along the line, their parents find
out the hard way that children actually crave and need limits. A kid
whose every wish is granted keeps pushing and expanding his
demands, always seeking the line his parents never draw.
When you draw that line, you give your child a gift that’s second
only to love: guidance. And coupled with your love, this guidance
tells him you’ll keep him safe and sound. A child whose Mom and
Dad set loving limits learns early to have reasonable expectations
and be very happy when they’re met.
Changing Your Tot’s Expectations —
and Yours
If you’re the Queen of England, you have pretty high expectations.
Your tiara needs to sparkle, your palaces need to be spotless, and
high tea had better include those little cucumber sandwiches.
If you’re a regular person, however, you’re probably happy if your
partner cooks breakfast or your dog fetches the paper. And if the
next-door neighbor drops off a batch of home-made cookies, you’re
in heaven.
What’s our point? That people base much of their happiness on
what they expect from life. You don’t expect dozens of servants 
to wait on you hand-and-foot, so you’re perfectly happy without
them. The queen, however, would be mighty unhappy if she had 
to scrub your toilet and water your ficus.
Babies and toddlers, just like grownups, are happy when life meets
their expectations. But right now, that’s a problem for you because
From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
14

your child expects you to appear on demand at any hour of the
night. As a result, he’ll be as mad as a queen with a tarnished tiara
if you don’t show your face on schedule.
To tweak his royal stance, you need to change his expectation —
but it isn’t likely to change until you take the first step, by 
changing yours.
Refocusing your thoughts
Before your munchkin can change her expectations, you need to
change two of your own. First, expect her to take charge of the
issue at hand: her. Second, expect her to put up a fuss when you
ask her to do this. Be prepared to react (or not, as the case may
be) to this resistance.
You can help change your expectations by keeping these facts 
in mind:
 You and your tot have different jobs. Your sweetie’s job is to
demand lots of stuff because that’s how she figures out what’s
reasonable and what isn’t. Your job, in turn, is to set limits so
she can figure out the rules of life.
For instance, if she says, “I want an elephant,” your job isn’t to
rush out and get her one. Your job is to explain why she’s not
getting one.
 To maintain a healthy lifestyle, both you and your child
need regular, uninterrupted sleep. A good night’s sleep is
important for your whole household, and your tot will still
love you every bit as much when you stop popping out of bed
at all hours to entertain her. When you recognize these truths,
you’re halfway down the road to a solid sleep solution. At this
point you’re ready to gently and lovingly teach your child a
brand-new expectation: I’m not going to get lots of attention if
I squawk when I wake up, so I’ll just happily go back to sleep
on my own. Period.
 Giving in has a big downside. When you cave in and satisfy
an unreasonable demand, your child’s first thought is some-
thing like, “Wow! I got Mommy and Daddy to give me a bottle
when I didn’t need it!” But her next thought is something like,
“Hmm . . . now, how do I get a bottle twice a night? How far 
can I push my demands before they draw the line?” And if you
never set reasonable limits, she’s likely to start worrying, “Uh-
oh — how can I feel safe if Mommy and Daddy don’t really
respond to my pushing the limits?”
Chapter 1: Taking Charge of Your Dream Team 15

Strengthening your hand 
at the negotiating table
Many families have at least one tot who simply refuses to sleep
through the night. This is the tyke who figures out how to keep the
rest of the family members popping up like prairie dogs all night
long for months, even years.
Often, the mommies and daddies in these families are skilled 
negotiators — lawyers, sales people, or even CEOs who negotiate
for a living. Yet every night, these parents get outmaneuvered by a
tiny being. How is this possible?
The answer is that even very young babies negotiate — and often
they drive hard bargains! Most people think of negotiation as a
tough adults-only event, like union bosses sitting at a table with
corporate lawyers or company administrators discussing big merg-
ers. But negotiation is simply a situation in which two people want
different outcomes; they interact to see how it’ll turn out.
In your case, negotiation occurs whenever your baby wants some-
thing different than you do at bedtime. At the outset, you’re in
opposing corners: Your baby wants to be awake with you, and you
want to sleep all night. Only a negotiation can settle the difference.
Right now, your baby is winning that negotiation hands down
because he’s using his one big tool: screaming. If you think about
it, that’s all he has to throw at the situation. He can’t e-mail you,
write a letter, call you on the phone, talk it over, or even pay you 
to come see him at 2 a.m. But then, he doesn’t need to, does he?
As long as you go to your tot each time he opens his mouth and
yells, you lose at the parent-child negotiation game. The instant
you realize that you hold the moral high ground (because a good
night’s sleep is beneficial for both of you), you can stop investing
so much power in your tyke’s strategy and start setting your own
terms. In Part II of this book, we tell you how to change the rules of
the nighty-night game and walk away from the bedtime negotia-
tions with a deal that works for both of you.
Factoring in your tot’s personality
and other issues
If a single blueprint could solve every tot’s sleep problems, this
book would be about six pages long. However, because each child
is unique, you need to take your tot’s personality — in addition to
From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
16

her age and development — into account. These factors, as well as
your own unique style, play a big role in planning your approach to
the bedtime negotiations, as we explain in Chapter 3.
In addition, your bedtime strategy needs to make allowances for a
host of special circumstances that can influence your expectations
of your little sweetie. Among them:
 A 4-month-old premature baby can’t snooze through the night,
and a tot with asthma can’t doze peacefully if she’s wheezing.
In Chapters 12 and 13, we look at adaptations that promote
sleep if your tot is an early bird or has medical issues.
 A little darling who’s coping with a big life-change like a new
sibling or her parents’ divorce has more trouble sleeping than
a tot whose life is on an even keel. As a result, she needs a
little special handling — a topic we cover in Chapter 14.
 If you’re co-sleeping with your tot, something we discuss in
Chapter 9, you need to handle the big switch when your
sweetie heads off to her own bed.
 Potty-training adds a new twist to the bedtime story, and you
need a strategy for making a good night’s sleep and dry pants
a reality (an issue we cover in Chapter 8).
 Is your sweetie a sleepwalker or sleep-talker? Does she experi-
ence those bizarre episodes called sleep terrors? If so, you need
to know why these events occur and what you should and
shouldn’t do about them — a topic we discuss in Chapter 7.
 If your little cub is starting day care or preschool soon, you
can expect some sleep setbacks. Chapter 11 offers advice on
getting her back on track.
Sleep routines get even more complicated when you have more
than one child because each tyke comes with her own set of 
needs, wants, and personality quirks — and if the sibs are twins 
or triplets, you really have your hands full! (We offer tips on all 
of these topics in Chapter 10.)
Setting Yourself Up for Success
Ready to say “Goodbye” to sleepless nights and “Hello” to sweet
dreams? If so, it’s time to get in the right frame of mind for the chal-
lenge ahead. Here are two more key pieces to put in place before
you start.
Chapter 1: Taking Charge of Your Dream Team 17

Losing the guilt
Still feeling a twinge of guilt about expecting your tot to sleep
through the night? If so, you’re only human. (In fact, if you’re not
feeling guilty about something on a regular basis, you’re not yet a
parent!)
Maybe you’re thinking, “I’m doing this for my own sake because
I’m so tired of getting up.” And of course, that’s true — you have
needs, and one of them is sleep! In truth, however, you’re really
taking this step for your child because
 This is the first big solution he gets to come up with in his
little life.
 When he figures out how to comfort himself to sleep and stay
in his own bed all night long, he gets a big shot of confidence.
This self-assurance makes future steps toward independence
(staying with a babysitter, using the potty, and so on) much
easier for him to master.
 When your sweetie sleeps long and soundly, he’s rested and
ready to face the day.
Even more important, your child needs you to be well-rested! Just
think of all the jobs you do and why you can do them better when
you’re not droopy and baggy-eyed:
 You’re his personal driver. Not surprisingly, a rested driver is
a safer driver. About 100,000 car crashes occur in the United
States each year because drivers are sleepy.
 You’re his best teacher. Exploring the wonderful world together
is lots more fun when you’re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
 You’re the light of his life. Your baby adores you, and he
needs you to stay happy and healthy. Staying well-rested
helps protect you from lots of medical problems (including
postpartum depression if you’re a new mom). In fact, accord-
ing to an important study in Pediatrics (May 2007), moderate
or severe sleep problems in infants nearly double the chance
that mothers will experience severe psychological distress
and poor overall health — even if they have no mental health
issues before delivery. For dads, the odds of developing poor
overall health go up 50 percent when infants have significant
sleep problems.
As professionals, we’ve met thousands of new parents. The
happiest ones are the parents who lovingly set limits on sleep
and other aspects of their tots’ lives, not the ones who wearily
(and then resentfully) cater to their tot’s whims.

 You’re his rudder. Whether he realizes it or not, your little
cherub counts on you to guide him through the sometimes
choppy waters of childhood. If you don’t offer guidance at 
the simpler stages early on — and sleep is one — he won’t be
confident that you can help him through more difficult times
that are sure to come.
To keep all of your family strong, happy, and full of bounce (and to
strengthen your relationship with your little one), nothing beats a
good night’s sleep.
Gaining the confidence 
that leads to success
Your baby’s birth begins a lifelong dance. Sometimes she leads and
you follow; other times, you need to take her firmly by the hand
and show her some new steps. The trick is knowing when to lead
and when to follow because your goal is to give her everything she
needs while encouraging her to stand on her own two feet (or lie
on her own pillow, in this case!).
Earlier generations of parents had an easier time making these
decisions. For centuries, people raised their kids very much like
their own parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents did.
But today’s families often live hundreds of miles from their closest
kin. As a result, Moms and Dads have a harder time knowing
whether they’re doing the best they can for their tots.
Chapter 1: Taking Charge of Your Dream Team 19
Making sure you’re in good shape
Depression is very common, affecting up to 25 percent of all people at any one time.
And it’s also one of the most common threats to feeling good as a new parent; in
fact, at least 10 percent of all mothers experience postpartum depression.
Our advice? Always seek treatment for depression. In fact, as a new parent, you have
an especially good reason: your baby’s well-being. A parent’s depression strongly
affects a newborn, infant, or child, and in particular can result in sleep problems.
So as you prepare to tackle your tot’s sleep issues, be sure to start with this ques-
tion: Do I have any signs of depression? These signs include sadness, change in
appetite, loss of energy (beyond what you’d expect as a new parent), and loss of
interest in life or in your baby. If you have any concerns, call your obstetrician or a
qualified counselor right away. Also, see Postpartum Depression For Dummies by
Shoshana S. Bennett and Mary Jo Codey (Wiley).

If your child’s lack of sleep is causing stress in your life, you’re not
alone; at least one-third of all families have the same problem!
We’ve counseled more than 10,000 of these families, and with very
rare exceptions (usually when the tots or their parents have other,
very serious life issues), the techniques we describe in this book
work like a charm.
In the following chapters we offer you lots of information and
plenty of advice because we want you to tackle your tot’s sleep
routine with confidence. We believe the more you know about
sleep and good strategies, the more easily you can lovingly smooth
your child’s path to Slumberland. So rest easy — you’re doing the
right thing, and everyone (including your little night owl) will be
better off!

Stories from the crib: A declaration 
of independence
Latrice, a nurse with three kids under the age of 4, felt guilty about her middle child,
Lamont. Lamont was only 1 year old when Latrice became pregnant with his little
brother, and she felt bad that Lamont didn’t get to be the baby for long. To add to her
guilt, Lamont — unlike his brothers — didn’t adjust well to childcare.
At 2 years of age, Lamont still woke up twice each night. Latrice offered him a bottle
each time to get him back to sleep. She dragged through her work days and dreaded
the nights, but she couldn’t break the cycle.
Finally, Latrice attended a parenting workshop where she learned to tell the differ-
ence between Lamont’s needs and his wants. She also realized that her guilt kept
her trapped in an intolerable routine.
Using the strategies from the workshop, Latrice devised a sleep plan and stuck to
it. First, she weaned Lamont from his middle-of-the-night bottles. Next, she stopped
running to him when he cried and let him comfort himself to sleep.
A few weeks later, Latrice showed up at the parenting group and announced, “My
life has changed!” Lamont was now sleeping through the night, and the newly-ener-
gized Latrice could offer him quality time in the mornings and evenings — instead
of at 2 a.m.!

P
icture yourself, head on your pillow, happily dreaming away.
As you’re traipsing along in dreamland, your heart is pumping
blood, your lungs are breathing, and everything else is chugging
along — a little more slowly than in the day, but not by much. Your
brain, which labors so hard during the day, is also working away.
Even though people tend to think of sleep as rest, the body doesn’t
really quit. In fact, nearly every organ in the body works just as
hard during sleep. So what good is it, and why do people need it 
so much if nothing’s really resting?
Although the pros still don’t know exactly why people need sleep,
they do know that the brain, more than any other part of the
human body, needs it. Your skin works whether you sleep or not
and so does your heart, bones, and kidneys. But skip a single night
of snoozing, and your brain starts to go on the fritz. Skip two
nights, and you’re a complete mess — you don’t remember what
you had for breakfast, you get cranky and angry, and bright lights
and noise hit you like a sledge hammer. If you try to stay awake,
you eventually keel over into a deep sleep or suffer more serious
harm. So whatever sleep is, it’s a big deal for the brain.
In this chapter we take a peek into the hidden world of slumber
and explain why quiet slumber is really a busy and important time,
especially for babies and toddlers. We also take an in-depth look at

those funny sleep stages, where everything from wacky dreams to
sleepwalking and sleep-talking can occur. Finally, we explain how
your tot is busy growing into the sleep pattern he’ll have for the
rest of his life.
The Poetry of a Good 
Night’s Snooze
No look at sleep is complete without talking about its poetry — and
nobody’s better at that than Shakespeare. The following sections
point to his genius on the subject.
Sleep is break time for the mind
When Shakespeare called sleep “the death of each day’s life,” he
was right on the money. Your active, waking day comes to a com-
plete and crashing halt when you call it a night. Whether you spent
your day stuck in freeway traffic or figuring out where the triangle
piece fits in the shape-sorter toy — when the lights go out, it’s over.
At this finish line of each day, a big or little person’s mind can shift
from working on the outside world’s problems to doing its own thing,
free from worries and obligations. Of course, outer and inner worlds
are connected, so dreams often reflect waking experiences. But in the
world of sleep, you can think whatever you want — any thought can
come true. And it’s a welcome break from the outside world, where
humans big and small face a less flexible reality. (Thanks to Mother
Nature, though, the brain has a little alarm that wakes you when any-
thing too exciting happens in that outside world!)
Sleep soothes the troubled soul
What about getting a rest from the mental pains of the day?
Shakespeare called sleep the “balm of hurt minds,” and again he
was right on target. Life’s a joy, but it’s also full of dashed desires.
For your tot, those frustrations can include getting a dumb break-
fast cereal instead of his favorite one, Daddy being too busy to play
ball, a rivalry with a playmate, or a broken toy. These disappoint-
ments can leave a little mind in turmoil. The solution? A good
night’s sleep.
In addition, sleep seems to do the following:
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
22

 Builds memories through brain connections so you can file
away everyday facts and figures like how to say “Mama” or
count to three. (More on this process in the sections “The
Brain’s High Heaven: Sleeping through Stages” and “Taking a
detour into Dreamland: REM.”)
 Lets you make sense of the emotional swirls that went along
with these memories. (See “Taking a detour into Dreamland:
REM” later in this chapter.)
 Helps you come to terms with disappointments and frustra-
tions and come out stronger the next day.
 Cuts you off from the troublesome world, letting you put a
personal stamp on the events of the day and see events solely
in your mind’s eye.
As you do this, you retell the story in your own way and put
setbacks in perspective. Even those hard-to-explain dreams
can prepare you for new and better approaches to your nag-
ging problems.
 Lets you use dreams to rewrite the ending of a daily story and
create new memories in the process.
Unfortunately sleep can’t accomplish these goals if you can’t get to
Sleepyland in the first place. So parents need to set the stage for
good sleep — especially when a child’s in turmoil — and get him
into the routine. (We cover this topic more in Chapters 5 and 6.)
Sleep is food for body, mind, and soul
Shakespeare also called sleep “great nature’s second course, chief
nourisher in life’s feast.” In other words, sleep is the glorious last
course of the day’s marvelous banquet.
Perhaps the most compelling proof of how sleep nourishes the
brain comes from studies of the brain when sleep is interrupted.
Studies show that in children as young as 2 years of age even a
minor disruption (like their own heavy snoring) leads to severe
problems in brain function. These problems include irritability,
aggression, emotional instability, attention deficits, and loss of
memory function and overall intelligence. When doctors fix the
snoring problem and good sleep returns, these important func-
tions return to normal.
In animal studies, a three-hour interruption of sleep sharply
reduced the ability of the hippocampus (an important center for
memory function in the brain) to make new memories. In addition,
the animals became extremely irritable. A nine-hour interruption
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance and Stages of Slumber 23

wiped out the measured memory function altogether! (See the sec-
tion on Stage 2 and REM sleep later in this chapter for the types of
memory that sleep helps create.)
It’s easy to understand why food gives a boost of energy — food is
fuel. But, studies show that sleep clearly provides energy too. The
question is: How is this possible when sleep doesn’t give the body
actual fuel? The answer appears to lie in the brain. Food may give
your body the fuel, but sleep allows your brain to use that fuel to
order your mind, memories, and moods. End result: You have the
mental energy to tackle the big job of life.
By allowing the brain to make new connections, file away precious
memories, and spin the lessons of the day into the story of one’s
life (see the bullets in the previous section), sleep helps a person to
 Emerge better-rested and more able to tackle another day in
the real world
 Be less irritable about life’s little disappointments, less sad
about the big ones
 Think more clearly after sweeping away the debris of the 
previous day.
Not surprisingly, little tykes, just like grown-ups, can go to bed
fussy or sad or exhausted and pop out of bed the next day rarin’ 
to go again. That last course in the banquet — sleep — makes 
the next day seem new, fresh, and full of opportunity.

Sleep trivia: Lions and tigers 
and bears, oh . . . zzzzz
From a survival standpoint, sleep seems like a weird idea. After all, there you are,
totally out of it for hours at a time, and anybody can whack you with a rock or steal
your stereo. So why does Mother Nature program you to do something that seems
so dangerous?
One unusual explanation stems from the old, old days when people roamed the
savannah and their biggest worry wasn’t burglars or bad people but animals. When
you think about it, sleep’s a mighty good form of camouflage because most preda-
tors spot their dinner by watching for motion, and nothing stops us from moving like
a good long snooze.
Interestingly, if you line up all the mammals according to who’s most vulnerable to
predators, they line up in the same order as who’s the most sleepy. So the more
hunted the mammal (at least historically), the more sleep it needs!

Understanding Your Internal Clock
The first and most dramatic moment of sleep is the big leap from
being awake to being asleep. If you’ve ever tried to spot the exact
moment when you go from sleeping to waking, you know it’s
impossible; one minute you’re thinking, “I need to get celery at 
the store . . .” and the next you’re out like a light.
As it turns out, that line between waking and sleeping marks a
huge chasm between two very different states of being. Consider
these three steps:
 When scientists look at brain wave patterns of a wide-awake
person, they see a whole bunch of varying waves.
 If they ask the person to meditate (or simply enter that trance
world of television-watching), these waves slow down and
become more regular.
 When the person falls asleep, the waves slow much more 
dramatically and start marching in parade-drill sync.
Keeping this sleep-wake cycle under control is a major task, so a
big chunk of the brain’s work involves managing when, how often,
and how long a person sleeps each day. And although nearly every
part of the brain pitches in to keep the sleep-wake cycle on track,
one part in particular does the heavy lifting to summon the sand-
man. Read on.
The arbiter of sleepy time
People are wired to be awake when it’s sunny and asleep when it’s
dark, thanks to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN — but we prom-
ise you won’t be tested on that!). The SCN is a small group of cells
deep in your brain’s hypothalamus, the control center for lots of
body functions like sleeping, eating, and breathing.
Of course, the SCN doesn’t manage the brain’s clock all on its own.
Input from every part of the body helps, and the pineal gland
(which makes a sleep-related hormone called melatonin) plays an
especially important role. In some animals, in fact, the pineal gland
continues to make melatonin according to the animal’s clock even
after the gland is removed!
Nevertheless, the SCN appears to be command central for clock
operations, and the coolest part is its extraordinary ability to keep
time. When your eyes tell your brain that it’s light or dark outside,
this information goes straight to the SCN. (See Chapter 4 for info
on this day/night pattern, called the circadian rhythm.)
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance and Stages of Slumber 25

One of the great properties of the SCN — and the body’s internal
clock as a whole — is its adaptability. If you’ve ever experienced
jet lag, you may wonder how good your brain is at adapting. But jet
lag actually demonstrates how solid your clock is and how quickly
it can adapt. The body’s clock resists changes (which is why that
first day in a new time zone is sheer misery), but when it has to
change, it can shift the whole body onto a new schedule in just a
day or two.
Grasping what makes 
your own clock tick
The SCN doesn’t run on batteries or plug into the wall. Instead, it
uses chemical vibes — molecules that actually vibrate on a micro-
scopic level — that tell you to open your eyes and say “Good
morning!” or hit the pillow and snore.
This clever little clock calculates your bedtime based on
 The cycle of light and dark
 The times you eat
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
26
Sleep trivia: What a piece of work is man
(and woman and child)!
The wonderful design of the human brain lets people engage in two activities that
most living things can’t — being awake and being asleep.
Little one-celled animals, which make up most life on the planet, zip around without
any minds at all, so sleep is out of the question. Plants also lack brains; they simply
react to chemical changes without switching between being awake or asleep. At
a casual glance, fish and reptiles appear to sleep, but scientists say these crea-
tures don’t have clear states of asleep and awake. (The waking state of a lizard, for
example, looks pretty much like a human’s deep sleep.)
In reality, only birds and mammals have sleeping and waking states. And most inter-
estingly, the more complex the brain (from bird brain to human brain), the more con-
scious — awake — it is. Deep sleep, even rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, goes
way back in evolution, but being wide-awake is the new concept on the planet.
This consciousness both complicates and enriches human life with infinite choices,
desires, and possibilities — and, in turn, elevates sleep from mere instinct to a pow-
erful tool for managing thoughts and memories. So sleep is a big chapter in the
amazing story of how human minds live in, craft, and create the world around them!

 Your daily routine
 Your emotions (which explains why there’s nothing like a big
scare or upset to chase away sleep).
If you don’t throw your day/night schedule out of kilter (say, by
flying cross-country), and you eat regularly, follow your usual rou-
tines, and stay on an even keel emotionally, this tiny internal clock
keeps humming away right on schedule. And each night around
bedtime, it sends out a signal that says, “Shut those eyes!” so you
can enter the very exciting world of slumber.
Each person’s internal clock is unique, of course; everything from
tiny biochemical variations to different personality traits and
lifestyles can influence whether a person’s an early riser or night
owl, and whether he likes six, eight, or ten hours of sleep each
night. These variations are just one reason why getting your tot 
to sleep on your schedule is a bit of an adventure.
Sleeping through Stages
Because sleep is mainly about the brain, the brain naturally con-
trols the most striking aspect of sleep: its stages. These stages are
a fascinating part of Slumberland, and knowing a little about them
can help you manage your infant and toddler’s sleep better. In fact,
getting a handle on sleep stages can help you to
 Know when your tot is ready for sleep scheduling (see
“Getting Used to a Sleep Pattern: The Early Days of Life” 
later in this chapter).
 Understand why your child sleeps lightly at some times 
and soundly at others.
 Know what’s going on when nightmares, sleepwalking, 
or night terrors crop up (see Chapter 7 for more on 
these issues).
Your brain can be in five different states while you’re sleeping.
Four of these states are called the stages of sleep (which tend to
flow from one to another in an orderly sequence), and one state 
is called rapid eye movement sleep (REM — see the later section
“Taking a detour into Dreamland: REM”). In the following sections,
we look at how people enter the kingdom of Sleepyland and then
cycle through its stages.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance and Stages of Slumber 27

Stage 1: On the border between
wake and sleep
When you enter Stage 1 sleep, you’re on the boundary between
waking and sleeping. These are the facts:
 It’s the shortest stage of sleep; you spend about 5 percent of
your time there.
 It’s easier to rouse you in this stage than any other, which is
why a creaking floor or a flapping curtain can snap you back
into the land of the waking.
 You can sometimes experience a very brief, strong muscle
twitch.
Sometimes it’s so powerful that you actually wake up; it often
goes hand-in-hand with a sensation of falling.
This hypnic jerk is perfectly normal for tots and adults (but
don’t yell out “hypnic jerk!” when your partner does it in bed
or you may be in trouble).
Even though you barely have one foot in the land of sleep when
you enter Stage 1, your brain’s electrical patterns are already
changing to a lower voltage and your eyes are starting to roll. 
The sleep game’s already afoot.
Stage 2: The biggest territory 
in Sleepyland
Although tots have to grow into it (see “Getting Used to a Sleep
Pattern: The Early Days of Life” later in this chapter), grownups
spend most sack time in Stage 2.
When you hit Stage 2,
 You’re not in deep sleep, but you’re much more soundly
asleep than in Stage 1.
 Your eyes don’t move any more.
 There may be some dreaming, but most dreams appear to
occur in REM sleep, not during the four sleep stages. (See 
the section on REM sleep later in this section.)
 Your brain starts to create bursts of electrical activity that
may help it move away from the hectic electrical activity of
being awake and toward the slower, more orderly rhythms of
being asleep. Each burst lasts just a few seconds, but that’s a
long time in your brain’s world.
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
28

What happens to a person during these bursts? The sleeping
person has no way of knowing because she can’t remember any-
thing from Stage 2 sleep.
But thanks to hard-working scientists — who never seem to snooze
themselves — some exciting clues about the brain’s secret world
are beginning to surface. For instance, research shows that a key
reason for sleep is to help each day’s memories settle into images
that can last a lifetime. (See the section “Sleep is food for body,
mind, and soul,” earlier in this chapter for more on how sleep
affects memory.)
In addition, scientists believe different types of memories get 
cast in stone in different stages of sleep. Stage 2 sleep seems 
to sort out and preserve facts, figures, and other dry bits of 
information — like 2 + 2 = 4 and the capital of Montana (these 
are declarative memories). In fact, the more sleep spindles (a 
type of electrical burst peculiar to Stage 2 sleep) that your brain
creates at night, the better you can remember the facts from the
day before; the more you can learn in the day, the more spindles 
you can generate at night! So if you can remember the capital of
Montana, thank your Stage 2 sleep. (It’s Helena — you can put 
that on your spindle!)
Stage 3: Ahh, deep sleep
When you head into Stage 3, you’re entering the world of deep
sleep — a very different place from Stages 1 and 2 (light sleep) and
from REM — the sleep of dreams, which we discuss later in “Taking
a detour into Dreamland: REM”). In Stage 3, those funny bursts of
electrical energy from Stage 2 disappear, replaced by a very slow
wave pattern called the delta wave.
Just as Stage 2 sleep is a bridge to Stage 3, Stage 3 is a staircase —
to Stage 4, the basement of the sleep cellar. The further your tot
climbs down these steps, the more soundly he sleeps. (But that
sound sleep can only take place after these stages fully develop,
which explains your tot’s deeper, uninterrupted sleep as he gets
older. See “Getting Used to a Sleep Pattern: The Early Days of Life,”
later in this chapter, for more info.)
Deep sleep, which kicks in at Stage 3 and accounts for roughly 
one-quarter of total sleep time, is one of life’s greatest mysteries. 
It hides more secrets than even the deepest seas because no one
ever returns from deep sleep with any memory of the experience.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance and Stages of Slumber 29

When you reach this stage,
 You have a pretty hard time climbing back to the waking world.
 People can’t easily rouse you.
 You’re likely to be a bit dazed and confused if you do wake up.
Stage 4: The mystery realm
In Stage 4, the deepest of deep sleep, those slow delta brainwaves
that enter the picture in Stage 3 now dominate the brain’s activity.
(That’s why sleep specialists call Stages 3 and 4 slow wave sleep.)
Stages 3 and 4 are very much alike, but the really rock-solid deep
sleep occurs in Stage 4. Many of the most interesting events in
deep sleep (night terrors, bed-wetting, sleep-talking and walking)
also occur in Stage 4 sleep.
As babies get older, even in toddlerhood, they spend lots of time in
Stage 4 sleep in the first part of the night and less and less as the
morning grows near. As Stage 4 sleep gets shorter in each sleep
cycle, REM sleep (see the next section) gets longer. This expanding
REM sleep may shorten the Stage 4 phase.
Because Stage 4 is the deepest level of sleep, you may suspect that
not much happens. However, research shows that, in fact, a whole
lot’s going on. Here’s the evidence:
 People grow — especially at night!
The human body makes a substance called growth hormone,
which — you guessed it — stimulates and controls growth. The
pituitary gland cranks more of this hormone out at night than
in the daytime, and it really revs up in Stage 3 or Stage 4 sleep.
 People are moved to, well, move.
A visible clue that something’s going on in deep sleep is sleep
arousal. These arousals are
• An odd mixture of some waking brain functions and very
deep sleep. (We delve into these events in Chapter 7 but
bring them up here because they happen in the deepest
depths of Stage 4 slumber.)
• Generally very short — just long enough to roll over in
bed (important so you don’t get bedsores) without
waking up or even leaving deep sleep.
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
30

• Sometimes alarming. Occasionally, sleep arousals last
much longer than a simple rollover, and kids can wet the
bed, sleepwalk, or experience night terrors (see Chapter
7 for details).
Detouring into Dreamland: REM
All night long, a person cycles through the stages of sleep, sliding
from Stage 1 to 2 to 3, all the way down to Stage 4, and then climb-
ing way up from 4 to 3 to 2 to start all over again (see Figure 2-1).
For adults this cycle happens four or five times a night, with each
cycle taking about 1 1⁄2 hours. (We talk about tots and their cycle
that eventually relaxes into the adult REM in “Getting Used to a
Sleep Pattern: The Early Days of Life” later in this chapter.)
At regular intervals during this cycle, however, a person can jump
off the path and into the wild overgrowth of REM sleep, the state in
which most dreams occur. During the first few hours of sleep, the
detour into REM sleep is brief, but toward morning the dreamer
spends much more time exploring this strange land. At the end of
each REM state, after you’re back in Stage 2, you choose whether
to go toward deeper sleep or to wake up.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance and Stages of Slumber 31
The reasoning for REM: Some speculations
One theory about REM sleep is that it helps people manage desire. According to
this idea, humans store up frustrations and unmet desires each day; at night all of
those frustrated dreams come true in the realm of REM. This theory suggests that
people couldn’t live without dreams and still keep their sanity because those desires
would pile up and become overwhelming.
Although people store facts during Stage 2 sleep, they don’t need to create a whole
scene to remember that 12 + 36 = 48! In contrast, memories about a special time or
place — like the excitement of a birthday party or the highlights of a road trip —
seem to enter the memory only in REM sleep. So another theory about REM sleep
is that it etches the more interesting memories involving emotions or events in a
person’s memory so he can find them later. People seem to need a narrative to
understand and remember their important emotional memories; dreams are the
stage that allows them to write these plays.
These dreams, then, help a person understand, explain, and remember these emo-
tional kinds of information — like why you love one special person or can’t stand to
be in the same room with an archenemy!

We know that REM sleep is a prime time for dreaming because
sleepers who awaken when REM patterns occur on a monitor often
report vivid dreams. Dreamlike episodes do occur at other times,
but they appear to be more business-like — that is, brief and
rational. REM dreams, in contrast, are typically a crazy quilt of
illogical events and wild emotions.
Although REM sleep usually starts only in Stage 2 sleep, it’s very
different from all four regular stages of sleep in four ways:
 REM is the wild land where the most interesting dreams
occur. It’s where you’re most likely to encounter dragons,
flying cars, or your first-grade teacher doing the hula.
 REM looks different. You can tell when people are in REM
sleep because their eyes dart about furiously. (Strangely, the
eyes move about more frantically during this dream phase
than they do when people are wide awake!)
 REM sleep disconnects the body. When REM sleep begins, 
the brainstem suddenly cuts off communication between your
brain and your spinal cord, leaving the muscles of your body
(except for the ones you need to stay alive) unconnected to
the brain. It’s exactly like being paralyzed, but you snap out 
of it as soon as REM sleep ends. (Babies, however, don’t have
this shut-off switch yet, so they move during REM sleep.)
 REM is a wild brain-wave ride. When REM sleep starts, the
slow waves of brain electrical activity in sleep suddenly burst
into the irregular, unpredictable, more rapid, more energetic
patterns seen during waking. And that’s not all; your heart
rate, breathing, and body temperature all start acting like
you’re awake. A male’s penis can become erect, and a female’s
clitoris can become engorged. These events are very rare
during other stages of sleep.
Why do babies need so much REM sleep? A look at the animal king-
dom offers a clue. Platypus babies are some of the most immature 
of nature’s newborns, and they spend almost all their time in REM
sleep. Dolphin babies, on the other hand, arrive on the scene ready
to swim, eat, and do lots of other grownup stuff — and they spend
close to zero time in REM sleep. This hints that REM sleep plays a big
role in mental development, including exercising a child’s brain when
she’s too immature to get lots of stimulation from the outside world.
But why, then, do adults spend so much time in REM sleep? Think
about the range of thoughts, wishes, and ambitions humans have
and the scope of human imagination to invent new technologies,
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance and Stages of Slumber 33

create music and books, and establish complex relationships.
Humans may grow up, but the mind is never done dreaming and
trying to make those dreams come true.
Getting Used to a Sleep Pattern:
The Early Days of Life
The different stages of sleep occur in kids just as they do in
grownups, but tots need to grow into a mature sleep pattern. 
Sleep, just like walking and talking, develops over time.
This section covers how sleep begins and evolves from Day 1 in
the womb up through the toddler years.
Snoozing before birth
The fertilized egg doesn’t know beans about being awake or asleep
because it doesn’t have a brain yet. Even when an unborn baby
starts moving (at about 10 weeks of pregnancy), he shows no signs
of being awake or asleep.
However, between Week 20 and Week 28, your unborn baby wakes
up — and as a result, he also starts to sleep. (Ultrasounds of
fetuses as well as visual observations of very premature babies
confirm this.) At this point, your baby snoozes about half the day
in snatches of sleep lasting minutes to hours and often doesn’t
breathe when he’s dozing. (Note: When he’s awake, a baby whose
lungs are developed breathes amniotic fluid in and out.)
At this point, your baby even has two kinds of sleep: quiet and
active. Eventually, his quiet sleep turns into the four stages of sleep
we outline earlier in this chapter, and his active sleep becomes
REM sleep.
Although grownups (and toddlers, as we discuss later) spend about
25 percent of their time in REM sleep, unborn babies at Week 30
spend a whopping 90 percent of their time in the active sleep that
later turns into REM. We have no idea what their little brains are
doing during these times — but it certainly would be fun to know!
Sleeping after birth
When she first arrives, your sweetie spends an average of 16 to 17
hours a day sleeping — and still manages to work in six to eight
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
34

feedings a day! In fact, many newborns wake up just long enough
for a meal and then conk right out again. Your cherub’s immature
sleep patterns explain why she can fascinate you one hour with
her wiggling and grimacing and alarm you the next by being too
zonked to wake up for a meal.
Newborn babies spend half of their slumber in active sleep, and
they’re quite a sight: Eyes roll and wink, faces grimace, mouths
suck, hands and arms quiver, and little limbs stretch and wave
about. Note: Although grownups are essentially paralyzed from 
the neck down during their equivalent of active sleep (refer back 
to “Taking a detour into Dreamland: REM” for more on this), babies
don’t have this disconnect switch yet.
During quiet sleep, newborns simply lie there looking like angels.
Quiet sleep is really quiet because a baby’s brain isn’t creating the
type of electrical activity that yours does when you’re sleeping
(check back to “Stage 2: The biggest territory in Sleepyland”).
Many people wonder why newborn babies sleep so much. The
answer is that these little gumdrops just don’t know how to be
fully asleep or awake — their mature sleep stages and wakefulness
are the last brain states to fully develop. So babies spend much of
their time in the more primitive stages of active and quiet sleep.
But as the early weeks and months pass by, babies slowly but
surely become more awake and alert. (See our sidebar “Sleep
Trivia: What a Piece of Work is Man (and woman and child)” for
related info.)
Establishing mature sleep cycles
As she grows, your tot’s sleep patterns also develop. Here’s how
they change:
 The electricity starts a-churning. When your baby’s about 4
weeks old, she starts experiencing the electrical bursts during
sleep that will become a mature Stage 2 of sleep when she’s 
18 to 24 months old (see “Stage 2: The biggest territory in
Sleepyland”). When she’s about 4 months old, this electrical
activity becomes more regular, putting the pieces in place for
all-night sleeping. By the time she’s 6 months old, the electrical
activity is helping her brain develop the slower, more organ-
ized patterns that bring her closer to a solid night’s sleep.
 REM sleep grows up. By 4 months, your baby’s active sleep
looks much more like grown-up REM sleep and consumes 40
percent of her total sleep time. (Remember that all fetal sleep
begins as active sleep; it evolves in time into REM sleep, where
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance and Stages of Slumber 35

most dreams occur.) By 6 months of age, the percentage drops
to 30, and by 3 years of age, it levels off (with minor blips) to
about 20 percent, where it remains for the rest of her life.
 Deep sleep enters the picture. The deep-sleep brainwave pat-
terns of Stages 3 and 4 are in full swing by 6 to 8 months of
age. As we note earlier, the electrical activity of brain waves is
at its slowest and the waves are most synchronized in these
stages; the person is also in deepest sleep and very hard to
awaken. During Stage 4 in particular, all deep sleep events —
sleep-talking, bed-wetting, and night terrors — occur. (See
Chapter 7 for more on this.)
 Cycling starts. Newborns cycle through their active and quiet
sleep states in 30 to 70 minutes.
By 3 months of age, she’ll cycle every 75 minutes or so.
When your little snuggle-bunny hits the 4-month mark, the
beginnings of a more grownup sleep cycle emerge.
She’ll need another four or five years to reach the 90-minute
cycles of a grownup.
Getting in step with nature’s rhythm
About the time that sleep stages and REM sleep begin to mature 
(4 weeks to 4 months of age), your sweetie’s body is preparing to
make a major shift in her sleeping pattern:
 She starts falling into a sunrise/sunset cycle by about 6 weeks
of age. (More on this in Chapter 4.)
 Her sleep stages start to repeat and she may start dozing four
to five hours straight.
 Her need for food drops a bit, allowing her to skip one or two
nighttime feedings — yes!
With a little luck and lots of help from the sleep strategies we
describe in later chapters, you can stretch these periods to 6
to 8 hours, and then — keep your fingers crossed — maybe
even to 12 hours of unbroken nighttime sleep. Hallelujah!
Of all 2-month-old babies in the United States, 44 percent sleep all
night and stay up all day, except for napping.
Those naps, too, fall by the wayside over time:
 At 2 months, babies typically nap one to four times a day
 By the time they’re 1 year old, they’re down to one or two
naps a day.
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
36

 Between the ages of 3 and 5 years, the child skips those little
rest stops altogether.
In short, your tyke sleeps less and less as time goes by — but you
sleep more and more because the two of you are finally on the
same wavelength. When that happens, you can both happily cycle
through the world of Sleepyland together.
Knowing How Much Your 
Wee One May Sleep
If we could, we’d put the next paragraph in big red letters, 
surrounded by flashing lights. (You’ll just have to use your 
imagination!)
Here’s our very important message: We can tell you the average
amount of time that babies and toddlers sleep, but we can’t tell
you what’s normal — there’s no such thing as normal amounts of
sleep. So don’t fret if your child sleeps a few hours more or less
each night than the averages we talk about here; if he’s happy and
healthy, that amount is perfectly fine!
With that caution in mind, we provide a chart and figure (see Table
2-1 and Figure 2-2) showing the average number of sack-time hours
(both daytime and nighttime) for babies and toddlers.

Chapter 3
Personality: A Big Piece 
of the Puzzle
In This Chapter
 What is personality?
 How do children’s personalities affect their sleep?
 Can your personality and your baby’s get along at bedtime?
 What role does parenting style play in baby’s sleep?
 Do you know your style of parenting?
A
long with ten toes and ten fingers, each baby comes into the
world with a personality that’s all his own. One baby nurses
with vigor, and another needs to be prodded and prompted. One
baby barely moves an inch in the crib; another wiggles into the
corner and gets stuck. One is super-sensitive to noise, but another
can sleep through a Terminator marathon without stirring.
So what gives? To find out more about personality, you need to
revisit that old debate about nature-or-nurture, which we take 
you through in the first section. We also offer lots of advice in this
chapter that may seem a little overwhelming at this point. Getting
your tot’s personality, your own personality, and your parenting
style to mesh smoothly can seem like a mighty big task — and at
first, it will be.
But remember those last days before your baby’s arrival, when you
wondered how on earth you’d handle the huge job of becoming a
parent? It probably seemed overwhelming — which is why so
many soon-to-be parents get the urge to say, “Wait, I changed my
mind!” Yet in no time, you got the hang of bottles, diapers, and
burping. In fact, you probably started handing out advice to new
parents yourself.
Understanding personalities is just like that: If you try to figure out
what makes your baby tick and recognize how your own personal-
ity and parenting style fit in, you quickly find ways to help your

new family live in harmony. Your house becomes calmer, your bed-
time routines are vastly smoother, and you spend much less time
asking that familiar question, “Why is he doing that?”
Understanding the Role 
of Personality in Sleep
Experts used to think of babies as blank slates, waiting for life’s
ups and downs to write their personalities. Now, however, science
has shown that genes play a big role in whether your tot is a shy
violet, a comedian, an adventurer, or a quiet and contemplative
type. The importance of genes helps explain why two kids raised 
in the same household, by the same rules, often have completely
different personalities (something that’s even true for twins!).
But, back up. What does personality actually mean? The simple 
version is that each person has a different pattern for reacting to
the world around her — her own style of thinking, behaving, and
feeling. The sum of those styles is her personality.
You’re probably starting to spot clues about your own tot’s person-
ality already, even if she’s still a baby. Does she lie in her crib think-
ing deep thoughts when she first awakes, or does she holler to be
picked up instantly? Does she sit happily in the restaurant high
chair gumming her key ring or flirt outrageously with every person
who passes by? As time goes by, those small signs blossom into
full flower, and you start to understand your one-of-a-kind kid.
Personality affects both daytime and nighttime, and it plays a 
big part in how easily your baby gets to sleep at night. But if you
understand your little individualist and where she’s coming from,
you can more easily base your decisions on what’s best for her —
and in this case, one size does not fit all! When you combine the
info in Chapter 1 about your baby’s wants and needs with info in
this chapter about her personality, you’re fully prepared for the
bedtime battles ahead.
Homing In on Your Baby’s
Personality Type
Before you get far into this book, you need to know that personal-
ity traits, even those of your freshly baked bun, are largely hard-
wired by Mother Nature. Your child’s personality will play a big
role in how he reacts to other people, how he tackles his world,
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
40

and even how he sleeps. And no, you can’t do a whole lot to
change his personality — only his outward behavior.
Luckily, you do have a big say in how your child manages his per-
sonality as he grows — one of life’s greatest opportunities and
challenges. And you can start right now by discovering how to
factor your tot’s personality into the bedtime equation.
In this section, we look at four different types of tykes — active,
quiet, sensitive, and mellow — and show how each type typically
reacts at bedtime. In the process, we offer tips to help you tailor
sleep strategies (we explain these strategies in detail in Chapters 4
through 8) to suit your angel’s personality type.
The active child
If your sweetie’s a perpetual motion machine, you probably had a
clue — in the form of constant kicking — even before she arrived!
Your active baby came into the world squirming and squawking,
and she can get so excited about feeding that she has a hard time
calming down enough to nurse or take a bottle. She may gulp her
food or eat in short spurts because she can’t stay still for long peri-
ods of time. Her motto is, “I move, therefore I am.”
Active tots exhaust themselves in the daytime and often sleep
soundly — but not for long. A very active baby often awakens with
a start and begins crying heartily as soon as she opens her eyes.
Naps are short and hard to come by if your angel is the active type,
and she’s likely to drop them altogether before she hits the one-
year mark. Also, don’t be surprised if she doesn’t melt into your
arms when you try to cuddle — she maybe more interested in
trying to wiggle away so she can continue her explorations.
Parents of active kids typically have two reactions. One is pride:
“Wow, look at her go!” The other is exhaustion: “You get her down
from the bookcase. I’ve had it.” Amazingly, these tots don’t slow
down as the evening progresses. Instead, the closer to bedtime,
the more wide-awake they become.
A tot who’s stuck in hyper-drive often needs more help snuggling
down and conking out than her calmer peers. If you’re the parent
of a kid who’s set permanently to On, these tips can help:
 Think calm. As you read through the chapters that follow,
zero in on the calming strategies we describe (for instance,
nix evening roughhousing; instead use calming music to
soothe your savage beast). You need these strategies to an
even greater degree than other parents do.
Chapter 3: Personality: A Big Piece of the Puzzle 41

 Talk — even if your tot doesn’t! Little whirlwinds are so busy
honing their motor skills that they sometimes put their lan-
guage skills on hold. As a result, parents of non-stop kids tend
to forego words and instead rely on actions to pave the path
to Sleepyland. But your sweetie understands much more than
she lets on, so give her lots of verbal hints that it’s time to
quiet down.
 Try swaddling. One trick that can work well for an active
child, at least during the first few months of infancy, is to 
wrap her tightly in a blanket, a technique called swaddling.
(Techniques for swaddling along with illustrations are in
Chapter 12.) Note: Although swaddling calms some active
tots, it only makes others angry. So if it helps, use it; if it 
doesn’t help, stop.
The quiet or cautious child
Quiet children are the easy babies, content to watch the world
from the safety of Mommy’s or Daddy’s arms. As they grow up,
however, they create a different set of worries.
Quiet babies often sleep like rocks and occasionally scare their par-
ents when they need to be roused for a meal. As they grow, they can
lag a bit in gross motor skills (big movements), but they frequently
have well-developed fine motor skills (small and precise movements
like picking up a piece of cereal). Their forte, however, is language,
and they often talk circles around their play-group peers.
 Keep life predictable. Even more than other babies, these
little ones need a routine. They’re very sensitive to changes; a
new caregiver or even a new night light may cause fretting. As
you read through the sleep strategies in upcoming chapters,
focus on creating and following a very structured routine. Also,
when changes occur, be sure to talk your tot through them.
 Think motion. If your quiet baby loves to just sit for long peri-
ods of time, take a few minutes each day to challenge him
physically. If he thinks that tummy time is torture time, make
it as fun as possible (for instance, offer enticing toys) so he’s
more eager to move about. Give him a good workout at least
once a day; you’ll tire him out and make sleep a sweet release.
 Watch for early mental milestones. The quiet or cautious
tyke often hits the separation anxiety stage early. (See
Chapter 6 for an explanation of this stage.) If your quiet little
mouse clings to you when you’re in a crowd — even if it’s a
crowd of friends or relatives — be sensitive to his needs.
Don’t pass him around like a plate of tasty hors d’oeuvres, or
he’s likely to be too stressed to sleep.
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
42

 If your baby is premature or isn’t gaining weight, you may
need to do the unthinkable: Wake him up in the middle of
the night for a feeding even if he’s willing to sleep through.
Your health care provider can help you decide when to let
sleeping babies lie. (See Chapter 12 for a discussion of prema-
ture infants.)
The child with sensory sensitivity
Do you cut the tags off every garment you own, get sick at the
smell of some household cleaners, or find it impossible to concen-
trate at a party because of the background noise? Almost all of us
are touchy about some sounds, aromas, textures, tastes, or types
of lighting, and that’s true of kids as well.
Adults try to avoid the situations that make them uncomfortable,
but tots don’t have that luxury. Your baby can’t say, “Get this shirt
off me — it scratches like crazy,” or “The vacuum noise is hurting
my head.” So she does the next-best thing — she cries.
Some babies do a whole lot of crying because they’re extra-
sensitive to sensory input —the info from the outside world that
comes through our eyes, ears, mouth, nose, skin, and internal
motion and gravity detectors.
For the hypersensitive tot, the world is just too much of a good
thing. Even a trip to the playground can bring on sensory overload
with accompanying tears and tantrums. Suspect sensory issues if
your child has any of these challenges:
 Has trouble with changes. Transitions — like leaving a fun
time in the park — are hard for many kids, but the sensitive
child may balk at any change of venue (for instance, moving
from indoors to outdoors or from the car to the store).
Shifting gears may prompt an infuriating slowdown or a 
complete meltdown.
 Fusses a lot at her clothes and complains about tags or seams.
 Reacts strongly to sights, sounds, smells, or textures that
don’t bother other kids her age (for instance, she often covers
her ears when she hears music or the television or refuses to
touch finger paints).
 Doesn’t like being touched.
 Goes bonkers more easily than other tots (for instance, at
every trip to the mall).
Chapter 3: Personality: A Big Piece of the Puzzle 43

Other clues that can point to sensory issues (although they also
pop up in other personality types) include a strong startle reaction
and trouble calming down after an upsetting or exciting event.
The good news is that when you spot clues that your child is sen-
sory sensitive, you can change her little world in ways that make
her happier — and sleepier at bedtime. And that means more
peace and quiet for you — a good thing even for a parent who’s 
not sensitive to noise!
Here are a few adjustments that can make a big difference:
 Lower the volume. We talk in Chapters 5 and 15 about keep-
ing your home quiet at bedtime. That advice goes triple for
the touchy tot because a dropped pan or the laugh track 
from a television show can set off an hour-long crying jag. If
necessary, supplement the tips in the other chapters with two
simple but effective ideas: Buy a CD of white noise to block
out household sounds and install a set of blackout curtains in
your little snuggle-bunny’s room.
 Stay away from scents. The fragrances in detergents, soaps,
and cleaning products can set a hypersensitive poppet’s teeth
on edge. Try fragrance-free products to see whether they
make a difference.
 Test the temp. Your baby may need to be a little cooler or
warmer than most people in order to sleep well. Try adjusting
the thermostat — but be careful not to make a young baby’s
room too hot. Over-heating is a possible risk for sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS; see Chapter 4).
 Think inside the bag. Tags, collars, and jammie feet can drive
a sensory-sensitive tot wild. Consider using bag-style pajamas
instead.
 Rub away the tension. Avoid rough-and-tumble play right
before lights-out time, and substitute a massage. Apply firm
pressure as you massage because sensory-sensitive kids can
find a light touch almost maddening. As your child reaches the
preschool years, she may love a firm back rub before bedtime.
In some cases, signs that suggest sensory issues are so powerful or
complex that do-it-yourself approaches aren’t enough. If that’s the
case with your child, be sure to meet with your pediatrician and
establish a plan to determine why your child is having so much
trouble. When you know the nature of the difficulty, you and your
pediatrician can more easily create an approach that helps your
sweetie cope successfully.

44

The mellow child
Mellow babies are a joy both day and (usually) night. They nurse
or take their bottles with no fuss. They hit milestones so perfectly
that parents wonder whether they’re sneaking peeks at the baby
books. (“Let’s see, today I mastered peek-a-boo, so I’ll shoot for
gumming finger foods tomorrow.”) And early on, some of these
babies often just start sleeping through the night — without even 
a hint of encouragement from Mom or Dad.
However, saying “Goodnight” may turn out to be the only step
some of these mellow children don’t do by the book. If your nor-
mally tranquil tot throws you a curve ball at sunset, it’s perplexing
and easy to assume something’s wrong. But the good news is that
laid-back personalities are more likely to fall into an acceptable
routine and offer less resistance than feistier kids.
Even if your mellow lad or lass is a great sleeper, we have some
words of wisdom: Enjoy it while it lasts! The first few years of a
child’s life are like the stock market — lots of ups and downs —
and even a child with a sunny disposition experiences a few set-
backs now and then. So if a life change (like divorce or a move to a
new house) throws your placid little pumpkin into a tizzy, check
out Chapter 14 for advice. If a cold or flu bug turns your love-bug’s
happy mood to a sour one, see Chapter 13. Otherwise, savor the
peace and quiet . . . and consider loaning this book to the parents
of the screaming tot next door.
Meshing Your Personality Type
with Your Wee One’s
Just like your baby, you’re one-of-a-kind. You have your own way of
acting and your own likes and dislikes. Maybe your idea of heaven
is cuddling on the couch with a good book and a cup of chai tea.
Maybe it’s hosting a dinner party for 50 or climbing Mount Everest.
You may love jazz, heavy metal, or Mozart.
And that’s just you. If you have a partner, this means another
unique grownup lives in your house — two adult personalities that
need to mesh with your baby’s personality. Maybe you luck out
and you’re all on the same wavelength. (You probably know fami-
lies where everyone’s quiet and bookish and others where Mom,
Dad, and all the kids love sports and tailgate parties.) If not, your
child can benefit greatly from your two different perspectives on
life, and parents with different personalities often complement
Chapter 3: Personality: A Big Piece of the Puzzle 45

each other well. For instance, maybe Dad’s a quiet night owl who
loves the 2 a.m. feeding, and Mom’s a social butterfly who can’t
wait for morning play-group.
But even if you and your partner have your personality duet down
pat, you still need to harmonize with that little person in the crib.
In the following sections, we look at some examples of the issues
that can arise when Mommy or Daddy is a very different type of
person than Junior.
Laid-back parent and 
raring-to-go baby
Are you a relaxed and quiet type who’s raising an active baby? If
so, the wild child bouncing off your walls from morn to night may
seem like a total mystery to you. You probably interpret your
baby’s vigorous crying and her resistance to the usual calming
measures as a sign that you’re flunking Parenting 101. In reality,
however, you only need one bit of parenting advice: Relax!
When your sweetie wakes up screaming, do you rush in to save her
from her obvious distress? If you’re the type who displays emotions
only with really important issues, you can easily misinterpret your
drama queen’s hysterics for the real deal. The result? Many months
after your baby is ready to sleep on her own, you’re still dashing
into her room like an Olympic sprinter each time she shrieks.
The key is to recognize that your little dumpling isn’t in distress 
at all. She just wakes up ready to rock ‘n’ roll — even at 2 in the
morning — and she knows that screaming like an actress in a
budget horror flick brings you running pronto.
In Chapter 5, we describe how to break this parent-on-demand 
pattern — a lesson that’s especially important for quiet parents 
of tornado tots. As you follow our guidelines, remember these 
two clear possibilities:
 Your active tot will squawk louder and longer than babies
with calmer temperaments, so steel your nerves.
 Because you treasure calm and quiet, you’re more sensitive to
those screams than other parents may be.
By recognizing these personality traits in yourself and your baby,
you can more easily keep your sleep strategies on track and resist
the urge to give in. What’s more, your response teaches your busy
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
46

bee very early in life that she can’t always take advantage of your
powerful desire for peace and quiet, and that’s a win-win!
Red-hot parent and thoughtful tot
If you’re the life of the party and make friends easily, winding up
with a tyke who inches his way cautiously through the world is a
real surprise. We meet many outgoing parents who mistake their
sweeties’ quiet, thoughtful natures for a sign of serious emotional
problems. In reality, though, the only problem these families have
is a major personality mismatch.
A hale-and-hearty parent who’s raising a quiet and thoughtful tot
can err on the side of over-attentiveness. So the best bet with a
contemplative tot is to let him explore the world and figure it out
in his own time and his own way. Step back, be patient, and don’t
force the issue.
The same is true about sleep. You may feel the urge to run to your
tyke when he cries because he’s so quiet other times. You think,
“He must really need me if he’s making so much noise.” But the
truth is that he simply needs a chance to figure out sleep time (just
like day time) on his own.
Sensible parent and sensory-
sensitive child
Are you the kind of person who doesn’t care whether you’re wear-
ing cotton or nylon, who boogies to loud radio music when you
dust, and couldn’t care less about a dripping faucet? So how’d 
you wind up with a kid who screams if the lights are too bright, 
the music’s too loud, or the underwear label is scratchy?
Because you’re not hypersensitive to your own senses, you may
think your tot’s just spoiled when she overreacts to the world
around her. But she’s not! Many children enter the world not-quite-
ready for its exciting sights, sounds, smells, and textures, and they
need time to begin to cope.
The biggest challenge for these tots is to let Mommy or Daddy
know that they’re not faking it — so listen to your baby’s cues and
then make adjustments where you can (we cover the specifics in
“The child with sensory sensitivity” earlier in this chapter).
Chapter 3: Personality: A Big Piece of the Puzzle 47

The anxious parent and 
the tranquil tot
As we mention earlier, you’ve hit the jackpot if your tot is 
mellow and easygoing. But there’s a hitch: If you’re a worrier 
by nature — and especially if Little Mister Mellow is your first 
child — you may have trouble recognizing that your sweetie’s
doing just fine.
If you fuss, fret, and worry too much about your good-natured 
little guy, you can actually create problems where none exist 
(especially at bedtime!). So keep your cool. If your pediatrician
says your child’s right on track, try not to complicate your life —
or your baby’s — by being a Nervous Nellie. And if you can’t take
the doctor’s word for it, talk with your partner or friends or rela-
tives. You probably can’t bother your laidback tot by worrying
excessively, but you can drive yourself or your partner nuts.

Stories from the crib: The high-
maintenance sister
Nita had two daughters, Ruchira (age 4) and Sari (age 2), and she saw differences
in their behavior from the moment Sari arrived on the scene. Sari was fussier,
needed to be carried more, and never fell into a regular sleep pattern. Just when
Nita thought she had a schedule down, Sari changed the rules.
When Ruchira reached the toddler years, Nita could take her to a family party and
park her in her stroller for a quick nap. Sari, on the other hand, sobbed piteously if
Nita tried this trick. When they came home, she made life miserable for everyone
the rest of the day and night. Nita quickly realized that she needed to either forego
social events or leave Sari home with a sitter. Eventually, Nita realized that she
needed to parent Ruchira and Sari differently.
Nita also found out the hard way that she had to make other changes to keep Sari
calm. When dressing Sari brought on tears, Nita switched to 100 percent cotton
clothing and started using scent-free detergents. She kept the house extra-quiet at
night and watched Sari closely in noisy settings to see whether she needed a break.
Over time, Sari grew less tense in the day; tuck-in time became much more relaxed
for everyone.
As Nita told her friends, Ruchira was like polyester — go anywhere and never get
crumpled. But Sari was like fine linen — the smallest disruption caused her to crinkle!

The Final Piece of the Puzzle: 
Your Parenting Style
When we say style, we’re not talking about whether you wear your
old sweats or a pair of Armani jeans when you take your sweetie to
the playground. In parenting, style refers to your typical response
to your sweetie’s actions. Your parenting style affects how you
approach daytime discipline, nighttime sleep issues, and every-
thing in between.
In the previous sections, we show how parents’ and kids’ personal-
ities can be out of sync. Just the awareness that differences can
exist often gives parents the insight and the confidence to make
the changes that promote positive, peaceful solutions. The same is
true for parenting style: When you spot patterns in your reactions
to your child’s behaviors, you can replace knee-jerk responses with
well-designed actions that promote the behavior you want to see.
Your parenting style stems largely from these sources:
 Your own personality: For instance, if you’re quiet by nature,
you may give in to your tyke’s demands just to restore calm. 
If you don’t mind racket, on the other hand, you may just let
her squawk.
 The way your parents raised you: Do you want to follow in
their footsteps or avoid their mistakes? Your answer plays a
big role in your reactions to tears, tantrums, and bedtime
issues.
 The tips you pick up: The knowledge you gain from other par-
ents, parenting classes, and books can give you insights into
good parenting and steer you away from mistakes.
 The feedback loop: Your little darling’s responses to you
affect how you respond to her. In fact, babies train their 
parents as much as parents train their babies!
All of these ingredients blend to create your own recipe for 
parenting.
Examining the three main styles
Typically, your style falls into one of three broad categories: permis-
sive, authoritarian, and authoritative. Of course, you may act one
way on Tuesday and a different way on Thursday — but over time
you establish a pattern for discipline and other parenting issues.
Chapter 3: Personality: A Big Piece of the Puzzle 49

Permissive parents
Permissive parents — their motto is All you need is love — avoid
punishing their tot or inhibiting his impulses, desires, and actions.
As their sweetie grows up, these parents make few demands
regarding chores or house rules. They see themselves more as
resources than role models and tend to let their child regulate his
own activities as much as possible.
Permissive parents are willing to reason with their kids or even
manipulate them, but they draw the line at using parent power to
achieve a goal like sleeping through the night.
Authoritarian parents
Authoritarian parents — the drill sergeants of the parenting world —
live by a firm set of rules; they value obedience, manners, and a ship-
shape house. A drill-sergeant parent’s home has strict schedules, a
challenging list of weekly chore assignments, and little or no discus-
sion about what Junior wants to eat, wear, or do over the weekend.
A drill sergeant’s house has no flexibility and little concern for 
how a tot’s feelings may affect his behavior. If he asks why he
needs to eat spinach or wear a jacket, the only explanation he 
gets is, “Because I say so.” And if he looks for a shoulder to cry 
on, he’s likely to get a lecture instead.
Authoritative parents
Authoritative parents — gentle bosses — offer guidance and direc-
tion while still valuing their little cubs’ thoughts and wishes. These
parents welcome discussion and they love sharing ideas with their
tots, but they take a firm stand when it’s time to resolve a conflict.
The child of a gentle boss may snooze in bed with Mom and Dad
during a thunderstorm or get to stay up a half hour later on a holi-
day. However, he doesn’t sass a neighbor, throw a hissy fit in the
toy store, or wake Mom or Dad up six times a night on a whim.
His gentle bosses know when a firm rein is needed and when they
can relax the rules. They enjoy his quirks and funny ways, but they
also look toward the future and understand that the better he
behaves, the better he’ll do in life.
Recognizing how parenting 
styles affect tots’ sleep
A famous study by Diana Baumrind, whose research on parenting
styles published in 1966 and revisited in 1991 is a cornerstone of
child development, looked at kids raised with different parenting
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
50

styles. Just about all the kids grew up to be fine, but the children of
permissive or drill-sergeant parents did have some specific issues
that didn’t affect kids of gentle-boss parents. Here are some exam-
ples from her research following these kids through adulthood:
 Kids of permissive parents had trouble regulating their emo-
tions and tended to talk back or act defiantly when their
wishes weren’t met. In addition, they didn’t persist as much
as other people when they faced a difficult task. Why? Kids
who don’t get a gentle nudge to attempt age-appropriate tasks
can get the message that they’re not capable. This assump-
tion discourages them from plugging away until they solve a
problem.
 Kids with drill-sergeant parents, on the other hand, typically
did well in school and didn’t talk back or have trouble shar-
ing. But more than other kids, they tended to be anxious and
unhappy as they grew up. And just like the kids of permissive
parents, they had trouble solving problems on their own.
Because Mom or Dad always told them what to do, they didn’t
know how to cope without that familial compass.
And how about the kids with the gentle-boss parents? These kids
typically grew up happy, able to get along well with other people,
and capable of solving problems without needing their parents to
either bail them out or impose a solution.
What do all these characteristics have to do with sleep? A great
deal, as it turns out! Here’s why:
 Bedtime is decision time. At tuck-in time or during a middle-
of-the-night waking, your angel needs to decide: Do I go to
sleep or stay awake? The parents who acknowledge that
saying “Nighty-night” is hard but still establish firm and rea-
sonable expectations set the stage for a good night’s sleep
and help Junior become an effective problem solver later.
 Stress equals sleeplessness. The anxiety of kids raised by my-
way-or-the-highway parents can set in early. These tots may
be so worried about their parents’ reactions that they have
trouble falling and staying asleep, which keeps them from
being wide-eyed and ready for daytime activities.
 Emotional issues sabotage sleep. Kids raised by permissive
parents aren’t allowed to feel responsible for their own
actions. So in the middle of the night, they call for an adult to
fix their problem of getting back to sleep. Early on, these kids
discover that they can just let Mom or Dad do it — they don’t
need to figure out the solution for themselves.
Chapter 3: Personality: A Big Piece of the Puzzle 51

 Drill sergeants expect the impossible. Parents who demand
unquestioning obedience often have unrealistic expectations.
For instance, a parent may expect a 3-month-old to sleep
through the night, not realizing that newborn tummies need
frequent fill-ups. The result is frustration for everyone.
By now you can see that gentle-boss parents have the best luck
getting their tots to fall asleep and stay in bed. These parents
encourage their tots to take big steps toward independence (like
sleeping through the night or moving from the crib to a big bed).
They can be flexible when life demands it — for instance, when a
big life change keeps a tot wide-awake — but gentle bosses know
that sometimes Mom and Dad need to call the shots.
Evaluating your parenting style
If you’re one of the gentle-boss parents, you’re already on the right
track and our only advice is to stay on it. You’ll still have your
share of frustrations — because even the easiest kid on the block
can’t get through life without a few bumps in the road — but prob-
lems should pass quickly if you keep responding with firm guid-
ance, flexibility when necessary, and a loving touch.
If you’re not a gentle-boss type, take a look at your current parent-
ing style and see whether it needs some tinkering. Of course, as we
note earlier in this chapter, your parenting style stems in part from
your own personality. That’s a core part of who you are, so we
don’t want you to change it (and you couldn’t if you tried).
Luckily, however, you do have a big say in how you express that
personality. If your parenting style isn’t working out as well as
you’d like — especially at nighty-night time — consider the follow-
ing questions. They may lead you to refine your style and solve
some big sleepy-time issues along the way.
Are you too permissive?
If you’re a softie who’s starting to realize that love isn’t all your
sweetie needs to stay on the right track, start offering her some
guidance with these steps:
1. Define the rules that matter to you and decide on limits.
You can explain the new rules to an older toddler, and your
calm follow-through can help a non-verbal tot get the mes-
sage as well.
2. Set a routine. See Chapter 5 for a detailed explanation of
establishing routines. Understand that your child’s wails in
the middle of the night aren’t a sign of trauma — no matter
Part I: From A to ZZZZZ: The Basics of Sleep 
52

how loud and insistent they are. No doubt your little one is
mad as a wet hen, but by the next morning she doesn’t have
any hard feelings — just a well rested, ready-to-go attitude.
3. Follow through. Be kind and flexible, but be in charge.
Consistency is the key to solving bedtime puzzles. For
example, if you decide that it’s time for her to stop middle-
of-the-night visits to your bed, then each time your little
one makes the trek, you need to calmly take her back to
her room — and even gate her in if that’s the only way
she’ll stay. Your own exhaustion may tempt you to give in,
but just two or three days of standing firm can change your
world of sleep!
Are you too demanding?
If you fall into the drill-sergeant category, lighten up! You’re an
authority figure to your child, but that doesn’t mean your house
needs to run like a military school. Try these changes:
1. Set reasonable rules and decide on the consequences for
breaking them. Talk to your pediatrician or consult baby
books first to make sure you’re being realistic.
2. Let your rules do the talking. If you child decides to break
a rule, kindly but firmly impose the consequence — without
yelling or threatening.
When you let your child take the responsibility for making deci-
sions about her behavior, you do her and yourself a favor in the
long run. You also lower her stress level and keep sleepy-time calm
because your little angel isn’t lying awake at night, worrying about
your anger.
Are you on the same page as your partner?
If you and your partner are on the same wavelength for discipline,
bedtimes, and all the parenting decisions, great! But what if you
aren’t? Presenting a united front is awfully hard to do when you
can’t agree.
If that’s the case, you and your partner need to sit down and have
a serious talk. Lay out your ideas about parenting, figure out where
you’re on common ground and where you disagree, and then hash
out compromises that you both can accept. To help with these
steps, try these suggestions:
 Find a time when you and your partner can talk without 
interruptions. Getting a sitter may be worth the effort so the
two of you can head to the local coffee shop for an honest
conversation.
Chapter 3: Personality: A Big Piece of the Puzzle 53

 Bring paper and pencils. Separately, write down the biggest
sleep issues you’re facing and how you want to resolve them.
(For example, Mom thinks it’s okay to let Junior wander into
the master bedroom in the middle of the night, but Dad
misses his privacy.)
 Compare lists to see areas of overlap and areas of possible
compromise. Create a common list of goals.
 Discuss strategies for reaching these goals and decide who
will implement them. If Mom is the pushover, then maybe Dad
needs to be the middle-of-the-night enforcer.
 If you’re so far apart that you can’t reach a compromise, con-
sider reaching out to a community parenting program or an
individual mediator who can help arbitrate the process. In
most cases, sleep is just the most pressing of several issues.
Getting on the same page as your partner will impact your
parenting styles through the years and through lots of differ-
ent stages.
The more you stray toward being permissive or authoritarian in
your decisions, the more bedtime battles you can anticipate. And if
that prediction isn’t an argument for meeting in the middle at the
gentle-boss style, we don’t know what is!

ongratulations! As a brand-new parent, you’re enjoying one 
of life’s most joyous experiences: holding your precious new
little son or daughter in your arms after so many long months of
waiting. Nothing can prepare you for the mixture of love and awe
you feel when you look into that little face and realize what an
amazing gift you’ve been given.
If you’re like most new parents, you’ll spend a large part of these
early months walking on clouds. Of course, no matter how blissful
you are, you’re also dragging around like a zombie, realizing that a
good night’s sleep is a luxury of the past (at least for now).
Whichever condition you’re in, blissful or zombified — or both! —
keep one word in mind throughout these first six months: change.
In this chapter, we describe the remarkable transformations that
occur over the first six months of your baby’s life and how they
relate to sleep. You also discover why some little ones think day-
time is for sleeping and nighttime is for partying — a pattern that
can have already-frazzled parents pulling their hair out. (Don’t
worry, it’s only temporary!) In addition, you get the inside story on
cures for colic, the pros and cons of pacifiers, and the crucial steps
to keeping your little one safe and sound.

The Ride of Life: Baby’s 
Early Development
No other time in life is as full of change as a baby’s first six months.
During some spurts, the rate of weight gain equals fifty pounds per
year, and the rate of growth equals 24 inches a year. (Fortunately
that’s just temporary or you’d need a bigger crib!)
Parallel to this astonishing physical growth, your little one rapidly
develops new abilities and interests. She has no idea how to talk,
move from one spot, or imagine anything beyond the present. And
yet, within a year, she’s taking her first steps, trying out sounds 
or even words, and developing an active, conscious imagination.
During that time, she moves from total dependence toward a
remarkable little person with a flowering mind and a personality 
of her own.
As these exciting first months go by, something else changes: your
baby’s ability to sleep. Each week she figures out this strange busi-
ness of snoozing and waking a little bit better, and — slowly but
surely — she gets it right.
The first two months: 
Baby meets world
It’s amazing how much time a newborn spends sleeping — and, at
the same time, how often he rousts you out of bed. To understand
how your newborn sleeps and why he needs to wake up so often,
consider his waking life:
 The newness of it all: Imagine going from the warm, cozy pre-
dictability of the womb to a big, bright, noisy, chaotic world.
By comparison, the changes that grownups face, like moving
to a new town or changing jobs, seem tiny.
 The total lack of routine: The newborn doesn’t have a clue
what’s going to occur in the next two days, two hours, or even
two minutes. Even his own poops can surprise the heck out of
him! From his point of view, the world is utterly new and
unpredictable.
Knowing what time it is: Baby meets circadian rhythm
Many little creatures know just what to do with their lives from the
get-go. Fish start swimming; spiders start spinning. Human babies,
however, haven’t the foggiest idea what to do next because they
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
58

greet the world at a much earlier stage of development than most
other animals. They’re born with innate personalities and Dad’s
hair color or Aunt Jane’s dimple, but a sense of daily activities?
They’re clueless.
This lack of programming makes your baby remarkably adaptable —
he can fall into just about any routine or lifestyle that life hands 
him — and the exciting potential to do anything and become anyone
is one of life’s greatest miracles. But starting life brand new has its
drawbacks when daily routines are involved.
The flip side of your baby’s talent for adapting is that he has to
start from scratch with a biological clock that isn’t set yet. As a
result, the tiny time-telling molecules in his body simply make a
wild guess as to day and night — and that means that he can be
hungry, sleepy, or wide awake at any hour of the day or night.
About one-third of babies get it right, another third are in the ball-
park, and one-third are way off-base (so having a newborn with a
correctly-set inner alarm clock is probably pure luck). As a result,
most new moms and dads find their baby’s sleeplessness the
biggest challenge of the first six months.
However, even infants got rhythm, their own sense of the day/night
cycle. Just like all humans, babies have a circadian rhythm — a pow-
erful internal clock that helps create a daily cycle. (See Chapter 2 for
more details.) By the time they’re about 6 weeks old, most little ones
feel tired at night, become more alert in the day, feel hungrier in the
daylight hours than after dark, and even want to cuddle a little more
at night. They start to figure out that daytime is for play, exploration,
and eating, but night is the time to take it easy.
The one-third of babies that get this cycle backwards develop a
very strong day-and-night reversal. They’re as hungry as truckers
in the middle of the night, and a hurricane can’t rouse them during
the day. That’s good evidence of the strength of circadian rhythm,
even if it’s set to the wrong time zone!
Recognizing Baby’s big surprise: The feel of hunger
For his first six months in the womb, your little dumpling spent
nearly his whole life sound asleep. Even in the third trimester, he
snoozed almost constantly. Sleeping all day and all night was just
the ticket.
So why doesn’t he sleep now? Good question. Before he reached
the outside world, Mom’s body offered up all the food he needed.
But now he wakes up with this peculiar sensation in his tummy —
hunger. He’s not sure what it is, but he instinctively knows what to
do about it — cry! It’s his only way of saying, “Feed me.”
Chapter 4: Growing and Changing: Sleep from Birth to 6 Months 59

And boy, does he need to eat! Newborns require an astonishing
amount of food to fuel their rapid growth. If you calculate their
calorie intake per pound, the numbers works out to five times your
normal intake. Your little one is wolfing down food like a lumber-
jack, and he can’t do it all at once or he’d explode.
So he uses a smart strategy: He sucks down as much as his tummy
can hold and drops off to sleep again for two or three hours (three
to four if you’re really lucky) till his tummy signals him again. Then
he hollers for more. He needs to eat this often, around the clock,
for at least the first few weeks. And your best strategy for these
first two months? Total surrender.
Right now, your newborn has an ironclad excuse for rousting you
out of bed every few hours: He really needs to eat that often. So let
him call the shots for the first two months. This means feeding him
every time he yells and resigning yourself to lose lots of sleep. Bid
a fond farewell to long, luxurious slumbers. Seek out and be happy
with opportunities to catnap for a few hours at a stretch while
your baby rests.
There’s a bright side in all this chaos: As you wait on your infant
hand and foot, you begin to find surprising joy in caring for this
little human being. The total change in your own routine shocks

Stories from the crib: Three strategies,
three winning families
At 5 months of age, little Keiko still woke up every four or five hours. As it turned
out, in the middle of her fifth month, Keiko started sleeping through the night all on
her own — and she’s been doing it ever since.
Molly and Jack, on the other hand, felt a sense of urgency to sleep all night. When
Billy was 4 months old, Molly and Jack started using the strategies we outline in
Chapter 5 to help him figure out how to sleep through the night.
Laura, the oldest of three kids, had watched her mother matter-of-factly plunk her
siblings in their cribs, shut the door, and wait for them to quiet down. She knew this
technique worked fast and tried it with her infant Sarah. By the third night, Sarah
snuggled down with barely a whimper. By the fourth, she was asleep almost before
Laura shut the door.
Which parents made the right choice? All of them — because they picked the solu-
tions that worked best for their lifestyles and their babies.

your system into focusing totally and intensely on your cherub.
You’re physically forced to attend to who he is, what he wants, 
and when he wants it. This round-the-clock connection, although
stressful at times when you’re short on shuteye, draws you even
closer to your little one — perhaps as close as you can be.
Catching a ray of hope: 
2 to 4 months
One night, when your baby is between 6 and 16 weeks old, some-
thing astonishing will happen: You’ll wake up to your little one’s
cries, look at your clock, and think, “Wow! I’ve been asleep six
whole hours!” Of course, the very fact that this surprises you
means that those frequent feedings aren’t history yet.
This magic moment is a big deal, however, because it signals your
baby’s first step toward being civilized. She’s getting in the groove —
falling into synch with her world — and she’s doing it all by herself.
Until now, your baby’s life was a swirl of unpredictable, frequent
interruptions of sleep at all hours of the day and night. But sud-
denly your sweetie is staying awake for longer stretches during 
the day. With no planning, preparation, or charts (without even
reading this book!), she begins to master the key element of being
human — the ability to stay awake long enough to learn, work and
play. She’s truly awake and aware for much of the day — and
you’re truly out like a light for more of the night.
More order, less chaos: 
4 to 6 months
By the time they reach the 4-month mark (give or take a few
weeks), nearly all babies tease their parents with the occasional
surprise night off. But these clever babes have a secret they usu-
ally don’t reveal: Most of them are now able to routinely sleep
through the night without a meal or a visit from Mom or Dad.
Some babies do let their parents in on this secret and start sleep-
ing through the night all by themselves. These little ones go from
sleeping three hours at a stretch to five, seven, and then nine
hours nonstop. If this doesn’t happen in your household, check out
the next section, “Guiding Your Baby on the Path to Mature Sleep,”
for some solutions to your nighttime woes.
Chapter 4: Growing and Changing: Sleep from Birth to 6 Months 61

Guiding Your Baby on the 
Path to Mature Sleep
If you’re like lots of parents, you probably feel a little conflicted right
now. On the one hand, you really want to sleep like a normal human
being again. On the other, the realization that your tot’s ready to
snooze all night on his own — his first big step into the big-kid 
world — can make you think, “My baby’s growing up too soon!”
And that’s why you may have mixed feelings about his sleeping
through the night at the 4-month mark without a meal or a cuddle.
But when he starts settling into an all-night sleep schedule, you
still have plenty of time for hugs and cuddles in the daytime.
What’s more, you have lots of extra energy for playtime. So take
heart, and don’t fear this step into the future — the fun is just
beginning!
Setting your baby’s internal clock
As we discuss earlier in this chapter, many babies need help falling
in sync with their circadian rhythms — and who better to help
than their loving parents? The happy news is that, eventually, even
little night owls shift into a very regular pattern of being awake in
the day and asleep at night, and this change usually doesn’t take
more than six to eight weeks. These are long, long, long weeks, but
you can help your baby’s little clock reset more quickly by letting
her get Mother Nature’s signals loud and clear. Here’s how:
 During the day, throw open the windows and let the light
stream in. Play music, generate lots of hustle and bustle, and
schedule a little outdoor activity if the weather is fine.
 Do just the opposite as night approaches. Turn down the
lights, make as little noise as possible, and turn off the televi-
sion and radio. Also, for the most part, avoid talking. (Even
that “quiet old lady whispering hush” in Goodnight Moon
needs to keep her lips sealed!) Feed, cuddle, massage, and
hold your baby as quietly as possible.
These simple tricks help remove distracting influences and allow
your baby’s body to pay attention to the ultimate clock-setters,
your local sunrise and sunset. In time, the sun’s rhythm can trigger
chemical reactions that reset your baby’s inner timepiece. And
with that goal accomplished, day and night flip-flops become a
ghost of the past . . . at least until the teenage years!

Homing in on the sleepy-
time bandit: You
If you’re still getting up at all hours of the night after your baby
reaches the 4-month mark, you can be heartened by the news that
your situation is temporary. At this point, most babies are physically
ready to sleep through the night. They’ve plumped up nicely — you’ll
be surprised when you compare pictures of your tiny, wiry newborn
to the roly-poly bambino you’re holding today — and they’re growing
much more slowly. Their tummies don’t really need middle-of-the-
night fill-ups any more, and most of them can comfort themselves to
sleep. These two skills — eating enough during the day and getting to
sleep — are all a baby needs to doze all night long.
So, if your baby’s still waking up when he reaches these mile-
stones, only one reason stands out — you. As he sleeps, your baby
cycles in and out of deep sleep (more on this in Chapter 2). When
he hits that moment of near-waking, he has a decision to make:
Wake up or head back to sleep? If he chooses Door Number One,
it’s usually because you’re still hopping out of bed to give him a
snack and a snuggle.
To address this situation, you first need to make a decision:
 Are you desperate to get past the sleepless stage?
 Are you willing to wait a few more months before encouraging
your little one to drop his middle-of-the-night demands?
Either choice is perfectly fine, but you need to decide what works
best for your lifestyle, your work schedule, and your sanity. If you
feel fully ready to proceed with helping your infant sleep all night,
Chapter 5 walks you through the steps. If not, the next section
helps you weigh your options and make a decision.
Knowing when you’re ready to give
up the late-night snuggles
Just as your 4-month-old emerges from the newborn phase expecting
you to be on call 24/7, you too have acquired certain expectations —
the key one being to hustle when your baby screams. As a result, you
each have a pattern going. Hers is, “Wake up, cry, wait for Mom or
Dad to show up.” Yours is, “Wake up, hear cry, respond.”
Chapter 4: Growing and Changing: Sleep from Birth to 6 Months 63

The call-and-response pattern made perfect sense a few months ago,
but now it’s just a habit for both you and Baby. You can start chang-
ing that habit now or wait as long as you like. Here are three ways to
approach this stage (there’s no right or wrong decision here):
 You can keep going to your baby whenever she calls for
you. You’ll be tired for a few extra weeks, but you can’t spoil
your baby or even set irreversible patterns by giving in to her
demands at this stage. If you’re lucky, your baby may decide
on her own to start sleeping through the night. If so, you’ll be
off the hook.
 You can simply stop responding to your baby’s cries if
you’re sure she’s okay. You can expect your baby to scream
bloody murder for two nights and then start sleeping angeli-
cally. This is the quickest road to a good night’s sleep, but it’s
also one that many parents can’t face. This approach doesn’t
traumatize your baby, but, if it makes you uncomfortable,
don’t try it.
 You can employ the strategies we outline in Chapter 5 for
gently but firmly easing your baby into an all-night sleep
routine. These strategies work for nearly all babies over the
age of 4 months. (Although babies are generally ready for this
approach at the 4-month mark, many parents aren’t!)
Whichever option you pick, be sure you follow this all-important
rule: Don’t change your mind midstream! Weigh your options,
make your best choice, and then stick with it for at least a week or
two to give your baby the best chance to adapt. Otherwise, you
confuse your baby, and she spends many nights testing you in an
attempt to figure out what game you’re playing. Sticking to your
guns is far easier on both of you.
Safety First, but Also Comfort
No matter which sleep strategy you choose, two topics are all-
important: keeping your angel safe and ensuring that he’s comfy.
Here are our top tips on both fronts.
Keeping your baby safe 
while she sleeps
When it comes to babies and sleep, no topic is more important
than safety — and for babies under 1 year of age, no safety topic is
more important than sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). For an
excellent review of the subject, see the American Academy of
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
64

Pediatrics’ recent statement on SIDS at http://pediatrics.
aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/116/5/1245. This section
provides a summary of SIDS and how to keep your tot safe.
Understanding what SIDS is
SIDS is one of life’s greatest tragedies. Fortunately, it’s rare and get-
ting rarer. In 1991, SIDS struck more than 1 in 1,000 infants. Thanks
to new safety measures, that rate dropped by 50 percent by 2001;
SIDS now strikes slightly more than 1 in 2,000 babies. To put that
number in perspective for worried parents, nearly 1,999 of every
2,000 babies don’t fall victim to SIDS.
Doctors use the term SIDS to describe any sudden, unexplained
death during a baby’s first year of life. Most cases of SIDS (about 
75 percent) occur between the ages of 1 and 4 months, and the risk
drops rapidly after that period. SIDS is more common (but still
rare) in premature infants and babies exposed to cigarette smoke.
For premature infants, the risk goes up with the severity of prema-
turity (see Chapter 12 for details about prematurity). For infants
born at 28-32 weeks of pregnancy, the SIDS risk is roughly double
that for full-term babies, rising with increasing prematurity and
dropping closer to term. Some studies suggest that the risk of SIDS
is as much as five times higher for a baby exposed to tobacco
smoke (more in the next section).
SIDS rates are dropping for two reasons:
 SIDS, by definition, are only unexplained deaths. As doctors
continue to identify more medical problems that can lead to
SIDS, fewer cases go unexplained.
 A few years ago, doctors reported this wonderful discovery:
Simply putting a baby to sleep on his back rather than on his
tummy can cut the risk of SIDS in half! Parents are reducing
the risk by following this advice.
Protecting your kid from SIDS
If you remember nothing else that we tell you about bedtime
safety, remember this: Back to Sleep! Simply put, your baby should
always sleep on his back. Note: This also means no sleeping on his
side. It’s not as risky as being on his tummy, but it’s not as safe as
being on his back. We illustrate a good sleep setup for Baby in
Figure 4-1a and a dangerous one in Figure 4-1b.
What if your baby rolls from his back to his tummy? The accepted
belief is that babies who are mobile enough to roll over have a
lower risk of SIDS because they can get themselves out of an
uncomfortable or stressful position. So put your baby on his 
back, but don’t fret too much if you find him on his tummy later.
Chapter 4: Growing and Changing: Sleep from Birth to 6 Months 65

Figure 4-1: Crib safety: a) A good setup; b) A bad setup.
Following the back-to-sleep rule is just one way to protect your
little one against the threat of SIDS. In the following list we identify
more guidelines that can help keep him safe. (This list features the
most powerful approaches first, but be sure to read them all.)
 Smoking is a very strong risk factor for SIDS. In fact, some
studies show that a baby’s risk is five times higher if the baby
is exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy or after birth.
Because this is one of the most powerful risk factors for SIDS,
be very careful not to expose your baby to tobacco smoke!
If you’re a smoker who’s reading this book before your baby
arrives, do your best to quit. If your little one is already here,
make his entire home a smoke-free zone. Even second-hand
smoke a floor away increases the risk of SIDS.
 Some studies show a strong link between SIDS and soft bed-
ding, pillows, and face-covering blankets. We don’t know
why, but soft bedding is dangerous even if your baby sleeps
on his back. The risk of SIDS can go up as much as five-fold if
Baby has a soft mattress, fluffy pillows, or blankets that can
cover his face.
 Sofas, couches, and waterbeds are not good sleeping spots.
All of these can increase the risk of SIDS, so nix them and put
your sweetie to sleep on a real bed with a firm mattress.
 Pacifiers may reduce the risk of SIDS (see the following 
section “The Power of the Pacifier”). The extent to which 
they may reduce this risk is still unclear, but many studies
state that using a pacifier can cut the risk of SIDS by more
than 50 percent.
 Baby’s room should be at a comfy but not-too-warm temper-
ature (65 to 72 degrees F). This small change may help to
reduce the risk of SIDS, so avoid cranking up the thermostat.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
66

 Breastfeeding is associated with less chance of SIDS. The
incidence of SIDS appears lower in breast-fed infants, but stud-
ies link this protection to the fact that mothers who breastfeed
tend to smoke less. Breastfeeding itself doesn’t appear to offer
special protection against SIDS. So if you bottle-feed your
infant, don’t fret about raising the risk of SIDS. (Of course,
breastfeeding offers many other health advantages.)
 Though it’s a controversial issue, co-sleeping may increase
the risk of SIDS. In Chapter 9, we look at the controversy over
co-sleeping and whether it increases or decreases the risk of
SIDS. If you co-sleep, be sure to read and follow the bed safety
rules (as well as the taboos on smoking or drinking alcohol)
we list in that chapter.
 Gadgets and gimmicks have no proof of working. The evi-
dence is clear-cut: Products that claim to prevent or reduce
SIDS aren’t proven to be effective or even safe, including home
monitors and even prescribed units. (However, these moni-
tors do have their place in protecting against a different
breathing problem in premature infants — see Chapter 12.)
Employing the power of the pacifier
When you’re bored or fretful, you have plenty of ways to do some-
thing about it — e-mail a friend, go for a bike ride, read a good
book, curl up on the couch and watch television, and so on.
Your little one, on the other hand, has a pretty short list of enter-
tainment options. She can’t move from one spot to another, she’s
too young to read a novel, and even the plotline of Days of Our
Lives is a little over her head (thank goodness!). So she does what
she knows best — she sucks on stuff.
Sucking is at the top of every baby’s top-ten list of favorite activities
(right up there with cuddling and gazing at the wallpaper patterns)
because eating is one of the very few activities that your baby has
down pat even just after birth. In fact, her very survival depends on
feeding, so the urge to suck is a powerful one. Many babies become
frantic if they go for very long without something to suck on.
Enter the pacifier — with lots of big advantages:
 It’s a great comfort when your baby’s discovering how to
get herself to sleep.
 It’s safe (in fact, sucking on a pacifier may lower your baby’s
risk of SIDS — see the previous section).
 It’s easy to wash.
Chapter 4: Growing and Changing: Sleep from Birth to 6 Months 67

However, pacifiers do have a few drawbacks:
 A few newborns resist nursing if they use a pacifier. Typically
this happens within the first three weeks, when a baby begins
to nurse. When your baby has nursing all figured out, pacifiers
are much less likely to cause any feeding problems.
 Pacifiers get lost in the middle of the night. However, most
parents think the occasional squawk from a baby who’s lost
her binkie is a fair trade-off for the hours of peace that a paci-
fier brings. Also, as you begin to use the sleep strategies in
this book, your baby learns to comfort herself when her
beloved piece of plastic vanishes.
 Pacifiers can cause a baby’s teeth to shift forward. Luckily,
pacifiers only affect the teeth that are already in, not the adult
teeth. So if you can get rid of that pacifier before your little
one turns 5 years old — and we certainly recommend that you
do! — her next set of teeth will come in just fine.
Another complaint is that they’re hard to quit. In most cases, this
isn’t true. If you decide to get rid of the pacifier in the first year or
two, eliminating it can be surprisingly easy. If your toddler is older
and has some grasp of language, discuss the change ahead of time.
(One ploy: If another little one is joining your family, see whether
your toddler is willing to give the pacifier to your new arrival as 
a gift.)
Overall, pacifiers are more of a blessing than a curse, and they
save you and your baby lots of grief — especially on those nights
when your sweetie finds sleep to be a challenge. We think they’re a
very reasonable choice.
The Greatest Common Obstacle:
Myths and Facts about Colic
Ask a doctor, “What’s colic?” and you get an answer like this, “A
state of sustained and strong crying lasting more than three hours
a day, which has no known cause and does not respond to the
usual comforts like eating, massages, being held, or getting a
diaper change.”
Ask a parent, however, and you probably hear, “It’s a nightmare —
an eternity of shrill cries that can sand the ears off an elephant; a
form of torture that makes bamboo splints under the fingernails
sound like sissy stuff; a horrible experience of listening to your
baby suffer at decibel levels that can shatter glass!”
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
68

Both definitions seem pretty clear, but this common and upsetting
problem was the center of uncommon controversy for years. The
biggest question was: Is colic a real condition, or are babies with
colic in pain from a painful medical problem that makes them
unhappy?
Until recently, doctors had few clues to go on. They did know:
 Babies with colic typically show no signs of a problem at
birth.
 They have lots of problems starting around 1 month of age.
 They get back to normal around 3 months of age.
 Setting colicky babies on a vibrating surface often makes them
feel better.
These facts weren’t a lot to go on, so until the 1990s (and even a bit
beyond), colic remained a mystery.
The myths about colic
Over the years, doctors spun many theories about the roots of
colic. They were all wrong, but we’re going to describe a couple 
of them so you’re ready in case someone inflicts them on you.
The worst theory was that tense parents caused colicky babies, an
idea that caused zillions of parents unnecessary guilt. Fortunately,
this theory got the boot before you became a parent — but you
may still hear it from one of your relatives.
More recently, doctors thought that a colicky baby hadn’t grown
up enough to handle emotions. As a result, so this theory went,
babies who didn’t know how to manage their feelings fell into fits
of crying and couldn’t stop. This theory, however, failed to answer
a key question: Why do babies with colic seem to be in so much
physical pain?
The facts about colic
Thanks to recent medical findings, doctors now know that two
minor (although painful) conditions underlie most cases of colic:
allergies and stomach acid. This discovery is very good news for
parents because both problems have safe, fast, and simple reme-
dies. Here’s the scoop on each culprit and its remedy:
Chapter 4: Growing and Changing: Sleep from Birth to 6 Months 69

Villain #1: Allergies
Doctors used to think babies couldn’t have allergies before 2 years
of age. Recently, however, doctors discovered that many newborns
who scream in terrible pain have inflamed intestines as the result
of food allergies. These babies almost instantly recover from colic
and start having normal poops when their parents stop feeding
them the foods to which they’re allergic.
In addition, the proteins in a mom’s diet can pass unchanged right
into her breast milk. So, if you eat yogurt for lunch and then breast-
feed a baby who’s allergic to milk, you can expect trouble ahead.
Add up these two facts — little tykes can be allergic, and even
moms who breastfeed can deliver the foods that make them 
suffer — and you have one very good answer to the question,
“What causes colic?”
If this is your baby’s problem, work with your pediatrician to figure
out which foods cause the reaction and then eliminate them:
 If Mom is breastfeeding, the bad guys usually are proteins
from cow’s milk, soy, or other foods, and the answer is to have
Mom stop all intake of the troublesome foods.
 If Baby takes a bottle, the soy or cow’s milk in infant formulas
can cause the problem, and the solution is to feed your baby an
elemental formula (all of the proteins are broken down; it’s still
nutritious but no longer causes allergies). Your pediatrician can
tell you whether this approach makes sense for your tot.
Villain #2: Tummy acid
For years, doctors failed to consider stomach acid as a cause for
colic for the same reason that they ignored allergies: They thought
babies were too young for this problem.
Recently, however, research proved otherwise. Studies show that
heartburn (also called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease,
GERD) can make babies just as miserable as it makes grownups.
Heartburn occurs when acid from your stomach burns the lining of
your esophagus or intestine (the parts right before or after the
stomach). Most people have stomach acid capable of causing this
problem, but they also have protective linings — like oven mitts —
that keep the acid from reaching sensitive spots. If the lining devel-
ops a gap, the acid can seep through and burn . . . Ouch! But, you
ask, nearly everyone has stomach acid and nearly all babies have
acid that washes up into their esophagus (do you know any babies
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
70

who never spit up?), so why do only some babies suffer from heart-
burn? We don’t know — but we do know that a whole lot of babies
have this problem.
When adults feel the pain of heartburn, they usually grab an
antacid. But babies have only one way of saying they hurt — they
cry their hearts out. Luckily, if heartburn is causing your baby’s
pain and tears, these solutions can help:
 Your pediatrician can recommend safe and simple medications
that actually stop production of stomach acid altogether.
Stomach acid appears to have little benefit and stopping its
production does little harm — at least for a few months, until
your sweetie outgrows the risk of heartburn.
 Keep your baby upright after a meal to reduce the chance for
that burning stomach acid to splash up into his esophagus.
 Elevate the head of your baby’s crib a little bit, which also
helps to keep stomach acid in the tummy.
 If you bottle-feed your baby, thicken the feeding by adding
just a little bit of rice cereal. Again, this helps to keep acid in
the stomach, where it belongs.
Many, many babies with colic have treatable problems, but a few
don’t. These infants cry their little hearts out for the first few
months even when doctors eliminate every known culprit. The
cause probably has a good explanation . . . but medical science
needs to discover it. The good news is that even in this situation,
the crying jags usually stop after the 3-month mark. So hang in
there — there’s a light at the end of the tunnel!

A
re you the only parent at playgroup who’s still wearing sun-
glasses to hide under-eye circles? If so, don’t despair. Babies
have a wide range of personalities and sleep requirements, and
some just need a little extra time and encouragement to develop a
sleep routine.
In this chapter, you discover the tricks to getting your little cutie to
follow a routine: creating your own beddy-bye ritual; changing the
menu at mealtimes in ways that encourage longer sleep; and gently
and kindly setting limits on the nighttime demands she makes on
you. All these techniques add up to more hours of sleep (and more
energetic days) for you and your little one.
Your baby’s sleep habits don’t change overnight (no pun intended);
it takes days or even weeks. But with patience, you’ll finally experi-
ence the nirvana of sleeping until the alarm clock rings. And with a
little time, this stretch becomes the rule, not the exception.
Knowing When You and Baby 
Are Ready to Sleep All Night
Sleeping through the night is a milestone on the road to independ-
ence, and deciding whether or not to sleep is the first real choice
your little one makes in her young life. Meanwhile, you’ll earn a
gold star in parenting for helping her take that first baby step
toward being a big kid.

The question, “Can my little one make it through a whole night
alone?” doesn’t have a one-size-fits-all answer. As a rule, however,
most babies are physically ready to sleep through the night when
they reach 4 months of age. (See Chapter 4 for more about this
readiness.) Object permanence may help one sleep all night with-
out calling for parents and develops at about 9 months of age —
we discuss this topic in greater detail in Chapter 6.
So why are we talking about this issue in a chapter on babies 6 to
12 months old? Good question! This is the time when most parents
feel comfortable setting some limits for their little ones. Although
some parents may start trying a little earlier (with good reason),
many choose to wait until the six-month mark before taking active
steps to change the bedtime rules. The plan is good because it vir-
tually guarantees that your angel is ready — and that you’ve had
enough midnight cuddles.
Because each family is unique, factor in both your baby’s readiness
and your own needs and feelings when deciding whether now is
the right moment for your baby to take this big step.
Knowing when Baby is set 
to sleep the night away
How can you feel confident that your sweetheart is ready to be
alone in that crib all night? Ask yourself these questions to make
that decision:
 Can your baby fall asleep on his own? In other words, if you
put him down in his crib before he’s fully asleep, can he take
the last step to the Land of Nod all by himself?
If your baby falls asleep on his own and doesn’t need his
nighttime snacks but still rousts you at 1 or 2 a.m., he’s proba-
bly more interested in a little face time with Mom or Dad than
a meal. Waking up every few hours has become a desire, not a
need, and he’s ready to sleep through the night. (See Chapter
1 for more on needs versus desires.)
 Can your baby consume all the calories he needs during the
daylight hours? The answer is yes, unless your tot arrived
prematurely (see Chapter 12 for info on early-birds’ feeding
needs). Babies as young as 4 months of age are big enough —
and their growth is slow enough — that they don’t need a
midnight snack. (See the later section “Using Calorie Shifting
to Reset Your Baby’s Clock” for specific suggestions on how to
eliminate nighttime feedings.)
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
74

 Is your baby healthy and not dealing with a chronic issue
that can interfere with sleep? A health problem can compli-
cate feeding and sleep issues, so check with your pediatrician
about any health issues before you assume that the runway is
clear for all-night slumber. (See Chapter 13 for details on deal-
ing with sleep and health problems.)
Some babies do have legitimate nighttime needs at this age. 
Babies who were born early, are ill, or are able to eat only a little 
at a single feeding may still need to wake at night to feed. In these
cases, the techniques in this chapter are still helpful — but you
need to wait a few extra weeks or months before trying them.
This leaves only one question: Are you ready?
Making sure you’re on your mark
If your baby has the skills and maturity to sleep all night, that’s 
half the battle. The other half is making sure your own heart is in
the game.
If you’re like most parents, you’re torn between the guilt that
comes with not satisfying your baby’s every wish and the desire of
wanting a good night’s sleep so you can feel human again. Maybe
you’re secretly reluctant to give up that little late-night cuddle, but
you’re also more and more grouchy, exhausted, and (admit it)
resentful each time a loud shriek drags you out of bed.
These conflicting emotions can make your decisions about all-
night sleeping a little complicated. But at this stage, the ball is in
your court and not your baby’s. There’s no right or wrong deci-
sion, so you need to find the balance that works for you and your
tot. What follows are a few guideposts to help you along the way:
 Don’t confuse helping your baby get to sleep with letting
your baby cry. Crying is the sideshow (and you may hear lots
of it in upcoming weeks!), but it’s not really the main issue.
Instead, stay focused on this point: Are you still getting your
baby to sleep, or is your baby figuring out how to get herself
to sleep? Your goal is to help her reach independence in this
big life-skill, so don’t let her distract you with those tears. If
she manipulates you into feeling guilty, you both have lots of
sleepless nights ahead.
 If you’re making this decision with a partner, be sure you’re
both totally committed to this step. If one partner is prepared
and the other isn’t, you can’t be consistent and your tot will
play the more reluctant parent like a violin. Better to wait a
few weeks (or even months) than to apply your sleepy-time
strategies halfheartedly.
Chapter 5: Getting the Hang of It: Sleep from 6 to 12 Months 75

When you’ve decided the time is right, give yourself a quick reality
check with these reminders before you set the dreams in motion:
 Understand that sleeping through the night means different
things to different people. Ideally, sleeping through the night
means you and your baby feel rested and ready to take on the
day. For some families that means a full ten hours of beauty
rest for their little one, but other families are just fine with a
quick 2 a.m. feeding or an early human alarm clock.
 Be prepared for a little frustration. Don’t be surprised, for
example, if your little angel sleeps blissfully through the night
for weeks and then goes back to screaming like a banshee at 
2 a.m. A baby’s rest is often disturbed right before important
developmental surges, and many of those developments
occur during the 6-to-12-month stage.
Establishing a Bedtime Routine
At this point in your baby’s life, routine is the key word. (By this 
we mean a predictable schedule for day and night activities.) At this
age your baby is ready to get into the habit of eating and sleeping
on a fairly regular timetable. If he doesn’t quite have that schedule
thing down, don’t fret — this section offers effective approaches to
help your wee one adjust his timetable to yours.
Some simple pointers 
to get you started
By the time your baby is 6 months old, she starts to associate
familiar routines with bedtime. The goal of these rituals is to gradu-
ally ease her from the busyness of daytime into the relaxation of
evening, preparing her both mentally and physically for bed. In
time, you’ll have your own favorite nighty-night rituals, but these
guidelines work well for many parents:
 Set a bedtime. This time can be flexible, but try to keep it
fairly consistent. Babies vary in their need for sleep, and typi-
cal bedtimes range from as early as 7 p.m. to as late as 9 p.m.
Of course, your work schedule and your preferences factor
into your decision.
Don’t fall for the idea that keeping your baby up until she’s
absolutely exhausted encourages her to sleep in. That ploy
usually doesn’t work — and likely leads to a major meltdown
when she’s overtired.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
76

 Consider the day she’s had and be somewhat flexible. For
instance, if your child just paid her first visit to Chuck E.
Cheese, she’s probably over-stimulated (and possibly still 
getting over the trauma of being hugged by a giant rat), so
keep the bedtime ritual as calm and quiet as possible. On the
other hand, if she had a lazy day indoors, she may not be tired
enough to sleep well. If that’s the case, see whether you can
work in a little activity before you start your bedtime routine.
 Get a head start. Start setting the mood for bedtime 30 to 45
minutes before you want to put your baby down for the night.
Do this by turning off lights, putting on soft music, and turning
off the television.
If your child is an infant, feed her before bedtime, stopping
when she’s drowsy but not yet fully asleep. You may need to
rouse her gently to make sure she doesn’t conk out too early.
As we note earlier, much of the work in getting your baby to
snooze all night centers on teaching her how to get herself to
sleep — so you don’t want to do the job for her.
 Dress for success. Change your baby into comfy jammies with
no frills, buttons, or tags that can poke, bind, or itch. One of
the most common mistakes is overdoing bedtime warmth.
Babies can control their body temperatures just as well as
adults, so dress your baby in the same weight of clothing that
you’re comfortable wearing.
 Keep the lights down low. Some babies fall asleep easily in
the dark, and others like a little bit of light. If your little one
falls into the second category, invest in a dimmer switch and
turn the lights down low at crib time. After your baby falls
asleep, turn the light off.
Over time, this step accustoms her to sleeping in a totally
dark room (which can help keep sleep schedules on track). If
your infant gets used to sleeping in a dark room, the issue is
less likely to be a problem during toddler years.
Activities to help your 
baby wind down
Grownups like to read a book, watch a little television, eat a snack,
or take a leisurely walk to relax before bedtime. These rituals say,
“Forget the pressures of the day — it’s time to relax.” Your baby
can’t do any of these on his own, so you need to provide a little
quiet entertainment before sleepytime.
Chapter 5: Getting the Hang of It: Sleep from 6 to 12 Months 77

 Try a tubby-time. A little trial-and-error is necessary here
because some babies find baths restful and other babies rev
up in the tub. If a bath helps your baby calm down, give him
one before you change him into his jammies. If baths make
him wired, schedule them earlier in the day.
 Give your baby your magic touch. A gentle rubdown can help
melt tension away, and it’s a nice way to bond with your baby.
Rub a little oil (regular olive oil or baby oil works great!) on your
hands and give your little one a slow, relaxing head-to-toe mas-
sage. For more information on massaging your little one, pick up
a copy of Baby Massage For Dummies by Joanne Bagshaw and
Ilene Fox (Wiley). Figure 5-1 shows a good calming massage
technique — just run your hand along each side of your baby’s
body to lull him into dreamland (or at least sooth his nerves!).
 Read a good book. One of the best bedtime activities is story
time; simple, rhyming stories that have a sing-song verse or
pattern are particularly soothing. Besides helping your baby
to wind down, stories are a prime way to stimulate language
skills. Flip to Chapter 17 for a whole host of suggestions.
 Sing a little tune. Babies love singing, too, and a soft lullaby
while rocking can mellow out even the most wide-awake 
little one.

Lulling Baby beyond the yawns
When your baby is hovering on the edge of sleep, make your move.
Place her in her crib and quietly say something like, “Good night, I
love you, see you in the morning.” (And quietly pray that it is
morning before you see her again!)
Many babies like to hear soft music when they’re dozing off.
Musical patterns are powerfully pleasing to the brain and can mask
household sounds that disturb your little one’s sleep (especially if
other kids are in the house — sibs have a tough time turning down
the volume when a little one is trying to sleep). If you play the
same songs each night, the music also signals to your baby that
sleep is approaching.
Using Calorie Shifting to 
Reset Your Baby’s Clock
One of the best ways to help your baby sleep through the night is
to reset his tummy clock. The goal here is calorie shifting, gradually
decreasing your baby’s nighttime food without letting him get
hungry.
Calorie shifting works because the human body remembers when
it’s been fed. As a result, people fall into patterns based on when
they eat. For instance, people who regularly eat dinner at 10 p.m.
typically aren’t very hungry at 6 p.m. and vice versa.
The same is true of your baby. If you regularly give him a meal at 
2 a.m., his tummy says, “Feed me!” at 2 a.m. each day. If you want
to banish the middle-of-the-night bottle or breastfeeding, you need
to reset his internal clock — and it’s actually pretty easy.
When you use the calorie shifting technique, don’t fret about starv-
ing your little one. (If Grandma says you are, she’s wrong.) At any
given age, most babies take in a fairly constant number of calories
each 24 hours. If you cut down on the midnight snack, your baby
simply eats more during the day.
In effect, the calorie-shifting step we describe in the next few para-
graphs is the last step in a process you started when you introduced
cereals, fruits, and vegetables into your baby’s diet. That change
shifted your baby’s eating heavily toward the daytime. To ensure a
sound sleep, however, you want to tweak that balance even more.
Chapter 5: Getting the Hang of It: Sleep from 6 to 12 Months 79

If you’re breastfeeding
Moms who breastfeed can still reduce the number of nightly feedings
their babies need. When your little one wakes up during the night,
 Rub her back or sing to her to see whether you can comfort
her back to sleep without feeding her.
 Try to figure out which night feeding is of least interest to her;
try skipping that one each night.
 Send in Dad or anyone else capable of handling the baby
instead of Mom. The aroma of breast milk can stimulate your
baby to want to nurse.
 If you’re comfortable using bottles, consider giving your baby
a bottle of breast milk for night feedings, slowly diluting them
more each night until they’re basically water. (See the next
section.) Again, Dads may have more luck with this step.
By this age, nipple confusion (trouble returning to breastfeed-
ing after switching to a bottle) is no longer an issue. More
information on this topic is available in Your Baby’s First Year
For Dummies by James Gaylord and Michelle Hagan (Wiley).
If you’re bottle-feeding
If you’re bottle-feeding, use the following dilution strategy to
induce calorie-shifting:
 Choose the first night feeding that you want to eliminate, and
make the formula for that feeding 7⁄8 or 3⁄4 strength.
 If your baby takes this bottle well and is satisfied, gradually
decrease the strength of the formula by 1⁄8 or 1⁄4 until only water
is in the bottle.
Repeat this process for each nighttime feeding; before long, your
baby won’t be hungry at all during the night. At this point, he’s
waking you up for only one reason: It’s just so darned much fun!
And this is when you need to gently and lovingly change the rules
of the game.
Setting Limits with Love
When you know your little one is getting plenty of calories during
the day, you can be pretty sure that her primary reason for waking
is to see you. This is a powerful desire and one that your baby
expects to have satisfied.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
80

The key, however, is that it’s a desire, and not a need. Much of your
life as a parent will involve helping your child see the difference
between want and need, and the bedtime issue is your first big test.
(Believe it or not, it’s also one of the easiest. Wait until you explain
to your 13-year-old that she doesn’t need to wear eyeliner or tell
your 16-year-old that he doesn’t need his own car!)
Beginning to change your 
little one’s habits
Changing this appear-on-demand pattern starts not with your
baby, but with you. Your first step is to realize that your child will
be just fine if you change the pattern. You don’t traumatize him a
bit (if you have any concerns, see our discussion of disappoint-
ment versus trauma in Chapter 1) when you give him the chance,
gently and lovingly, to adapt to new expectations. The more power
you give your tot to discover that he can solve problems, the more
confidence he gains in his own strengths and abilities.
Of course, you’re biologically wired to react to those piteous
shrieks, so you need to recognize this situation as a chance for
your angel to learn. You’re not just being tough; you’re being wise.
Considering strategies 
to guide your way
Now that you know why your child needs to fall asleep on her own,
it’s time for specifics. Here’s an effective way to hand your love-bug
the keys to Sleepyland:
 Wait a minute or two when you hear your baby cry. She’ll
cycle between deep and light sleep stages three to four times
each night and may wake up for just a moment. If you run to
her at the first sign that she’s awake, she doesn’t have time to
make a natural transition back to a deep-sleep stage.
 Remember that crying isn’t a pick-up line. If your tot’s cry
sounds normal and you’re sure she’s fine, avoid picking her
up. This is a possible signal for play or even a feeding. Instead,
wait a bit to let her find her own way back to sleep.
If you’re ready to make the change to all-night sleeping, remember
this motto: If at first you don’t succeed, try again . . . and again . . .
and again! The best approach is setting a bedtime and a wake-up
time and not going into your child’s room in between — and con-
sistency is the biggest key to success. If she sees you even once
Chapter 5: Getting the Hang of It: Sleep from 6 to 12 Months 81

during this time, you reinforce her sense that you appear when she
cries. Typically, you need only two to four nights for your child to
change her expectations, give up the crying game, and sleep the
whole night.
Safety valves for high-pressure times
Even under the best of circumstance, you need to bend the rules a
little. Here are a couple of ideas:
 Know when your baby means business. If your sweetie’s
wide awake and his cry sounds different — really a howl —
then a visit is in order. Check to make sure that he isn’t sick,
stuck, or soaking wet. If all is fine, put him back in his crib,
rub his back, and let him know in a soothing voice that you’re
there. Some babies need Mom or Dad to stay until they drift
back to sleep, but others calm down quickly and can be left
while they’re still awake.
 Bring in reinforcements. We mention in the earlier section 
“If you’re breastfeeding” how the scent of breast milk can
make your baby work up an appetite. Obviously this problem
doesn’t occur if a guy takes over the night shift! For this and
other reasons — including those deep, rumbling male voices —
men seem to have especially good luck getting babies to conk
out. But any substitute can help, so ask a nanny, a mature
teenaged child, or a grandparent to take over the night duty 
if you’re lucky enough to have one of them on hand at 2 a.m.
 Don’t beat yourself up if you aren’t as firm as you’d like to
be. This may sound like a contradiction of the consistency-is-key
rule, but being at your beloved little tyrant’s beck and call is a
hard habit to break. Picking your little one up now and then
doesn’t cause a major setback — but try to resist the urge.
Handling Logistical Matters
Lots of factors, large and small, play a role in creating a successful
sleep routine. In this section we look at three of them: safety, com-
fort, and those all-important naps.
Making sure your nursery is 
safe for an escape artist
Your baby’s safety as she sleeps is a primary concern. To feel com-
fortable establishing a routine, you need to be sure your baby’s
crib is truly a safe place — even when she’s on her own.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
82

In the early months, safety-proofing your baby’s bedroom was
easy. Now, however, the rules are changing because your baby is
on the move in every direction — including up!
When your baby starts pulling up into a standing position:
 Remove bumper pads so she can’t climb up on them and
tumble out of the crib.
 Get rid of low-hanging mobiles.
 Make sure she can’t reach curtain pulls, pictures hanging on
the wall, or other potential dangers.
 Double-check the crib hardware to make sure everything’s
holding firm.
 Make sure all electrical outlets have safety plugs, even if you
think they’re too high for your baby to reach.
You’ll be amazed at what she can get into and climb up to during
the months to come.
Dealing with blankies 
and other treasures
You’ll probably notice that your baby becomes attached to certain
items — a cloth diaper, receiving blanket, or soft doll — as he
moves into the second half of his first year. If you ask your mom or
dad about your own baby days, you’ll probably find out that you
too had a lovie that comforted you and helped you feel safe.
These items are known as transitional objects because they remind
children of the love and nurturing they receive from their parents.
In effect, the beloved blankie or dolly acts as a bridge between
being with Mommy and Daddy and wanting to be with them.
A lovie can be a definite help at sleep time after your child hits the
12-month mark and is old enough to sleep with a stuffed toy or
blanket. A child who wakes during the night can embrace his spe-
cial lovie and use it as a tool to recall Mom’s or Dad’s presence and
be comforted back to sleep. Note: Don’t worry if your child doesn’t
have a favorite blanket or doll. Many babies don’t, and they get to
sleep just fine.
One trick with your baby’s lovie is to rub it against your own skin
before putting it in the crib. This idea sounds gross, but leaving a
little eau-de-you on the lovie can make it even more comforting at
nighttime.
Chapter 5: Getting the Hang of It: Sleep from 6 to 12 Months 83

Parents tend to have a love-hate relationship with one particular
lovie, the pacifier. Babies who fall asleep while sucking on one may
be at a loss when they can’t locate it in the middle of the night;
then, of course, they scream for help — a particularly vexing prob-
lem between 4 and 8 months of age. (After that, they seem to
employ baby sonar and find the hidden prize themselves.)
To avoid the middle-of-the-night pacifier hunt, try trading it for
another lovie like a doll or blanket and see whether your baby
accepts the switch. However, keep in mind that recent studies 
suggest that pacifiers can help protect against sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS). (For more information on pacifiers in general and
preventing SIDS in particular, see Chapter 4.)
A note about naps at this age
For a weary parent, a baby’s nap is like a life preserver to a drown-
ing person. Babies’ naps provide the crucial breaks parents need
to relax and recharge — and, of course, to read great parenting
books. Naps typically take place in the middle of the morning or
the middle of the afternoon.
Children between 6 and 12 months of age typically sleep 10 to 12
hours at night and take two naps that last about an hour each.
(Naps may taper off to just one toward the end of the year.) Of
course, that’s the average amount of sleep — and as everybody
knows, no one has an average child! In reality, sleep needs can vary
a great deal, and you have little control over the total number of
hours your baby needs each 24 hours.
The good news is that you can use the same strategies for naps
that you use for nighttime (check the earlier sections of this chap-
ter for a review of these strategies). Consistency is the ticket. In
addition, these tips can promote a peaceful naptime:
 Timing: Stick as closely to a schedule as you can, but you
don’t need to bring your life to a screeching halt in order to
put your baby down at exactly the same times each day.
Consider these tips:
• Plan a nap for half an hour after lunch or a snack to
ensure that your baby’s tummy is full; this helps her
sleep more soundly.
• Move naptime up a bit if you notice that your darling is
getting drowsy a little ahead of schedule. Otherwise she’s
likely to get overtired and be too wound up to sleep.
• Time your baby’s second nap for early afternoon to give
her plenty of time to get sleepy again before bedtime.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
84

 Sounds: Keep the noise level in your house low during 
naptime and put some soft music on in the background.
 Lighting: Consider buying blackout shades for the nursery
because young babies sleep better in a dark room.
 Toys: When your tot reaches the 12-month mark and crib toys
are no longer taboo, place some safe toys in the crib. They
can buy you a few precious minutes of peace and quiet by
amusing your baby when she first opens her eyes.
No matter how inviting you make naptime, be ready for an occa-
sional struggle. At bedtime, you hold all the cards because biology
eventually forces your baby to fall asleep — even if it seems to take
forever. At naptime, however, your baby has an ace hidden in her
diaper; she’s physically capable of refusing to fall asleep. To her,
the world has such exciting appeal that she may very well insist on
staying awake, no matter how cranky she gets.
However, you don’t need to give in completely. Even if you can’t make
your baby fall asleep, you can place her in her crib and keep her
there. She may fuss the first few times you do this, but she eventually
takes the hint — and gives you a much-needed hour or so of freedom.
Identifying and Combating
Difficulties due to Milestones
Developmental milestones can have a big effect on your baby’s
sleep. Think of each developmental surge as a huge ocean wave
coming up behind you. As you sense the water coming, you tense
up to brace yourself for the wave. When babies are nearing a big
milestone, they too sense the tension, and this tension often spills
over into the sleep cycle.
Sitting up, crawling, and pulling up to a stand are perhaps the most
common developmental leaps that change sleepytime. Sometimes, a
tot is so excited by a new skill that he can’t sleep. Other times, a tyke
learns a new skill like sitting or standing up in his crib but hasn’t mas-
tered the fine art of getting back down; he squawks for help because
he wants to plop back down on his bed but can’t figure out how. (For
ways to help a tot who gets stuck this way, see Chapter 6.)
You may find it interesting to keep a chart of your child’s sleep-cycle
fluctuations to see whether the disruptions precede the appearance
of a new skill. Of course, this charting can’t make any difference in
your child’s sleep, but your understanding of this temporary change
can be comforting to you. Typically, sleep returns to normal after
your baby masters the new skill.
Chapter 5: Getting the Hang of It: Sleep from 6 to 12 Months 85

To chart your baby’s sleep, simply use the forms in the appendix 
of this book to record the number of hours that your baby sleeps
each night and nap. Then look for patterns. For instance, five good
nights of sleep followed by four crabby nights or three missed
afternoon naps in a row may be signaling a big change like learning
to sit up or crawl. Charting can also help you spot trends and see
how well your sleep strategies are working.
Figure 5-2 shows an example of a completed two-week hour-by-
hour sleep log of a 10-month-old who learned to pull himself to
standing at the beginning of Week Two. You can see how this sleep
log highlights the pattern: His picture-perfect sleep routine briefly
turns to chaos before settling down again. The parent of this tot
can use this data to figure out what happened during that brief
wild ride — for instance, company arriving, a major developmental
milestone, a flu bug, or a change in sitters.
We provide a blank daily sleep log for you in the appendix.

magine how it feels to master a new skill every few weeks. In
your adult world, that’s like becoming an expert guitar player,
great golfer, and gourmet cook — all in a couple of months. And
that’s what life is like now for your child, who’s mastering amazing
skills at a rapid rate. What an exciting time the second year of life
is for your little one!
Two of the biggest skills are crawling and walking. Although there’s
plenty of variation, most children start crawling around 9 months
of age and graduate to walking near the 1-year mark. These transi-
tions lead to some big psychological changes that typically kick in
shortly after the 12-month milestone.
Crawling and walking are important events because they expand
your child’s physical and mental horizons. But they also affect
your little one’s daytime and nighttime sleep. So just when you
thought you were home free, you may be faced with the sleepless
nights that haunted you during your baby’s first few months.
In addition to the crawling, standing, and walking, a problem called
separation anxiety can wreak havoc on your little one’s sleep.
Luckily, sleep problems at this stage tend to be temporary, but in
this chapter we show how you can handle them with a few tried-
and-true techniques. We also talk about standing in the crib, why it
can be a problem for a toddler, and how you can help your baby
quickly solve it.

Gaining Independence: The 
Joy — and the Scare!
In addition to the heady feeling your 1-year-old gets from beginning
to make big decisions (which toys to grab, what sights to explore),
his new freedom has another side: He realizes he can move away
from you . . . and you can leave him. Up to now he’s viewed you as a
permanent fixture, sort of like the sofa or the coffee table. But now
he knows that — unlike the furniture — you can take off for parts
unknown. Initially, it’s alarming news, and he responds to impend-
ing separations by clinging to your leg like a suckerfish, weeping . . .
well, like a baby, or even throwing full-fledged hissy fits.
Your child’s panicky responses to your departures — a reaction
that child psychologists call separation anxiety — is actually a
normal developmental milestone. In fact, it shows that your tod-
dler is gaining these important new skills:
 He sees the difference between familiar people and strangers.
 He realizes how very important you are in his life.
 He has the awareness to anticipate the sad feeling of missing
you when you’re gone.
However, he can’t understand that partings are temporary, so he
sees them, even at bedtime, as threatening.
Parting is such sweet sorrow: The
beginning of separation anxiety
You can’t predict when separation anxiety will enter the picture,
but it’s a natural outgrowth of object permanence, the knowledge
that you don’t just vanish when you’re out of sight. Object perma-
nence usually develops around 8 months of age, and separation
anxiety arrives on the scene a bit later, typically between 12 and 20
months. Separation anxiety slowly fades as your child understands
that you come back after each parting.
When separation anxiety takes center stage, your child — even 
if she’s always been a people person — suddenly balks when 
you introduce her to strangers. The arrival of a sitter (even a 
familiar one) is also likely to trigger tears or tantrums. And
because the line between friend and stranger is still a little 
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
88

blurry to your angel, even Grandma and Grandpa may suddenly
get the cold shoulder.
Each child reacts to separation anxiety in a unique way. Some kids
can barely let their parents out of sight, and other toddlers breeze
through this stage with only occasional clinginess. Personality
plays a big role in how children deal with the partings. Shy tots
often suffer the most, but even the most carefree and outgoing
tykes can surprise their parents by developing a raging case of 
separation anxiety. Major life changes, such as a move or the
arrival of a sibling, can also trigger an intense fear of separation
from Mom or Dad.
Understanding why separation 
anxiety affects sleep
When separation anxiety issues crop up, sleep problems are often
part of the package because sleep is a very big separation for your
toddler. At this stage he can anticipate how he’ll feel when he’s all
alone in his crib, and he lets you know — at the top of his lungs —
that he’s not looking forward to your absence.
The message he’s sending with these blood-curdling shrieks is that
he’s powerfully attached to you and counts on you to keep him
safe and secure. Realizing that your baby has such a strong bond
with you can give you the warm fuzzies. But that warm feeling
quickly turns to heartburn when you realize it’s back . . . the nightly
bedtime struggle.
Taking Back the Night: Battling
Common Sleep Struggles
Your child’s developmental road may seem a bit bumpy right now
because she’s literally taking two steps forward and then plopping
down on her bottom. The same is true for her psychological devel-
opment. The more she understands, the more she thinks about
even the simplest tasks. Your tot’s consternation can lead to some
rough nights and tough decisions for you, too, as you adapt to her
growing needs and desires.
You can’t avoid these developmental growth spurts (and you don’t
want to!), so this section offers some strategies that can help your
toddler chill out.
Chapter 6: Baby on the Move: Sleep from 12 to 18 Months 89

Relieving nighttime 
separation anxiety
Routine is particularly important to children mastering the exciting
but potentially scary skill of separating from their parents because
predictable patterns ease their anxieties at this stressful stage.
This means toddlers thrive on consistency, so if you didn’t estab-
lish a routine during the second half of your child’s first year (see
our advice in Chapter 5), now’s a good time to create one and stick
to it.
Although you want predictability, your bedtime rituals also need to
reflect your child’s changes. This flexibility means that the books
you read, the songs you sing, or your child’s pre-bedtime snack will
change. However, if your general routine is firmly established, the
small tweaks you make won’t interfere with the bedtime process.
When you spot the first signs of separation anxiety, put all the
pieces of your sleepy-time drill back in place (we explain the
basics of the routine in Chapter 5). In this section we add some
new components and modifications now that your child is older.
 Stick to a script. Take advantage of your child’s growing verbal
skills when you’re preparing him for bedtime or other transi-
tion times. Using short, clear sentences (think of Jane talking
to Tarzan), say the same words to your baby each night as
bedtime approaches. For instance, a few minutes before your
targeted bedtime, you can say, “Look at the clock — it’s almost
time for bed!” Your child can understand a surprising amount
of this message, and he’ll find the repetition reassuring.
 Keep the bath solo. At this age, a warm bath is a wonderful
way to usher in the sandman. However, if you have more than
one child, avoid popping everybody in the tub together. Two
or more kids in a bathtub full of toys, suds, and water is not a
recipe for relaxation for anyone! If separate baths are impossi-
ble to fit in every night, let the cleanest kid skip a day.
 Cuddle up with a book. Even though you add new books as
your child ages, keep going back to the originals — especially
during stressful times like the separation-anxiety phase.
 Resist the urge to fudge on bedtime. Keeping a child up just a
little longer can be very tempting (especially if Mommy or
Daddy gets home from work late), but this switch only over-
stimulates your wee one and disrupts the bedtime routine.
Instead, try to schedule family time for a few extra minutes in
the morning, after everyone’s had a good night’s sleep.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
90

 Let Teddy take the night shift. Now that your sweetie is past
the 1-year mark, he can safely take a doll or stuffed animal to
bed (see the safety tips at the end of this chapter). You can
make this lovie a part of the bedtime ritual. For instance, have
Teddy join you during story time and then tuck him in and tell
him “Night-night” too.
Squelching separation anxiety 
while the sun is up
Leftover stress from a hectic day can cause anyone to toss and
turn, and that’s just as true for little people as it is for grownups. 
If you want to avoid fussy nights, try smoothing your child’s path
during the daytime hours, particularly when separation anxiety
reaches its peak.
Powering up predictability
One key to achieving peace and quiet is to keep changes to a 
minimum. The following tips can help you minimize your baby’s
daytime stress:
 At home, let your child approach strangers, friends, and rela-
tives on her own terms. This stage is definitely not the time to
scoop her up and say, “Give Nana a big kiss!” (unless Nana
handles rejection well). Instead, let your child observe people
quietly; let her decide when she’s ready to be more friendly.
 Try to stick to consistent nap times; prepare your little angel for
naps by offering quiet games, lullabies, a story, and a cuddle.
 If possible, avoid switching sitters or day care during this time
in your child’s life.
 If you need to leave an anxious toddler with a friend or sitter,
be sure to make your parting cheerful. Say “Bye-bye, I’ll see
you soon,” offer a quick kiss, and scoot. Even if you’re nerv-
ous about parting from your sweetie, don’t let your smile slip
until you’re safely out of sight.
 If you have a choice, don’t take an extended vacation away
from your child during this time in her life. A toddler’s sense
of time is vague, and even a long weekend can seem like eter-
nity. You may have earned a little time off, but the price tag —
in terms of sleepless nights — can be awfully steep.
Making a conscientious preschool decision
To help ease your child’s separation anxiety, hold off preschool until
your little one is closer to 2 — when her verbal skills and her under-
standing that you do come back can help her cope. Children under 3
Chapter 6: Baby on the Move: Sleep from 12 to 18 Months 91

often react strongly to being separated from a beloved caregiver. 
But if preschool is a necessity, a tot over 2 can make this transition
with only temporary fussing. You can ease the way by choosing a
preschool that allows time for your child to transition slowly. This
means you get to stay with your little darling until she feels comfort-
able with her teachers and new surroundings. For more information
on sleep solutions involving day care, flip ahead to Chapter 11.
Dealing with setbacks 
in your routine
Even if your bedtime routine is polished to perfection, it isn’t
always enough. Lots of big and little adjustments — a change in
babysitters or a new tooth coming in — can cause a bump in the
road, and sometimes you feel like you’ve made a U-turn. When this
problem occurs, take a step back and reintroduce some of the
strategies we outline in Chapter 5.
Giving Baby a refresher course: Revisiting the basics
If your little one is backsliding, get firm about your bedtime drill so
you can get the basics back in place:
 When your child cries or bangs on the crib rails as you
leave the room, calmly say, “I love you. It’s bedtime, and I
will see you in the morning.” Then calmly and cheerfully
walk out and close the door.
 Be prepared for your baby to cry probably 30 to 60 minutes.
Your child is disappointed but not traumatized; he wants you
but doesn’t need you. (See Chapter 3 for an explanation of
these very important distinctions.) Try — really, really try! —
to resist the urge to go back into his room even if he uses
those new power words: “Mama!” and “Dada!”
 If you can’t stop yourself, then go in briefly, pat him on the
back, tell him once again that you love him, and say you’ll
see him in the morning.
Don’t be too hard on yourself if you give in and pay him a
visit. But remember, every time your sweetie wins the game,
he wants to win again. He’s like a gambler in Vegas, and you’re
the payoff that keeps him pulling the lever.
Striking a compromise at midnight
If your child falls asleep but then wakes during the night, you 
really want to have a plan in place (after all, who wants to start
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
92

deep-thinking at midnight!). Here are some strategies that can help
you compromise between tough love and all-out surrender.
 Keep it simple. Analyze your baby’s cries and decide whether
he’s really in need or just seeking attention. If you’re sure it’s
nothing serious, steel yourself to wait him out.
This stall technique gives you (and your little Paul Revere) 
a chance to find out whether he can get back to sleep on his
own. Giving him a chance to cry it out and comfort himself 
is the best approach, but it’s definitely hard to do. If you
absolutely must go into his room, give him a quick pat and a
reassuring word, and then leave. Don’t pick him up, or you’ll
signal playtime. (Yikes!)
 Keep your cool. If several minutes seem like several hours
and you can’t fight the desire to comfort your little howler,
strike a deal with your softer side:
• If you hear your little one sobbing around midnight, tell
yourself: “It’s 12:02 now. If he’s still screaming at 12:15,
I’ll go in.”
• At 12:15, re-evaluate his cries. If they’re just as loud 
or louder and you can’t take any more, go to him.
However, if you sense that he’s winding down, set
another target time and see whether he falls asleep
before that new time.
 Keep increasing the intervals. If he wakes you up again and
again, make him wait a little longer each time. If you wait 10
minutes the first time, make it 20 the next, and so on. Parents
who use this technique often find that about 45 minutes is the
longest they can wait until going in. However, after going in
three or four times in ever-lengthening intervals, you may just
want to say, “That’s all, folks” and not go in until morning —
even if your pride and joy cries for another hour.
This technique makes Mom and Dad feel better, but it takes
longer than if you stay out of your tot’s room altogether. If the
slower plan’s okay with you and your family, then it’s a work-
able compromise.
Stick to this drill each time problems arise in the middle of the
night so you can nip those buggers in the bud. Over time, your
child’s wake-up calls will become fewer and farther between — 
and you’ll gain more confidence as you discover that setting limits
works for both of you.

When Problems Stick Around:
Monitoring Your Child’s 
Sleep Patterns
The combination of separation anxiety, big new skills like 
walking and talking, and more independence can make sleep 
issues harder than ever to sort out at this stage. To help make
sense of the chaos, try replacing your hour-by-hour sleep chart
with the version in Table 6-1, which allows you to track clues like
life changes, the effects of new people in your tot’s life, and major
milestones.

Three More Steps to Success:
Safety, Naps, and Substitutes
When you’ve fine-tuned your bedtime drill and handled separation
anxiety, your nights should be full of sweet dreams again. But
you’re not quite done until you take three more steps to ensure a
safe and quiet sleepytime for everyone: Update your safety rules;
adjust those naps, and offer age-appropriate lovies and soothing
substitutes for Mommy or Daddy.
Safety check: Mattress down,
bumpers out, lovie in!
Young toddlers have a powerful case of wanderlust, so make sure
your little explorer can’t find a way to get into trouble during the
night. When he reaches the standing stage, be sure to lower the
crib mattress so his head comes just above the crib rail when he’s
standing. This height keeps him from pulling himself up and over
the top rail and taking a nasty tumble. Also, if you haven’t already
removed the bumpers in the crib, take them out now so they don’t
give him a leg up . . . and out.
Note: Excellent news on the safety front! The risk of sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS) is incredibly small after the first year, so you
can breathe a sigh of relief and put your little one’s beloved blankie
or stuffed monkey in the crib with him. Just make sure the toys
don’t have hard edges and — of course — are safe for children
under 2 years old. (Also make sure his toys don’t have loose parts
he can put in his mouth or any holes where stuffing can fall out.)
Morphing two naps into one
Sometime during the second year of life, most kiddies begin to give
up their morning snooze in favor of a longer afternoon nap. As you
can probably guess, this change doesn’t happen suddenly — and it
may require some work from you!
The first clue is when your toddler resists going down for her nap
in the morning or holds out until late morning and then doesn’t
sleep well in the afternoon. These are signs that your baby’s world
is changing; she’s now able to stay alert for longer periods, taking
in all the new sight and sounds. You may miss that morning break
(perfect for a quick shower) at first, but you soon realize that a
longer afternoon nap gives you and your angel a much-needed
respite from a busy day.
Chapter 6: Baby on the Move: Sleep from 12 to 18 Months 95

Some toddlers figure out this switch all by themselves, but most
need a little help:
 Lots of babies seem to want to nod off right at lunchtime —
it’s not uncommon to find a young toddler asleep with her
head resting in her macaroni and cheese! To avoid this, feed
your toddler a bit earlier, moving up the schedule by 15 or 30
minutes (although some kids don’t eat as well because break-
fast is still a vivid memory). If you don’t feed her before the
nap, her tummy wakes her up and she can’t sleep as long as
she should.
 As your child grows, try to feed her later and later until her
lunch occurs at more convenient times. Give her a little break
before beddy-bye so nature can take its course (diaper-wise,
that is) and her tummy can settle down.
 Some parents find that a child is so ready for an afternoon 
nap that she sleeps for more than two hours. Figure out how
much sleep your child needs, and if a lengthy nap doesn’t
interfere with a regular bedtime — go for it. But you may find
that you need to wake your sleeping beauty to insure a decent
bedtime hour.
Updating your lovies for 
a separation-shy sweetie
In Chapter 5, we talk about transitional objects or lovies — items
like photos or articles of clothing that remind your cherub of you
when you’re not around. These can be powerful tools during the
separation anxiety stage, and you can be more creative now that
your angel’s a little older.
For instance, some parents buy nontoxic ink stamps and make a
little design — a butterfly, flower, or dinosaur, for example — on
their little one’s arm and say, “That’s right where I’ll give you a big
kiss when I pick you up today.” This idea’s great because, unlike
lovies, an ink stamp can’t get lost (put the stamp where it can’t
wash off —not on a hand!). Let your child pick different stamps 
to add to the fun — and maybe let her put a stamp on you, too.

f toddlers had an official motto as their second birthday
approached, it’d be: “Watch out world, here I am — but where
am I!?” After spending their first year and a half in a cocoon of con-
tentment with every need met by Mommy or Daddy, they’re now at
a new level of awareness. Like butterflies, they’re emerging to see
their world in different ways.
Not surprisingly, this big transition and the many other physical
and mental changes of this age (like giving up the nighttime bottle
and moving from crib to big bed, which we discuss near the end of
this chapter) can affect your tot’s sleep cycle in new and interest-
ing ways. In this chapter, we also talk about some common sleep
problems that occur around this time: nightmares, night terrors,
sleep-talking and sleepwalking. In addition, we describe two alarm-
ing but generally harmless bedtime behaviors: rocking and head-
banging. (No, it’s not a toddler rave — just a normal stage!) We also
take a quick look at tooth-grinding, an annoying but usually tempo-
rary issue.

Underlying Changes for 
the 11⁄2-Year-Old
The age of 11⁄2 is a time of big changes. Your 12-month-old and your
20-month-old may look about the same on the outside, but inside
it’s a different story.
Only adolescence creates so dramatic a change, and parents usu-
ally know what to expect (and dread!) when puberty hits. The great
changes that take place in an 18-month old tot, however, usually
take families by surprise. So, knowing what to expect can keep you
a step ahead of the game — especially when sleep’s at stake.
Expanding awareness
Consciousness — call it the awareness of awareness — is the most
remarkable aspect of being human, and it begins at this age. Before
this point, your baby was aware of a hungry tummy or a wet diaper,
but now she realizes that she’s aware. She’s developing a life of the
mind, which means she can ponder big questions like “What am I
really hungry for?” This is a major milestone — the biggest one
since birth.
The power of this new consciousness is also its challenge. For the
rest of your child’s life, every situation will be an opportunity to
think, “How can this be better?” Your well-established sleep rou-
tines, for example, become targets when she realizes that bedtime
doesn’t have to be the way it always was.
Awakening desire and imagination
Before now, your child was pretty satisfied with life. Now, however,
his eyes are open to the rich and exciting world around him, and that
awareness feeds a growing imagination and a powerful new emotion:
desire. But he doesn’t know how to make sense of these feelings or
express them in words because of his limited communication skills.
Take a look at these three feelings and how they set up new 
challenges:
 The budding imagination: Imagination is the ability to form a
mental image of something that isn’t actually present. Your
toddler is no longer always content with the toy in his hand,
the storybook on the couch, or the box of cookies in the
kitchen.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
98

 The power of desire: This little person realizes a whole lot of
wonderful and amazing stuff is out there, and he wants it all —
now, now, now. This flood of desire can be simply overwhelming,
especially the new and gnawing feeling that the here-and-now
isn’t good enough. He knows that he wants something to be dif-
ferent, but he’s not sure exactly what he wants or how to get it.
 Limited communication skills: In time, as your toddler’s vocab-
ulary grows, he’ll more easily describe his thoughts and long-
ings. But not at 18 months of age! Right now, he’s a bundle of
fiery desires that he can’t explain — either to himself or to you.
That’s why you’re getting the first glimpses of the terrible twos
that are just around the corner.
These overwhelming feelings lead to some pretty heavy sleep dis-
turbances, which we cover in the next section. They explain why
you’re encountering some new sleep issues at this age, too.
What to Expect from the Active
Mind during Sleepy Time
Once upon a time (in fact, just a few weeks ago), your baby
snoozed without much drama. The path to dreamland was a little
rocky, but when she got there, your sweetie slept contentedly. Now
she’s changing, and her new awareness and imagination can turn
the once-peaceful Land of Nod into wild terrain.
At this stage, several behaviors you may have spotted in earlier
months can become more frequent or intense. They include:
 Rocking and head-banging before sleep
 Tooth-grinding during sleep
 Nightmares and night terrors
 Sleepwalking and sleep-talking
Some of these behaviors seem a little scary, but in the toddler years,
nighttime thrills and chills are almost always normal. As long as
your toddler is happy and well-adjusted during the daytime, you
don’t need to worry about her or feel guilty — the vast majority of
these problems have nothing to do with home, school, or you.
If you want to get a good handle on the hows and whys of the sleep
events we discuss in the next sections, we recommend you check
out Chapter 2 first. Then again, if you’d rather cut to the chase and
get some quick answers on how to cope with each behavior, read on.
Chapter 7: The Wake-Up Call: Sleep from 18 Months to 2 Years 99

A whole lotta shakin’ goin’ on!
Rocking and head-banging
Finding your little angel whacking his head against the crib bars or
headboard a little after tuck-in time can be scary. But don’t panic 
if this happens — both head-banging and its close cousin, crib-
rocking, are common and normal behaviors in this age range. In
fact, about one in six toddlers rocks or head-bangs. Note: The
actions can appear earlier or later than the age of 18 months, but
they tend to fade away by the age of two.
The explanation for rocking and head-banging is simple: Both actions
actually have a calming effect. There’s a world of difference between
the exciting, action-packed daytime hours of a toddler and the quiet
state of just lying there. For some little nippers, this is a way to dis-
charge their batteries so they can snuggle down for the night.
Both behaviors can be very alarming to parents, who typically ask
four questions. We cover these questions in the following list, along
with our answers and explanations:
 Can my child hurt himself when he head-bangs? No. Rocking
and even head-banging stop far short of causing harm.
Protecting those little noggins is very important, but head-
banging in the bed doesn’t hurt them.
 Is he doing it because he’s upset about something? If your
child seems happy and well-adjusted during the day, then no,
rocking and head-banging aren’t signs of emotional troubles.
However, if your toddler does seem unhappy or distressed
during waking hours, be sure to talk to his pediatrician. The
point of concern is the daytime issues, not the rocking and
head-banging in bed.
 Is this an early warning that something may be wrong with
him? Rocking and head-banging can raise a parent’s fears that
a child has developmental issues, but the deciding factor is
the quality of interaction during the day, not the rocking and
head-banging before bedtime.
 Should parents do something to stop a toddler from head-
banging in the bed? The answer is No for two very good rea-
sons. One: You can’t do much to stop this behavior. Two: No
harm is being done, so why stop it?
If your toddler is sociable, makes eye contact easily, responds
when you talk to him, and is pretty much on track with major
development milestones, then don’t waste time worrying
about these common-as-dirt bedtime behaviors.

The tooth fairy’s pet peeve: 
Grinding the chompers
The sound of a toddler grinding her teeth in her sleep (also called
bruxism) is like fingernails on a chalkboard — only worse, because
it raises the fear that she’ll wear her pearly whites down to a nubbin.
Fortunately, these worries are groundless. As it turns out, tooth-
grinding is a normal and harmless behavior at this age.
Doctors don’t really have a clue why some tots grind their teeth
and others don’t. Some experts guess that it has something to do
with moving the teeth into good position, and others think it’s a
way to express feelings.
Roughly one in five children is a tooth-grinder, but the behavior
tends to disappear as children grow beyond early childhood. In
adults or older children, it’s cause for some worry — but for tod-
dlers, it’s no big deal.
If you’re worried about damage to your child’s teeth, ask her den-
tist to check whether the enamel is wearing down or whether the
teeth have any chips or cracks. Also, ask your child whether her
jaw hurts. Most likely, neither the dentist nor your child will report
any problems.
Our suggestion? Reassure yourself that this behavior, although
rough on your ears, isn’t hurting your toddler’s teeth at all. Cross
this worry off your list . . . and pop on your MP3 player so you
don’t have to hear that awful noise!
Different problems, different cures:
Nightmares and night terrors
You hear blood-curdling shrieks at 3 a.m., leap out of bed, and race
to your toddler’s bedside. He’s sitting up in bed, screaming hysteri-
cally, and you wonder, “What can I do to help?”
This question has two answers, and to pick the right one, you need
to know which scenario you’re viewing. Is it a nightmare or a night
terror? They look and sound alike, but they’re actually as different
as night and day — and so are the strategies for dealing with them.
In the next few sections, we explain why.
Chapter 7: The Wake-Up Call: Sleep from 18 Months to 2 Years 101

Nightmares: The dark side of dreaming
In Chapter 2, we talk about rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, the
stage in which people have vivid dreams. A nightmare is just a
dream, but one loaded with bad feelings like fear and sadness. Like
any other dream, it has two interesting features:
 It feels completely real.
 People often remember it after waking up.
In fact, dreams (both good and bad) appear to be all about memory.
Dreams are created from the building blocks of our waking memo-
ries; in turn, they create their own memories that can carry over
into the day. But bad memories have added punch because
 Fear and sadness are so terribly powerful. Life holds many
joys, but hurt and loss are realities as well. Unfortunately, as
consciousness awakens at age 18 months, so does a tot’s
awareness of what can go wrong. That adds some scary new
plotlines to your tot’s bad dreams.
 The nightmares of young children can be even bigger and
scarier than an adult’s. At this age, toddlers become conscious
of the world’s dangers — people get hurt, flowers die, Mommy
and Daddy can get sick. As a result, a child’s bad memories
are often very vivid. Even the happiest little tykes head off to
bed with heavy baggage (memories) of real and imagined wor-
ries, and those worries can wind up in their dreams.
What can you do when your child wakes up screaming after a bad
dream? Remember these suggestions:
1. Make sure he’s really in the grip of a nightmare and not a
night terror (see the next section).
If it’s a nightmare, he’ll be awake but will try to figure out
which world is real — the realm of nightmares or his safe
bedroom.
2. Help him get back to reality by calming him, talking to
him about how nightmares aren’t real, and staying with
him until he knows that everything’s hunky-dory.
Your touch, your voice, the sight of your face, and even
your familiar aroma all help him get over his big scare.
Night terrors: The wild ride of deep sleep
Night terrors are one of the most alarming events a parent can wit-
ness, but they’re also perfectly normal — a fact that may reassure
a mom or dad who’s watching the scary episode. They occur most
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
102

often in children between the ages of 11⁄2 and 3, and affect as many
as 5 percent of tots in this age range.
To understand night terrors, you need to know how their underly-
ing causes and symptoms differ from nightmares:
 When they occur: Night terrors strike during sleep arousals —
brief moments of awareness during deep sleep, the Stage 4 we
discuss in Chapter 2. Nightmares, on the other hand, occur at
the edge of waking during REM sleep.
 How they affect your toddler’s actions while sleeping: Night
terrors allow a sleeper’s body to act as if he’s awake; during
nightmares, however, a person’s body doesn’t move.
A toddler in the grip of a night terror can act out the drama
that’s going on in his sound-asleep brain. For instance, he may
jump up and down in his crib and howl at the top of his lungs.
 How they affect the ability to wake up: The child who’s
having a night terror is sound asleep and often virtually
impossible to awaken (due to being in Stage 4 sleep), but a
parent can rouse a tot from a nightmare — and a bad dream
may even jolt him right out of sleep.
 How they affect your toddler’s waking life: People with night
terrors often have no awareness or memory of the event, but
nightmares are frequently remembered.
Chapter 7: The Wake-Up Call: Sleep from 18 Months to 2 Years 103
To sleep, perchance to dream . . . but why?
When we dream, our brains create scenarios that feel like flesh-and-blood events.
But what’s the point of this? What possible benefit is there to winning the lottery or
sinking a three-pointer in the NBA finals if it’s only happening in our imagination?
Freud, that most famous of dream analysts, believed that dreams allow our brains
to break free from the rules and restrictions of our wide-awake hours so we can
experience life without limits. In the process, he speculated, we get the chance to
try out different approaches to challenges without the trouble that real-life deci-
sions can cause.
A very different theory derives from modern neuroscience, which proposes that
dreams help to repair the wear-and-tear that daily life inflicts on our brains.
According to this line of thought, dreams build or repair the circuits that allow us to
remember the important life-lessons of each day. If this theory is true, then dreams
give our brains a chance to have dress rehearsals, allowing our memories to get
firmly established. And in the case of toddlers, who are building thousands of new
brain circuits each minute, establishing these memories is a very important job!

If you mistake a night terror for a nightmare, you expect your
screaming toddler to leap into your arms for comfort when you
reach his bedside. In reality, however, he has no clue that you’re
there, even if his eyes are wide open and you’re standing right in
front of him! This situation is highly distressing to a loving parent
trying to rescue a toddler from a terrifying event.
In a night terror, your child is just as asleep as when he’s dozing
blissfully. As a result, your reassuring words and hugs have
absolutely zero effect.
So what should you do about your shrieking, crib-rattling, can’t-be-
woken-up toddler? Our recommendation is that you do nothing at
all for the following reasons:
 You can’t rouse your sweetie during a night terror.
 In a short while, the episode ends, and your little one snug-
gles right back down to snooze peacefully once again.
 In the morning, when you’re bleary-eyed, he won’t have a clue
that anything happened at all. Night terrors typically leave no
trace when they’re over.
When you recognize a night terror for what it really is, you’ll be
able to relax even if your little bedbug is screaming bloody murder.
You’ll know that this is a harmless phenomenon of very deep
sleep, and it doesn’t carry over into waking.
The only exception to the do-nothing plan involves children who
have regular night terrors about the same time nearly every night.
If that’s the case in your household, you can try disrupting the
sleep cycle by waking your little one up half an hour or an hour
before the night-terror hour rolls around.
Variations on a theme: Sleepwalking
and sleep-talking
It’s the basis of many favorite stories: Mom or Dad hears a funny
noise in the night and wanders out to see Junior raiding the refrig-
erator or pooping on the potty while totally asleep. In other ver-
sions, parents find their little tykes mumbling away in their sleep
or even speaking in sentences.
These behaviors, known as sleepwalking and sleep-talking, occur
during sleep arousals, just like the night terrors we discuss in the
previous section. During these arousals, toddlers’ brains are sound
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
104

asleep, but their bodies can still move — and sometimes take off
on their own adventures in the middle of the night.
Sleep-talking is very common — about 1⁄3 of toddlers do it — and it’s
even more common as children reach the preteen years. Sleepwalk-
ing, on the other hand, is rarer, affecting about 1⁄10 of children by
age 10. Neither behavior is a reason for concern as long as you can
keep a sleepwalker safely corralled.
Knowing how long these disturbances last
Many sleepwalking episodes and nearly all bouts of sleep-talking
are brief. For instance, your little cuddle-bunny may murmur a few
syllables of gibberish while snoozing or stand up next to the bed
for just a few seconds before keeling over again.
In some cases, toddlers’ sleep-talking or sleepwalking episodes last
for several minutes. Sleepwalking toddlers may perform several
very complex steps and then do something totally off-the-wall. For
example, a child may get out of bed with a purposeful expression,
walk confidently to the closet, pull down her pants, pee on the
floor, and march efficiently back to bed.
Reacting appropriately
If your little sweet cake is a sleep-talker, don’t bother trying to
translate what she’s saying. Sleep-talking, far from being a child’s
attempt to communicate some form of deeply felt emotion, is typi-
cally just meaningless strings of nonsense. The old belief that
sleep-talking offers a window into the soul is baseless unless your
child’s soul is trying to say, “Wubba tubba gicky boo!”
The dangers of sleepwalking, on the other hand, are no laughing
matter and neither is the distress it can cause for parents. When a
little sleepwalker starts to take some steps, all sorts of trouble can
occur. Many parents, for instance, tell horror stories about their
tots opening the front door and going for a stroll around the neigh-
borhood in their jammies. A single, brief episode of sleepwalking
isn’t anything to worry about, however — so just keep the follow-
ing tips in mind:
 Don’t try waking your child when she’s sleepwalking. Just
as with night terrors, she’s in very deep sleep and is nearly
impossible to arouse. If she doesn’t resist, you can gently
steer her back to bed — but don’t try to force the issue.
 Don’t discuss your child’s sleepwalking with her when she’s
awake. She has no control over it and typically will have no
memory of it when she awakens, so you’ll simply worry her
and make it harder for her to get to sleep.
Chapter 7: The Wake-Up Call: Sleep from 18 Months to 2 Years 105

If sleepwalking is a habit for your toddler, see the next section for
our advice.
Keeping a sleepwalker safe
If you see repeat sleepwalking performances, you need to take
extra precautions to keep your little sugar plum safe. Before you
adapt your home in general, first confine your child to her bed-
room and make sure her immediate surroundings are safe:
 Put a toddler gate at the bedroom door to keep your roaming
toddler confined. The gate provides a barrier without cutting
your child off from the rest of the house and family.
 Make sure all bedroom floor coverings are slip-proof (and
washable in case of a pee incident!).
 Pad sharp corners.
 Make sure all outlets are childproof, preferably with a back
plate that blocks access by anything except a plug.
 Look at the room each night from a child’s viewpoint, and
spot everything your child may run into when moving unpre-
dictably. Move toys off the floor so she can’t trip over them,
and remove breakables from her reach.
After you’re sure the bedroom is safe, safeguard entrances
throughout the rest of your house:
 Lock doors leading to stairs and put up baby gates where
stairs don’t have doors.
 Put locks out of your toddler’s reach on exterior doors.
 Consider installing an alarm that goes off when an exterior
door opens.
Smoothing Two Important
Transitions at This Age
Between the ages of 11⁄2 and 2, toddlers begin the march toward
preschool age. Your toddler leaves more and more of his infant
ways behind as he reaches for greater maturity and independence.
Two major steps in that direction include:
 Moving away from bottles or even regular nursing to a cup.
 Moving from a crib or your bed into a big kid bed.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
106

The switch to a cup can cause a glitch in your sleepy-time routine
if your tot is accustomed to a nighttime bottle. The move to a big bed
can rock the beddy-bye boat a bit and raise important safety issues.
Saying bye-bye to the 
bedtime bottle
If your infant uses a bottle (breastfeeding parents can skip this sec-
tion), the day will come when you decide to switch from bottle to
cup. You’ll probably ditch the daytime bottles first and then the
nighttime bottle.
At this stage, the bedtime bottle is one of your child’s favorites, and
until now it’s been a big part of the bedtime ritual. So, when you’re
ready to bid it farewell, be prepared for some sleepy-time fallout.
Before you withdraw the nighttime bottle, you need to divert your
wee one’s interest in what the bottle has to offer. Simply put, you
want to make the contents of the bottle less interesting. This pre-
liminary phase guarantees that your toddler won’t be hungry when
the bottle goes bye-bye. Follow these steps:
1. Make sure your infant can drink from a cup. You don’t
want to ask your sweetie to do something she can’t do.
(See the previous section “Knowing when to give it up.”)
2. Gradually start diluting the contents of the bottle with
water. For instance, switch to 1⁄8 water for two to three
days, then to 1⁄4 water for another two to three days, and
then to a 50-50 mix of water and formula or breast milk for
two to three days.
3. Continue the dilution strategy until the bottle contains
only water. Note: We don’t recommend introducing juice
because it can cause excessive weight gain.
Now, simply wait for the right moment to stop providing the bed-
time bottle altogether — preferably a time when no other major
life-changes are occurring and your child’s sleep patterns are well
under control. (Giving up the bedtime bottle leaves a big hole in
your toddler’s nighty-night routine, so you want the other pieces of
the ritual firmly in place.) If you don’t already have a bedtime rou-
tine, see Chapter 5 for ideas on creating one.
When the nighttime bottle is gone, your child misses it, is sad or
angry for a little while, and fusses the first few nights. In response,
you can be understanding, kind, and loving — but whatever you
Chapter 7: The Wake-Up Call: Sleep from 18 Months to 2 Years 107

do, don’t give the bottle back! As an alternative, offer a cup of
water. After all, if you stay firm, this little cloudburst will pass in a
day or two.
Movin’ on up: The switch 
from crib to big bed
Just as nobody keeps drinking from a baby bottle forever, no one
stays in a crib forever. The case of cribs versus beds, however, has
a big safety issue: Jumping out of a crib can cause broken bones.
So be sure you make the change before that risk becomes reality.
In this section we help you make this switch safely and successfully.
Figuring out when to make the switch
The first priority is to make sure your toddler doesn’t get hurt. So
if your little one is bouncing around the crib, hanging on the bars
like a monkey, or — worse yet — trying to somersault over the top
rail, think about moving him from the crib to a grownup bed. And if
your toddler is actually getting out of the crib, make that move
quickly — before he takes a dangerous tumble.
On the other hand, if your toddler happily stays put in the crib
(and you’re really sure he can’t jump out), the timing is a bit more
flexible. In any case, we recommend that you begin the transition
by 18 months of age. If you choose to wait much beyond this age,
make the crib-to-bed switch before you start toilet training. The big
bed acts as a signal that your tot’s growing up and prepares him
for other big steps like using the potty.
The right timing for the crib-to-bed switch depends not just on
your toddler’s climbing ability but also on what’s happening in his
world. Two questions that can factor into your decision are
 Are you expecting a new baby who will need the crib? If the
stork will be visiting soon, move your toddler to a big bed at
least six to eight weeks before your new baby arrives. Consider
taking the crib down completely, with your child’s help, and
storing it until you’re ready for your new arrival. This way,
your child is less likely to think that he’s getting the boot just
so his new sibling can take over his territory.
 Are other big changes going on in your child’s life? Try to
make this transition during a calm time in your toddler’s life.
Leaving his secure little crib can be too much to handle if he’s
also coping with big life-changes — for instance an illness or a
move to a new house. Also hold off on the crib-to-bed move if
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
108

your child is in the middle of toilet-training. A good motto is:
One big change at a time.
Introducing the bed
When the new bed enters the picture, prepare your toddler for this
big change. Talk about how exciting it is that he’s ready for this
grownup step, and take him to the store where he can help pick
out new sheets and pillows. You can even create a picture book
about this big change (see Chapter 14 for ideas). Also, if you start
out by putting the crib mattress on the floor (see the later section
“Making the move” for this), the change is so subtle that your
sweetie may not protest at all.
Getting the room ready
When the crib is history, your toddler has free run of his room at
night. At this point, a careful safety inspection is a must! The fol-
lowing childproofing steps should already be in place when your
tot starts moving around (crawling or walking), but now’s a good
time to review them:
1. Make sure all wall sockets have secure covers — not the
little plastic ones that your child can pull out and swallow.
2. Remove any furniture that a child can knock over (or
secure it to the wall).
3. Put locks on dresser drawers so your little wanderer
can’t use them as stepping-stones.
4. Put a latch on the closet door.
5. Move drapery pulls, pictures, or mobiles out of reach.
6. Teach your child to put his toys away before bedtime so
he doesn’t trip over them if he wakes during the night.
In addition, take these steps when the crib no longer limits night-
time journeys:
 Install a door gate.
This basically converts the room to a crib and keeps your
little one from walking all over the house at night. Make sure
the gate is sturdy enough that your toddler can’t push it open.
 Add a nightlight so your little munchkin can navigate safely
in the dark.
Making the move
When you’re ready to introduce your baby to the big bed, follow
these steps for a successful transition:
Chapter 7: The Wake-Up Call: Sleep from 18 Months to 2 Years 109

1. Start with the crib-mattress-on-the-floor approach.
Starting your baby out on his crib mattress offers two big
advantages. First, he’s safe because crib mattresses are
only a few inches high; falling can’t cause injury or even
much of a scare. Second, this mattress is the one your child
knows and loves, and its familiar feel and smell reduce the
drama of this big change.
Initially, put the crib mattress on the floor for daytime naps,
and then pop it back into the crib for nighttime. When your
child gets familiar with sleeping outside the crib bars, leave
the mattress on the floor at night as well. At this point, take
down the crib. (Let your angel watch and even help a little,
so he doesn’t think it just disappeared into thin air!)
2. After your sweetie gets a good feel for his new boun-
daries, go ahead and switch the crib mattress for the 
bed mattress you plan to use long-term.
Again, simply set the new mattress flat on the floor. It’s
easy to know when to do this; just wait until your child
stays on the crib mattress without rolling off onto the floor
for a straight one to two weeks.
3. When your child seems very at ease on the new mattress
and goes for one to two weeks with no spills onto the
floor, add the box frame.
4. When your child goes for another one to two weeks with-
out falls, complete the ensemble by adding the bed frame.
Fortunately, the risk of SIDS ended completely on your tot’s first
birthday, so he can go to sleep on his back, stomach, or even his
head! Also, he can have any assortment of sheets, blankets, pil-
lows, and stuffed animals. Toddler beds can also go anywhere in
the room, so feel free to use a wall as a barrier to keep falls from
happening.
Handling free-roaming tots
A funny thing happens at the toddler stage: Parents who didn’t co-
sleep with their baby start hearing the sound of freedom — the
pitter-patter of little feet heading straight for the master bedroom.
If your toddler starts invading your territory when he transitions
from crib to bed, see Chapter 8 for ideas about helping him stay in
his own room. Another option, of course, is to scoot over and let
him join you. Whichever you decide, be consistent! If you opt to
start co-sleeping at this stage, make sure it’s your choice, not just
your toddler pulling one over on you.

The Big Tug of War: Sleep
from 2 through 3 Years
In This Chapter
 Taking a look at your child’s changing emotions
 Prepping for bedtime and your reluctant sleeper
 Saying Goodbye to naps
 Dealing with the nighttime potty and your child’s fears
O
ne stage of childhood, more than any other, calls for the
patience of a saint and nerves of steel — the phase parents
affectionately call the Terrible Twos. At this stage, your little one
isn’t really a baby any more and his new abilities are becoming
more complex each day. To him, these changes are both exciting
and disturbing. And what a toddler feels on the inside, he shows
on the outside.
Despite the strain these 12 months can cause, we like to refer to them
as tumultuous rather than terrible. As your child’s world expands in
the most exciting ways, he rides a roller coaster of emotions —
and you get to go along for the ride. As a result, both of you will
have plenty of ups and downs, but overall it’ll be a wonderful time
of growing, discovering, and maturing.
In the course of this ride, you’ll have a number of sleepless nights
as your toddler tries to cope with real and imaginary fears, gives
up naps, and handles the art of peeing and pooping in the night
hours. However, by using the tips in this chapter, you can prepare
him for these changes as you help reduce his fears and anxieties.
With luck, you’ll discover that sleep is not the impossible dream!

Getting a Glimpse of Your 
Child’s Issues at this Age
Lots of changes are going on inside your little one as she evolves
from babyhood to childhood, and her ever-growing brain is giving
her a more sophisticated outlook on life. For example, she has a
rough understanding of time, and she knows you haven’t totally
disappeared even when you’re not right next to her. In some ways
she’s like a tween — no longer a baby but not really a big kid yet.
She struggles with giving up her baby ways, not 100-percent con-
vinced that big is all it’s cracked up to be. (Diapers do seem a whole
lot more convenient than having to remember to use the potty!)
Children at this age truly understand that they’re separate from
their parents, but this awareness doesn’t make them Gandhi or
Mother Theresa. On the contrary, this age’s theme song can be
“I’ve Gotta be Me!” with the subtitle “It’s All about Me.” Although
egocentric isn’t a complimentary term for an adult, it’s a perfect
(and perfectly normal) description of a toddler.
Understanding your toddler’s 
internal tug of war
Do the following scenarios sound familiar?
 On the days you’re in a big hurry, your toddler insists on putting
his own shoes on. On other days when you have all the time in
the world, your darling lies on the floor and cries, “You do it!”
 You’re at a friend’s birthday party and your toddler clings to
you like lint. Just a few hours later at the mall, he’s slippery as
an eel.
No wonder this age gets such a bad rap! To understand this stage
of development and how it affects your toddler’s sleep habits, you
need to understand what your toddler is thinking and feeling when
he bounces from one mood to another.
Picture your child as being in a tug of war with himself. Pulling on one
side of the rope is the baby inside him, and tugging on the other is
the big boy. Eventually, the big-boy side is going to win, but right now
the momentum in this tug of war shifts from moment to moment.
This contradictory behavior can confuse and confound a parent
because adults are looking at the situations rationally — something
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
112

your toddler can’t do just yet. For example, your child may say
“No” even to something he usually likes or looks forward to. Why?
It’s his way of asserting his self and his need for independence —
while still wanting you to be in charge.
Seeing how a 2-year-old’s 
emotions affect sleep
The conflict between baby and big person affects every aspect of
your toddler’s life, and sleep is no exception. That’s why a toddler
who snoozed peacefully for months may now be popping up like a
Jack-in-the-Box each night.
But what makes a 2-year-old fight a nap when she’s so tired she can
hardly stand? (You’d love it if someone told you to go lie down!)
Here are a few insights:
 To your tot, the world is more magical than logical. This
mixture of real and not-so-real can cause mixed-up feelings
that can easily interfere with letting go and falling asleep.
 Your little one worries, too. Your toddler may understand just
enough about a situation or life change to keep her up. In tod-
dlers’ eyes, the world revolves around them — so naturally,
anything that happens in that world is due to them. If Mommy
and Daddy have a fight or Grandma gets sick, for instance,
they must be the cause. This type of thinking can easily gum
up the sleep works.
 Kids this age still see you as omnipotent and able to fix any-
thing. We know one child who was furious at her mom because
she couldn’t stop the rain! As the world becomes more logical
to your child, it can leave her feeling a bit uncertain: “How can
everything be okay if Mom and Dad really can’t make every-
thing all better all the time?” This new concern can creep into
little minds and interfere with sleep.
 Your toddler has trouble seeing the world from your point
of view. When she calls you in the middle of the night, she
fully expects you to come and fix everything. Even though
she’s smart as a whip, she doesn’t realize how disruptive her
actions are to your sleep; she just knows that she wants you
when she wants you.
 At this age, your little one is full of desires and not too
savvy about limits. If one cookie is good, then six cookies
with ice cream are even better! All the logic in the world can’t
rock this belief, and so it is with wake-up calls: She can never
have too many.
Chapter 8: The Big Tug of War: Sleep from 2 through 3 Years 113

In short, your tot is just doing her job — growing up! And 2-year-
olds, just like teens, go through a stage where contradictions,
uncontrolled desires, and negativity are perfectly normal. (Of
course, we didn’t say fun — we said normal.)
In reality, your child’s real reason for waking up and calling for you
have nothing to do with her requests. Yes, people get thirsty in the
middle of the night, and teddy bears get lost — but it’s a good bet
that your toddler wants only you and is willing to push all of your
buttons to get her wish!
If you fall into this trap, sleepytime comes later each night and
those middle-of-the-night demands become more and more insis-
tent. Even little tykes have a knack for wielding power, and when
she sees the effect that her words have on you, she’ll keep thinking
up new ways to get you out of bed. Understanding your child’s
emotional merry-go-round may give you insight into sleep issues,
but those issues shouldn’t give your angel carte blanche over the
routine. You can still be in charge of the sleep situation.
Lovingly Promoting Sleep While
Standing Your Ground
Luckily, you have some tools in your own bedtime toolbox. By using
them — firmly, lovingly, and consistently — you can put the lid on
nighttime demands and regain control of your sleepy-time routine.
Although you can’t force your child to go to sleep, you can prepare
him for bed, provide a comfortable and safe place for sleep, and
expect him to stay in his room. Achieving that last goal, of course,
is more easily said than done! But have no fear — in this section,
we tell you how to respond effectively to your little escape artist.
Preparing for bedtime with 
your toddler’s help
Bedtime is the perfect time for parents to help a child with that
internal tug of war (see the previous section). A 2-year old is
hungry to master the universe, and parents can help by tugging on
the big-kid end of the rope and leaving the baby end alone. Set up
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
114

your nighttime rituals so that your child knows exactly what to
expect and what part she plays.
Giving your child a sense of control
Children at this age love a routine so much that if you miss a step,
your tot surely points it out! Clearly defined steps each night help
wind your babe down and get her ready for sleep — both physi-
cally and emotionally. In addition, by letting your child take charge
of some bedtime routines, you give her a sense of control over it.
For instance, parents can allow a child to make a few decisions like
what to wear, which book to read, or which toothpaste to use. These
simple tasks send a powerful message: It’s time for bed, and you’re
big enough to get ready yourself! In addition, get a digital clock for
your toddler so you can step back from saying, “It’s time for bed”
and give your toddler the opportunity to tell you when sleepy-time
arrives. This technique often makes toddlers comply more easily
at tuck-in time and allows them to take another step toward inde-
pendent problem-solving — a very important life skill.
Appealing to your child’s learning style
As you help your toddler adjust to a healthy sleep schedule, con-
sider your method. Adults have a variety of learning styles, and so
do children. Some toddlers respond best to verbal cues (speech)
and follow along well if their parents talk them through the bed-
time routine. Others respond to visual cues or tactile cues (touch).
For children who are visual or tactile learners, one of the most
effective approaches is a schedule strip. Here’s how to create one:
 Make sure you have a consistent routine for bedtime:
bathing, tooth brushing, putting jammies on, reading a bed-
time story, and going to sleep.
 Break this routine into four to six parts. Then draw a pic-
ture, cut out a magazine photo, or use a photo of your own
child to represent each activity. (See example in Figure 8-1.)
 Give the strip to your child in the evening, and ask her to
tell you what activity comes next. This changes the dynamics
because she’s telling you what she does next instead of you
telling her.

Maintaining the upper hand when
your child doesn’t stay down
A big challenge in helping older toddlers get to sleep is managing
their interest in leaving their room. (See Chapter 7 for how to make
the change from crib to bed if this hasn’t happened yet.) If your tod-
dler doesn’t stay put when you tuck him in, you have several choices:
 Put up a sturdy gate, which in essence turns his entire room
into a big crib. Learn to ignore your child’s pleas to get out,
and don’t be surprised if he falls asleep on the floor instead of
in his bed for the first few days.
 If a gate doesn’t hold your little wanderer (for example, he’s
nimble enough to climb over it or can undo the latch), take
him back to his room each time he leaves and tell him that
you’ll close the door if he doesn’t stay there.
Note: This only works if he likes to sleep with the door open.
If he keeps opening the door, hold it shut, let him know that
you’re on the other side, and show him that you mean busi-
ness. Leave it open only when he’s able to stay in the room.
This ploy often works, but it may backfire if he thinks he’s
winning because you’re still close by. (When this happens,
abandon this approach.)
 Put some books and quiet toys in the room. Tell your tod-
dler, “I know you don’t feel like sleeping, but it’s bedtime and
you can play by yourself until you do feel sleepy.” Again, this
gives him a bit of control over when he falls asleep, which can
make him more cooperative.
Some families choose an entirely different route, giving their tod-
dlers access to their room and letting them sleep in the grownup
bed or in a sleeping bag or blanket on the floor. This arrangement
works if you don’t mind having your bedroom resemble a youth
hostel, but it can cause dissension in the ranks if you have a part-
ner who likes privacy. Also, if you or your partner feels a little
angry or resentful about sharing your space, your toddler is likely
to pick up on those negative vibes.
If you choose this arrangement, be prepared for your child to
remain your roommate until you take steps to change the situa-
tion. Under these circumstances, children rarely return to their
own room without a little nudge from Mom and Pop.
If your child is rapidly nearing the 3-year-old mark and he’s still in
his crib, you need to help him move to a big kid bed. Of course, as
soon as your child is capable of jumping out of a crib (even if he
Chapter 8: The Big Tug of War: Sleep from 2 through 3 Years 117

seems uninterested), safety demands a move to a bed. Check out
Chapter 7 for more on this major move.
Managing a 2-Year-Old’s
Transitions
So many changes! So little time! When your baby was a newborn,
the changes were physical and oh-so-visible. They may not be so
easy to see when your baby becomes a toddler, but they’re just as
real. Change is difficult — even for adults — so no wonder giving
up the crib or diapers can send your pumpkin into a loop-de-loop.
Choosing which transition 
comes first: Crib-to-bed or 
diapers-to-underpants?
If your toddler’s still in the crib when potty-training time arrives,
you need to figure out which change to make first. The easy answer
is to move your toddler from the crib to a bed first, because the
crib represents babyhood and potty training is a move into a more
grownup phase.
Baby books typically suggest the same progression. (In fact, that’s
why we cover the crib transition in Chapter 7.) The problem is,
however, that toddlers don’t read baby books. So you may wind up
with a toddler who’s making great progress in toilet training but
isn’t willing to leave those crib bars behind.
If your child is more interested in the potty than in having a big girl
bed, make sure her potty skills are firmly established before changing
her sleeping arrangements. Saying “Goodbye” to diapers and giving
up the crib are two big changes; doing both at the same time can be
overwhelming. Again, safety trumps all, so if she’s able to climb out
of the crib, get her out of the crib first. (See Chapter 7 for details.)
Solving nap issues: When your 
napster sings his own tune
If your little one falls asleep in the afternoon (for instance, in the car
seat coming home from the store), his little catnap can completely
disrupt his sleep at night; even a 15-minute doze can keep him
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
118

going at whirling-dervish speeds well past his usual bedtime. On
the other hand, if you keep him awake in the late afternoon, he
may fall asleep around dinner time and then be ready to party in
the middle of the night.
To help you combat these less-than-desirable situations, this sec-
tion guides you through the nap transition.
Knowing when to phase out the napping routine
Some toddlers nap right up until kindergarten, but children often
start giving up their naps between the ages of 2 and 3. This adjust-
ment is often gradual but not always easy.
In fact, at some point you’re likely to have an exhausted toddler
who ferociously battles sleep and winds up cranky as a wet mule
by the end of the day.
There’s no one right answer to when your child should give up a
nap. A child who resists napping but seems to fall apart by late
afternoon can probably benefit from a rest time (see the next sec-
tion for some ideas on how to structure one). You may want to nix
daytime dozes, however, if your child’s long afternoon nap has dis-
astrous effects on nighttime sleep, keeping him awake until 9, 10,
or later. In this case, you may be willing to put up with a cranky,
demanding toddler for a few hours in the afternoon in exchange for
a decent bedtime hour.
Helping your tot with the transition
Toddlers are bound to have some rocky days when they’re giving
up naps, and you may feel helpless in preventing them. However,
here are some tips that may work:
 Avoid car rides and other soothing situations in the late
afternoon. Road trips (even little ones!) and watching televi-
sion on a soft couch make a child particularly vulnerable to a
late-afternoon nap, so avoid these activities if you’re trying to
keep your toddler awake.
 Plan an interesting activity in the late afternoon. Try baking
cookies, creating an art masterpiece, or whipping up a batch
of homemade play dough.
 Feed your child earlier than usual in the evening, even if
this means not eating together as a family. Family mealtime
is important, but during this brief transitional stage you’re
wise to be flexible.
Chapter 8: The Big Tug of War: Sleep from 2 through 3 Years 119

 Move up your child’s bedtime. A toddler who’s giving up his
nap may go to bed as early as 7 p.m. and sleep straight
through till morning.
If you have a nanny or other care provider in your home, let
your caregiver do the preliminaries — bathing, tooth-brushing,
and so on — while you handle other family responsibilities.
Then you can take over for story-time and a snuggle. This
plan allows you to move up the bedtime routine and still get
plenty of quality time with your sweetie. (See Chapter 10 for
other ideas on how to handle this situation.)
Don’t fret too much when these tricks don’t work (and we can
pretty much guarantee that they won’t work every time). Even if
you try your hardest to keep your toddler up until bedtime, he’ll
probably conk out early and wake up too early at least a few times
a week. Inconsistent sleeping patterns at this stage aren’t a set-
back; they’re merely a stage — and this too shall pass.
Starting a quiet time so you can get a break
Even when naptime is history, you can still insist on a little down
time — and it’s a very good idea. In day-care settings, children who
don’t feel like sleeping still spend quiet time on their cots. If you
follow the same plan at home, you get a much-needed break and
your little one develops the valuable skill of quietly entertaining
himself.
To create a quiet time, choose a time early in the afternoon. If it
does turn into a nap, it won’t affect his sleep at night. Then follow
these steps:
 Prepare your child by telling him he needs a little time alone
in his room to rest. He may protest that he’s not tired, but tell
him in a firm and neutral tone that it’s time for him to go to
his room. Take him there and say, “Have a good rest — see
you soon.”
 This is quiet time but not necessarily sleepy-time, so tell him
he doesn’t need to be in his bed. Give him some toys and
books or let him listen to a tape. Don’t expect him to fall
asleep, although later you may see him and Teddy zonked
together on the floor.
 If he won’t stay in his room, use a gate to create a safe and
escape-resistant haven for him.
You can create a little ritual that signals quiet time is over. For
example, give him a digital clock so he can announce when time is
up, or better yet, play a musical tape or CD that runs as long as
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
120

you want quiet time to last. When the music ends, he knows it’s
time for action again. But no cheating: Choosing a 3-hour Wagnerian
opera isn’t fair!
When your child has a lot of freedom in his room, you must be
absolutely sure that the environment is 100-percent safe. Check
outlets, lamp cords, sharp edges, and toys with small parts that
can be swallowed (or put up his nose!).
Handling Common 
Bedtime Problems
Other than sleep problems, no toddler issue causes parents more
concern than potty training. Having your neighbor assure you that
no one ever walked down the aisle in diapers is hardly a consola-
tion if your child’s on her 20th pair of training pants or the preschool
won’t let Junior in until he keeps his pee and poop to himself.
Now add sleep and potty training together, and you have a formula
for high anxiety.
The scoop on poop (and pee) 
at nighttime
The 2- to 3-year-old stage is prime time for learning to use the
potty. This new development is a challenge for sleep routines
because now you have to figure out how to keep her clean and dry
when you’re all asleep!
Parents have lots of questions about how to cope with the pee and
poop and still get some sleep, and we cover the top two in this sec-
tion, offering tips for keeping your sanity when you leave the
diaper days (and nights) behind.
When should I expect my child to stay dry all night?
Surprisingly, staying dry at night isn’t directly related to daytime
potty use. And although some kids do it well before their parents
start potty-training them, kids can’t really be taught to stay dry at
night.
In fact, kids tend to follow in Mommy’s or Daddy’s footsteps. So, to
get an idea of when your child will be ready to stay dry all night,
ask your parents when you reached this milestone. Although most
Chapter 8: The Big Tug of War: Sleep from 2 through 3 Years 121

children stay dry at night by their 5th birthday, those who wet the
bed later than that often have a relative who did it too; it may not
be as genetic as blue eyes, but there’s a strong familial connection.
In fact, when both parents were over 5 before reaching the dry-at-
night stage, their toddler has an 80-percent chance of following suit.
Boys are more likely than girls to be late in developing this ability.
But most pediatricians don’t consider it bed-wetting until a child is
past the age of 6. Up to that time, a child who wets the sheets is
still within normal developmental limits.
As you work on toilet training, it’s useful to recognize the difference
between day and night. Nighttime dryness is primarily a physical
issue; it happens when your child’s body is ready. Daytime dryness,
on the other hand, is as much a psychological process (a tug of war
between babyhood and big personhood) as it is a physical one.
How do I know when my baby is ready 
to forgo nighttime diapers?
Potty training can be a stressful time, and many parents choose to
keep their toddlers in diapers at night just to create an island of
calm. At some point, however, the diapers need to go. You’ll know
your child’s ready to make the switch if:
 She wakes up with a dry (or almost dry) diaper.
 She’s wet in the morning but seems to have wet herself just
before or after waking up.
 She’s 3 or older, and she’s asking to sleep in her panties.
 Your intuition tells you that she may take forever to wake and
head for the bathroom because the comfy, convenient diaper
is there for her.
Even if your child is still soaked in the morning, you may want to
get rid of the diapers as she approaches her third birthday.
Although you can buy large-size diapers, children this age often
feel that diapers are baby stuff and would rather suffer through
some wet sheets than keep wearing the white badge of babyhood.
How do I potty train if my baby 
is sleeping in the crib at night?
If your snookums potty-trains first, you obviously need a plan for
the night because she can’t get out of the crib by herself. Depending
on your own sleep needs, you can follow one of these plans:
 Use diapers at night.
 Give her some help when the potty urge strikes.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
122

If your child frequently uses the “I have to go potty!” line but you
think it’s a ploy to get you in the bedroom in the middle of night,
consider setting up a gate to convert the room to a crib and limit
her movement out of the room.
If your child still calls for help with a midnight pee, you can leave
on a night light and even put a small portable potty in the room so
your tot doesn’t need to leave her room.
What do I do when B.M. stands for blackmail?
A child who is potty trained or close to that goal quickly discovers
that the words “I have to go to the bathroom” have an instant and
almost magical effect on parents. What better way to get Mommy
or Daddy back into the nursery at night than to say that powerful
sentence? It’s a rare parent who can say “No” to a request that
seems so basic and necessary. However, make sure that you main-
tain your loving but firm stance and create an environment where
your child can take care of her own needs.

Stories from the crib: Fancy pants
On Violeta’s third birthday, she received three packages of beautiful new undies
from her aunt. That night, Violeta insisted on wearing a pair of her new fancy pants
to bed. Violeta had been using the potty during the day for many months, but she
woke up each morning swimming. Her mom, Sofia, worried that soaking-wet new
undies would affect Violeta’s self-esteem the next morning.
However, because it was Violeta’s birthday and she was so insistent, Sofia gave in.
The next morning, she found Violeta wet to the gills but not the least bit upset. Violeta
helped her mom strip the wet sheets from the bed, took a quick bath, put on dry
panties, and was ready to face the day.
Sofia was glad Violeta took the experience so well, but she wasn’t looking forward
to washing wet sheets every morning. To make life easier for both of them, Sofia
put three layers of absorbent towels over the bottom sheet each night. This way 
the sheet underneath stayed dry, and Violeta removed the wet towels each morn-
ing. Violeta still wet the bed, but wearing her fancy pants and taking charge of her
own wet towels in the morning made her feel very grownup. Taking care of her own
wet clothing allowed Violeta to be independent and eliminated the need for Sofia to
intervene.
It turns out that Violeta’s dad wet the bed until he was 6, and Violeta followed suit.
But she remained responsible for her own body and stopped wetting the bed when
she was physically able to — with no interference by Mom or Dad.

If your child sleeps in a bed rather than a crib, you can expect her
to use the bathroom on her own — even at night. Parents who still
picture their toddlers as babies often worry that this expectation
is too much for a little tyke. But in reality, toddlers find these steps
quite simple, and they respond positively to the very grownup feel-
ing of caring for their own bodies (although you can expect some
resistance at first).
If you child resists handling potty chores on her own (and tries to
get you involved) at night, she’s craving your attention, not your
help. Take this opportunity to tell her, “You’re getting very
grownup and you can do this.” You’re likely to find that she gains
new confidence and becomes more willing to tackle other big girl
tasks as well.
Getting the message across may take a few nights, but if you follow
these steps you’ll eventually succeed:
 Keep a night light turned on in your toddler’s room so she can
find her way to the door.
 If your child’s bathroom is attached to her bedroom, keep a
small light on there as well.
 If the bathroom is down the hall, put a portable potty chair in
your toddler’s room. Place it on an old bathroom rug to help
absorb any messes.
 Put your toddler in pull-ups, training pants, or regular under-
wear so she doesn’t need your help to pull her pants down.
Also, buy pajamas with elastic waistbands so they’re easy to
slip down (or consider a nightgown if you’re dressing a girl).
Skip the one-piece flannel footies because they’re just too
hard for a toddler to manage.
 Put a couple of pairs of fresh undies and dry pajamas on the
floor in case your child wets herself a little and needs to change.
 Have some dry towels handy so your child can put them on
the bed if the sheets are wet.
Confronting the bogeyman
With each passing month, your child talks more and understands
other people more. Oddly, this increased mental ability doesn’t
always translate into more rational thinking and behavior. On 
the contrary, at the age of 2 children begin developing out-of-
proportion fears of all kinds.
Part II: I Have a Dream: Winning Sleep Strategies for Every Age 
124

Two- to 3-year-olds blur fantasy with reality because they simply
don’t have enough life experience to tell the difference. If you don’t
believe it, take a bunch of 3-year-olds to see a magician. The most
amazing tricks won’t impress them a bit — after all, from their
point of view, things that appear and disappear are just a normal
part of life! (See Chapter 7 for more on how your child’s thinking
impacts her behavior.)
Understanding the difficulty of distinguishing 
between real and unreal
Your child’s fears about bogeymen in the closet and monsters
under the bed stem from his incomplete understanding of the
world around him. As a result, the Teletubbies are as real as his
next-door neighbors, and Oscar the Grouch may live in your trash
can. This overlap of the real person and the pretend character can
be confusing and downright scary. So, if you’re awakened by a
crying toddler who insists, “There’s a monster under my bed!” it’s
not just a ploy to get your attention. From his point of view, that
monster is real.
An infant is secure that his needs will be met and his discomforts
handled, but between 2 and 3 years of age, children become more
aware of their own vulnerability and the fact that their parents
aren’t really all-powerful.
One interesting example of this change is that a toddler who falls
down and hurts himself may yell at or even hit a parent who comes
to comfort him. It’s almost as if he’s saying, “Why did you let me
get hurt?” On some level, he still expects you to protect him against
anything and everything, but when he figures out that you can’t, he
has to sort out some pretty big, complex feelings. As a result, you’ll
see some interesting behavior along the way — and some of it will
involve sleep.
Debunking the demons
Your child’s new fears and feelings can be magnified at night
because of the darkness and his separation from you. If he calls for
you, here are some ways you can make those things-that-go-bump-
in-the-night a little less worrisome:
 Avoid making fun of your child’s worries. Acknowledge
them in your words and your actions.
 Reassure your child verbally. Tell him that you know he’s
worried about the monster but that monsters aren’t real.
 Show your child he’s safe. Take a broom or a flashlight and
look in all the scary hiding places to prove it.
Chapter 8: The Big Tug of War: Sleep from 2 through 3 Years 125

 Leave a small flashlight in your child’s bedroom. This way,
he can check the room out for himself when you’re not there.
(Be sure the flashlight is safe for toddlers — not too heavy, no
sharp edges — and consider placing tape over the battery lid
so little fingers can’t get to the batteries.)
 Place a nightlight in your toddler’s room. Try to find a spot
where it doesn’t cast scary shadows!
 Keep your bedtime rituals quiet and calm. Choose books
that don’t contain alarming images or words. Now is not the
time for tales about snakes, spiders, or big scary dragons.
Of course, not all of your child’s fears are about imaginary crea-
tures. Some of them are about all-too-real monsters like robbers or
murderers. If your little pumpkin worries about these real bad guys,
assure him that it’s your job to keep him safe and that you will.
Often, toddlers’ fears stem from the television or movies, so be
very careful about what your child picks up from the big or little
screen. Even G-rated movies aren’t always safe because your ver-
sion of tame or even cute can be terrifying to a toddler. Do your
best to pick toddler-friendly shows and movies, and try to look at
them through a child’s eyes so you can anticipate problems.
Just because your toddler wants to watch a show over and over,
don’t assume that it isn’t scary. Often children are just trying to
gain a sense of control over their fright. (Adults do this when they
keep repeating a story about a scary experience.) Instead of allow-
ing your child to keep watching an upsetting movie or show:
 Talk to him about the scary scenes and help him understand
that it’s just make-believe.
 Let him know that you understand that the movie was too
scary and that’s why you’re putting it away. He may initially
object, but inwardly he’s relieved that you’re protecting him
from the frightening images.

Part III
Sleep Decisions 
that Involve the
Whole Family

In this part . . .
A
famous Russian author once said, “All happy families
are alike.” But guess what — he was wrong! In reality,
each family, just like each snowﬂake, is one-of-a-kind. This
means that each sleep strategy needs to be unique as well
and that family dynamics always play a role in how, where,
and when your tot sleeps.
In this part we look at the ways that your baby’s or 
toddler’s sleep affects everyone in your family — from
grownups to pint-sized siblings. In Chapter 9, we examine
the new trend toward co-sleeping (sharing your bed with
your baby) and discuss the advantages and disadvantages
of this choice. Chapter 10 talks about managing the differ-
ent sleep needs of two or more kids and offers advice for
raising twins or welcoming an adopted child into your
family. And in Chapter 11, we discuss the big role that day
care and preschool play in your child’s nighttime sleep
and daytime napping.

L
ife’s all about choices, and a big one for new parents is
whether co-sleeping makes sense for you and your baby. Co-
sleeping means your little one sleeps in the same bed with you or
in a different bed in your room. It’s a simple definition but a big
decision — especially if your dream team includes a partner. So
you’re smart to weigh all the factors before you make your choice.
A reassuring note before you start: Any answer you pick will be the
right one as long as it works for you and your partner. So let the
experts squabble endlessly over who’s right — the co-sleepers or
the independent sleepers — and ignore them. As the ultimate
expert on your baby and your family, make your own choice; both
you and your baby will get a great night’s sleep!
In this chapter, we outline the co-sleeping options and offer facts
about its pros and cons, routines, and safety issues. We also pro-
vide important information about the next step: moving to a sepa-
rate bedroom.

The Two Types of Co-Sleeping
Are you thinking that you’d rather snuggle up with your sweetie
than have a crib in a nursery? Or maybe you lean toward the crib-
in-the-room or sidecar option, where you put your baby in a
bassinet or small bed next to yours. Both are excellent choices
with lots of advantages.
When comparing the two co-sleeping methods, keep in mind that
each approach has advantages and drawbacks, and the right deci-
sion is whatever works best for you. Many parents switch from one
approach to another as Baby gets older. Other parents select one
style and stick with it until Junior is old enough for a big kid bed.
This section gives you the ups and downs of each plan.
The baby-in-your-big-bed plan
Putting your baby in bed with you is a co-sleeping strategy that has
some weighty benefits. However, because of the potential dangers,
it’s a choice that requires serious thought and planning.
The hands-down benefits
Snuggling close to your baby is a wonderful feeling. In contrast,
getting out of bed every hour or two to walk to another room can
be a pain — even when you love your little dumpling dearly. So
bringing your newborn into bed with you is cozy, comforting, and
convenient.
Sleeping with Baby is an easy setup for these reasons:
 You save money and hassle. You don’t need to buy a crib or
transform your computer room into a nursery.
 You don’t have to get up as much at night. If you’re breast-
feeding, you don’t need to leave your warm, comfy bed when
your angel says, “Feed me!” You just roll over and presto —
it’s snack time.
 You’re more in tune with your baby (and vice versa). When
parents and babies sleep together, they almost always lie on
their sides facing each other. They also have more moments
of sleep arousal (which translates into less time spent in deep
sleep) and more moments of waking up. So Mom and Dad have
lots of chances to take a quick peek and make sure all’s well —
and baby can do the same. Some researchers suggest that this
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
130

closeness may help to lower the risk of sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS), an issue we discuss in depth in Chapter 4.
 Co-sleeping in your bed helps set your baby’s internal clock.
Babies can’t tell day from night at first (more on this in
Chapter 4), which is a big challenge for their sleep-starved
parents. But babies who co-sleep quickly pick up on Mommy’s
or Daddy’s waking and sleeping rhythms.
Contrary to what you may suspect, different bedtimes aren’t a
problem if you share a room. You can pop Baby into your bed 
in the evening and join him there later. Of course, this option is
only available if you can situate your bed and baby in a way that
ensures your baby truly can’t fall. This approach puts some dis-
tance between parent and child but only until you go to sleep.
The most common concerns
So why is sharing a bed a hard choice? One word: safety. You need
to work very hard to create a secure, baby-friendly environment,
and this choice requires a very big commitment from any grownup
that’s in the bed with baby. (More on these issues in “If you’re in
the same bed” later in this chapter.)
The number-one worry about co-sleeping is whether it increases
the risk of a baby suffocating. Even though this question is so
important, the answer isn’t a simple yes or no. These are the two
main points of contention:
 A deeply sleeping parent can roll over on her baby.
True, a sleeping parent may roll over on a baby with tragic
results. However, this is a very rare event, and the safety steps
we outline in this chapter reduce this risk even further. And
remember, sleeping in a separate bed (or room) isn’t risk-free
either.
 Too much carbon dioxide (CO2) can cause Baby to stop
breathing. CO2 is the big clue for our bodies to take the next
breath; too much CO2 can lull the brain into saying, “I don’t
need to breathe right now,” and that’s very dangerous.
When Baby cuddles with Mom or Dad, they’re nose-to-nose.
As a result,
• Some of the CO2 that a parent exhales enters Baby’s 
airspace.
• Baby gets covered up more during co-sleeping than in a
crib, and this can increase CO2 levels.
Chapter 9: Keeping Baby Nearby? Co-Sleeping with Your Little One 131

• The risk of SIDS (which is greater for babies who sleep
on their sides instead of their backs) is even more of a
concern.
However, a tiny rise in CO2 levels can actually stimulate
breathing, which appears to happen with babies who co-sleep
closely with their parent(s). The CO2 level goes up enough to
stimulate breathing but not enough to interfere with it. So co-
sleeping may offer another way to reduce the risk of SIDS.
Studying a handful of families in the lab isn’t enough to answer the
co-sleeping safety question, so scientists are now looking at mil-
lions of families to see whether the behavior is risky in the real
world. We can’t dive into all the research in this book, but in short,
co-sleeping is not the risk — the risk lies in the dangerous actions
of parents while (or before) co-sleeping. When you eliminate those
problems, co-sleeping looks like a safe option. (See the section
“Tips for Safe and Sound Co-Sleeping” later in this chapter for spe-
cific advice.)
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
132
Sleeping together is more than a fad
Co-sleeping isn’t just a fad. It always was — and still is — the choice for most of 
the world’s parents. (The controversy about it isn’t new, either – Saint Augustine
took a stand against it back in the year 400!) Only one culture is out of step on this
issue — Western-European-based societies. Here’s a quick look at what other cul-
tures do:
 In Bali, parents carry their babies all day, almost never putting them down, and
co-sleep all night. Both parents and children sleep in bits and pieces through-
out the day.
 In Japan, about 2⁄3 of families co-sleep, with Baby in a separate bed in the same
room or (less often) in the grownup bed. About 1⁄4 of these dads head off to the
spare bedroom, leaving Mom and Baby together.
 In Brazil, nearly 100 percent of newborns and 80 percent of 2-year-olds co-sleep.
 Swiss parents hardly ever sleep with their newborns — but nearly 1⁄3 sleep with
their toddlers.
 Babies in Germany and the Netherlands almost always snooze in their own
rooms.

The separate-bed, same-room 
strategy
For some people, “Two’s company, three’s a crowd” takes on new
meaning when Number Three has a cold or spits up all over your
pillowcase. These parents want their own bed to offer a welcome
bit of distance. The solution is a child’s bed in your bedroom —
together, but not too together. As a middle course, this choice joins
same-bed co-sleeping as an increasingly popular arrangement.
Depending on the age of your child, the bed can be a bassinette, a
sidecar (a type of infant bed specially designed to be attachable to
your bed), a crib, or, when the child is older, a bed.
The following are some advantages of this form of co-sleeping:
 Your baby is right next to you but you still have some space.
If you’re breastfeeding and using a sidecar, you can pick her
up without getting out of bed. If you’re using a bottle, you can
pop her back in the sidecar when you’re done and go right
back to sleep. When she needs a pat and a reassuring word,
you can offer both — and when you need a reassuring check,
you just open your eyes!
 The independent bed eliminates almost every risk of co-
sleeping. The bed is your territory and not baby’s, so you
don’t need to worry about sleeping too deeply, draining your
waterbed, or putting Great-Grandma’s quilt in storage — as
long as you put your honey bun right back in the sidecar after
a feeding.
 It’s pee-proof. If that no-leak diaper turns out to be less than
perfect, the nearby bed gets soaked — but you don’t.
 It makes moving day simpler. If you plan to move your baby
into her own room when she’s older, you can simply move the
crib from your room to the nursery. The fact that your baby
stays in the same bed makes this change easier for her.
So what’s the downside? Really, only one: You may not like this
way of sleeping together. Skin-to-skin contact is powerful, and
having your baby nearby isn’t quite the same as snuggling her up
next to you.
Chapter 9: Keeping Baby Nearby? Co-Sleeping with Your Little One 133

Deciding Whether Co-Sleeping 
Is Right for You
The only people who really matter in the decision about co-sleeping
are the people who sleep in your house — and, in particular, the
people who sleep in your bed. But how do you decide what’s right
for them and for you? These questions can help:
 Are you truly comfortable with the idea of co-sleeping?
Because co-sleeping isn’t better or worse for your child, do
what makes you happy. Some issues of personal comfort to
consider include:
• Comfort: This sounds simple, but consider whether
having your baby in your bed is physically comfortable
or comforting for both parents. In your heart of hearts,
does this setup feel right and make sense to both of you?
• Intimacy: This issue is clearly in the eye of the beholder.
Only you and your partner can decide whether co-
sleeping interferes with your time together.
• Sleep disruptions: As your child gets older, he can make
sleep in a family bed or room bumpier by snoring, sleep-
talking, and even sleepwalking. These issues seem to
start after 18 months of age, but they’re worth consider-
ing early to avoid painful interruptions of your sleep.
 How does your partner feel about co-sleeping? Co-sleeping
is a big lifestyle change, and everyone needs to be happy with
the decision. The great richness of two parents is their two
perspectives, but this advantage becomes a challenge when
they have to agree on major decisions like co-sleeping.
We recommend the following:
• Make the decision well before it has to be made, during
a time free of pressure or crisis. Pick a quiet moment
(rare as they are!) to have that chat.
• Listen carefully to the partner who really wants to co-
sleep. But if one of you can’t find a way to be comfort-
able with this, preserve the partnership and defer to the
partner who wants to keep the bed as grownup turf.
• Remember that any adult in a co-sleeping bed must care
deeply for your baby.
 Have you contemplated the realities of co-sleeping? Along
with wonders of bonding and cuddling come the not-so-fun
diaper smells and the lack of privacy. If you share your bed,
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
134

you’ll also make some changes in your bedtime routine and
the bed itself. (For a quick look at these safety concerns, flip
forward to “If you’re in the same bed” later in this chapter.)
 How do you feel about giving other kids (or Fido or Fluffy)
the boot if you’re co-sleeping in the same bed? Co-sleeping
is more complicated, less safe, and pretty darned uncomfort-
able if you have more than one kid in the bed (and an older
child can never sleep next to a baby because it’s dangerous).
When your baby is little, the rule is: Only one kid in the bed at
a time — and no pets. Be sure you and your family members
are okay with this setup.
 How long do you want to co-sleep? Co-sleeping has no set
time limit, but you need to have a limit in mind. Some parents
co-sleep for three weeks, some for three years or more. The
later section “Phasing Out the Family Bed” has more info on
this decision.
If your answers to these questions give you the green light
and you relish the idea of going cheek-to-cheek with your
cuddle bug at night, then co-sleeping can be a great choice.
On the other hand, if you cherish your privacy and dread
giving up some of your adult pleasures (an evening glass of
Chardonnay, your big goose-down comforter, or those sponta-
neous romantic moments — see “If you’re in the same bed”
later in this chapter), then a crib in the nursery can be an
excellent way to go.
As long as your baby is safe in the setting you pick, he’ll be happy,
healthy, emotionally well-adjusted, and well-rested.
Chapter 9: Keeping Baby Nearby? Co-Sleeping with Your Little One 135
When Baby makes three:
The issue of intimacy
One drawback to co-sleeping is that it makes romance tricky. Just plain cuddling
isn’t a problem. But what do you do when the sparks really fly?
If your baby is little and your bed is big, the answer is easy: Just scoot her safely to
one side. Don’t worry — she won’t have the foggiest idea what you’re up to, so you
won’t bother her a bit. Under the age of 9 months, infants don’t know what’s going
on and aren’t frightened by their parents being intimate. Many infants remain bliss-
fully unaware for many months past this point.
When your child gets old enough to be aware, or if you’re uncomfortable — some
parents have a hard time getting in the mood with a little one in the room, even when
she’s tiny — then find another spot like a comfy futon or sofa where you and your
(continued)

Creating Your Co-Sleeping Routine
In the real world, parents tend to combine the different co-sleeping
strategies. That’s a good plan because a flexible sleeping style can
keep everyone happy.
Considering a few options
Here’s a handful of co-sleeping arrangements that seem to work
well in the real world:
 Your baby can start in your bed but end up in your room in
a separate crib or bed. If you choose this approach, have her
spend time in the big bed with you before you fall asleep and
let her enjoy another quick visit for each feeding. This way,
you still get some cuddle time with your sweetie and you get
your comfy bed all to yourself while you snooze.
 Your baby can start out in her own crib or bed in the
grownup room and end up in your bed. This option allows
for some flexibility. If your infant wakes up, it’s okay to fall
asleep together in your bed after feeding.
 Your toddler can start in her bed in her own room and end
up in your bed in your room. This option is perhaps the
most frustrating of them all — and usually it’s the child’s
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
136
partner can be intimate. Just like babies, parents are resilient and flexible (which
can be handy if that futon is small!). Every once in a while, if you can afford it, turn
your sweetie over to a sitter and have a romantic night at a local hotel.
Of course, intimacy means more than just sex, so make time every day for grownup
snuggling and conversation. That’s especially important in those early months,
because dads often feel a little left out when baby enters the picture.
And Dads: Remember that new moms need to know they’re just as sexy and beau-
tiful as ever. Even if co-sleeping makes intimacy a little trickier, make sure you keep
the flame of romance alive.
Above all, share your feelings with each other. A new baby means change — in
your sleep, your sex life, your days, your nights, and your relationship — and
grownups react in a variety of ways to this big and exciting upheaval. Even if baby
is sharing your bed, make time for some one-on-one with your partner so you 
can enjoy each other’s company and explore your feelings about your new roles as
parents.
(continued)

choice, not the parents’. But if you like this arrangement, it’s
certainly an option your child will enjoy. (See Chapter 8 for
details on how to stop your tot from invading your territory if
you don’t want it to keep happening.)
Of course, if your baby sleeps with you in the same bed for even a
little while, be sure to follow all the precautions for same-bed
sleeping in the section “Tips for Safe and Sound Co-Sleeping,” later
in this chapter.
Assessing your situation
When you consider your own co-sleeping routine, the following
questions can help guide your plans:
 Do you have any habits that may make co-sleeping unsafe?
Examples include the two greatest dangers to co-sleeping:
smoking and drinking. Another red flag is a parent who’s often
exhausted. Tired parents are at greater risk of rolling over
onto an infant.
 Do you have any sleep disorders? If you do, avoid co-sleeping
in the same bed with your baby. People with sleep apnea — a
medical condition that causes them to stop breathing for longer-
than-normal periods during sleep — can sleep so deeply they
may not notice they they’ve rolled onto a baby. Sleep apnea is
quite common and can be associated with conditions like
allergies and obesity.
 Are you willing and able to make your co-sleeping setup
physically safe? If you co-sleep in the same bed, you need to
make sure you take all the necessary steps to be sure the bed,
bedding, and placement of the bed are safe (see the next sec-
tion for complete details on safety).
 Does your routine feel right for you and your partner? It’s
crucial to get an honest answer to this question: Do you both
really like having your baby in bed with you? If so, great. If
not, look at different options that can keep you close without
making one partner uncomfortable. Feeling good about your
sleep is very, very important, and needless suffering tends to
have bad effects on everyone.
If your answers don’t paint a clear picture, try charting the pros
and cons of co-sleeping for each partner and see whether you 
can work out solutions and compromises that work for everyone.
Table 9-1 shows how one family laid out their co-sleeping issues
and came up with ways to handle each one.

Our only caution with mixing and matching styles is that you pick a

this each night. He’ll get on a schedule more easily if he falls asleep
and wakes up in a predictable spot each night.

Tips for Safe and Sound 
Co-Sleeping
The message from scientists, at least so far, is that co-sleeping is
safe if you make it safe. So if you choose to snooze with your little
sunflower, you need to follow a few basic do’s and don’ts. Some of
these rules apply only to same-bed co-sleeping, but if you’re plan-
ning the crib-in-the room strategy or the sidecar option, you still
need to keep general considerations in mind. In this section, we
cover them all.
General tips no matter your method
Co-sleeping, if it’s not done correctly, can cause physical harm or
increase the risk of SIDS in so many ways that some experts (and
at times even the American Academy of Pediatrics) simply advise:
Don’t do it.
Chapter 9: Keeping Baby Nearby? Co-Sleeping with Your Little One 139
Stories from the crib: A tale of two cities
When the sun sets over Tokyo, Yoshiro and Midori tuck 12-month-old Akio into their
bed. Later, they snuggle up with him for the rest of the night. Akio wakes them up
three or four times each week, and when he cries or fusses, it’s always Mom’s job
to ease him back to sleep — an easy task with him close at hand.
In Tulsa, Kevin and Janet sometimes bring 10-month-old Kelly into bed with them
for a brief stay before popping her into her crib. Most nights, however, they tuck her
into her own bed, kiss her goodnight, and shut the door. If she cries during the night,
they wait for her to go back to sleep on her own. When she doesn’t, Kevin or Janet
gives her a quick pat and then shuts the door.
Both Akio and Kelly sleep happily and well, and so do their parents. Yet the two fam-
ilies have very different sleep styles and different expectations. Yoshiro and Midori
believe that sleeping with Mom and Dad gives Akio a sense of security during the
night. When he cries, it means, “Mom needs to solve the problem.” Kevin and Janet
see Kelly’s crying as a chance for her to learn independence. They also see the
occasional middle-of-the-night visits as a job either parent can do.
Both families are making decisions based on what works for them and what’s
common practice in their cultures. In both cases, their solutions work just fine
because babies can usually (and happily) adapt to an astounding range of sleep
styles when parents keep schedules consistent and free from too much disruption.

But, after careful review of the medical literature, we have con-
cluded that co-sleeping is much too common to simply say “Don’t.”
More importantly, parents can make co-sleeping safe when they
take a few critically important precautions.
This may be the most important section of the chapter. If you read
only a few pages about co-sleeping, please choose these because
they contain a crucial list of dangers.
 Don’t light up — even outdoors and even if you’re away from
your baby! If you plan to co-sleep, this is the mother-of-all
rules for Mom and Dad and anyone else who lives with you.
(And if you’re a smoker and getting a jump-start by reading
this book while you’re still pregnant, kick the habit now.)
Due to the unbelievably poisonous effects of tobacco smoke
on the baby, the incidence of SIDS skyrockets when someone
smokes in the same house, outside the house — whenever,
wherever. The chemicals released by burning tobacco can
impair your baby’s ability to breathe, even if she breathes 
the residue off someone’s clothing well after that person has
smoked. In fact, one big study published at the turn of the mil-
lennium in the British Medical Journal concluded: “Co-sleeping
has no impact on SIDS risk if the parents don’t smoke.” The
no-smoking rule applies to every form of co-sleeping, even if
baby isn’t in your own bed.
 Don’t light up even during pregnancy. This important advice
is for the pregnant mother and everyone around her. Cigarette
smoke actually shifts the developing baby’s drive to breathe,
reducing a baby’s drive to get oxygen and increasing her toler-
ance for going without breathing.
The firsthand or secondhand cigarette smoke that the preg-
nant woman inhales actually causes a drop in blood flow to the
baby’s placenta. This very dangerous situation leaves the new-
born more likely to stop breathing — a clear danger no matter
where she sleeps but especially if she sleeps with an adult.
 Keep the bedroom temperature comfortable. A comfortable,
not-too-hot temperature (ideally about 65 degrees F) reduces
the risk of SIDS. If you sleep with your baby tucked next to
you, your body heat makes it pretty toasty already — so keep
your room comfortable but not too warm.
If you’re in the same bed
In addition to the general safety issues, several concerns relate
specifically to sleeping in the same bed.
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
140

Preliminary concerns
Before Baby hits the hay in your bed, keep these cautions in mind:
 Consider holding off on same-bed co-sleeping until your
muffin is 14 weeks old. Newborns do have a higher risk for
SIDS if they co-sleep in the same bed as their parents, but this
additional risk vanishes when they reach 14 weeks of age.
If you eliminate the major risks we describe throughout this
list, you can sleep safely together even in the newest of the
newborn days. Cheating on these safety rules, on the other
hand, is even more dangerous in the first 14 weeks.
 Avoid alcohol and medicines with sedatives. Scientists report
that the risk of rolling over on your baby during the night is
almost nil unless you drink alcohol before turning in. If you or
your partner indulges in the bubbly or tosses down a Scotch
before turning in, your sweet pea is safer alone in his own crib
or in a sidecar. Also, never co-sleep in the same bed if you or
your partner takes medicines that cause drowsiness.
 Stay well-rested (if you can!). The risk of SIDS drops back to
normal when parents get more than four hours of sleep the
previous day. The moral: Sleep well, and you and your baby
can co-sleep safely in the same bed. If you’re burning both
ends of the candle, pop your baby in the crib or a sidecar and
go back to co-sleeping after you catch up on your own sleep.
 Restrict co-sleeping with caregivers. This safety issue is most
urgent if your friend, relative, or hired help is watching the
baby while you get precious time out. Be sure they do not sleep
with the baby unless you feel they truly are very devoted,
caring, and aware of your baby as your baby sleeps. The more
connected co-sleepers are to Baby, the more alert they are to
your little one’s needs.
Concerns with the bed itself
If you’re sharing a bed with your baby, then style and comfort take
second place to safety concerns. Here’s how to keep your little
bambino secure:
 Think firm, not soft. Waterbeds and soft mattresses are out.
Both types raise the risk of SIDS.
 Go with flat, not fluffy bedding.
• Switch to light-weight blankets. Big, heavy blankets
increase the risk of SIDS.
Make sure blankets reach only to your chest, not up to
your shoulders and definitely not up around your face.
Chapter 9: Keeping Baby Nearby? Co-Sleeping with Your Little One 141

• Thin pillows — not big, fluffy ones — are a must.
• Keep your bed’s surface flat and uncluttered. Stuffed ani-
mals and down comforters need to go.
 Keep your Baby away from walls. Walls can be traps — if
Baby sleeps next to a wall, he can get pinned between a
parent and the wall — a dangerous situation. Hard rails or
dividers are a no-no as well. (If you worry about your little
sugar-pie falling out of bed, consider using a mattress on the
floor, a crib, or a bassinet.)
 Choose plain, not fancy. Avoid headboards with cutouts or
slats where Baby’s head can get stuck.
 Decide where your little sugar-bun goes.
• On the side? Stay low. If your baby sleeps on one side of
the bed, your safest setup is to keep your mattress on
the floor. Don’t forget to make sure the surrounding floor
is covered with a carpet or rug.
• In the middle? Be extra careful. A little bundle of joy
that sleeps between two adults is at higher risk for SIDS
unless both of the adults follow every safety rule to the
letter. So no fudging for either of you.
• In it for the long run? Think ahead. If you plan on co-
sleeping into the toddler years, remember that toddlers
almost never sleep in a straight line. They love to lie
stretched out diagonally across the bed, with one arm
poking you in the eye and one foot kicking your partner
in the kidney. If you put your toddler on one side, he can
only torment one of you at a time.
 Make the couch an adults-only zone — sleep with Baby only
in your bed. Co-sleeping on a sofa increases the risk of SIDS
nearly 50 times, a huge jump. (It’s also dangerous for Baby to
nap alone on a couch.)
Phasing Out the Family Bed
At some point, your little lady will get out in the world — but for
now, she just needs to get into her own room! The age that she
makes this transition depends on your situation and your comfort-
able level, and it varies from family to family. In this section, we
offer guidance for making the big switch to independence.
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
142

Baby, meet nursery!
If you decide to switch from co-sleeping to a crib in the nursery
any time before the 1-year mark, just pick a night and make the
move. Be sure to follow your usual bedtime routine before tucking
your sweetie into his new crib. If your child doesn’t feel like making
the switch but you’re ready for him to move on, count on some
hurt feelings and be prepared to manage them.
Your child needs the chance to adapt to this new place that you
call his bedroom. Let him fuss for a while the first night or two, 
but if he howls at the moon for more than 15 minutes, head to
Chapters 5 and 6, where we go into more detail on managing this
kind of reaction.
Toddler, meet big-kid bedroom!
If you’re considering making the switch from co-sleeping to inde-
pendence with a child who’s at least 1 year old, look for cues from
your toddler to see whether she’s ready. Sometimes, children —
not parents — are the first to decide they’re ready for a big-kid
room. Some signs to look for include:
 Resistance to going to your bed
 Wandering out of your room to lie down and sleep elsewhere
 For older children who are able to talk, when they say so!
When you do decide it’s time to make a change, do so in a way 
that continues the closeness you have with your youngster so she
doesn’t feel as if she’s been thrust into a whole new situation. If
your toddler is aching to have her space, you’re in luck — just
introduce her to her new room, help her feel comfortable in her
new space, and settle in for a good night’s sleep. If your toddler is
less than eager to leave Mommy and Daddy’s room, though, you’re
in for a bit of a struggle — nothing you can’t handle, of course.
Smoothing the move for a resistant tyke
If the transition is your idea and not your toddler’s, follow these
steps to make the transition easier:
1. Explain to your toddler that she’s getting very grown up
and is ready to have a big-girl room all for herself. Above
all, let your little moppet know that you’re excited about
Chapter 9: Keeping Baby Nearby? Co-Sleeping with Your Little One 143

her new grownup room and proud of her for taking this big
step toward independence. (It’s natural to feel a little weepy
about the change yourself, but try not to let it show.)
2. Give her some ownership in the big move and the new
place. Let her put her favorite toys (and maybe some new
ones) where she wants them and let her help pick out her
sheets and blankets.
3. Move your bedtime ritual to your little sugarplum’s new
room. If you had a rocker in your room, move it so you can
enjoy story time and quiet play time together in the new
room.
4. If your toddler has a bed and not a crib in her new room,
lie down with her for the first night or two just until she
falls asleep. That way, she doesn’t have to say “Goodbye”
to her old bed and her beloved sleeping buddy all at once.
Remaining firm
As we mention in the beginning of this section, expect to have a
few rocky days when you make this big leap to independence. Stay
firm and don’t backslide or else you’ll go through the same strug-
gle again later.
What does firm mean? It means you stay out of her new room long
enough to accomplish two goals:
 Convince your child that the change has indeed happened:
Going in to check on her only confuses her. She doesn’t under-
stand that you’re just checking, so she concludes that you’re
coming in to spend the night.
 Let your child have the time and space to make the change
work: Each time you appear, you open up the option that
you’re managing this problem for her.
As rough as this transition may be, it is also brief. In our experi-
ence, such transitions usually take one to two nights, rarely more
than a week if parents handle it as we advise (see Chapter 5). This
length of time is typical for all young children — infants through
10-year olds.
If your toddler wants to wander, see the tips in Chapter 8 for keep-
ing her safely in her room.

Chapter 10
Move Over, Darlin’!
When a Sibling 
Enters the Picture
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the sibling’s bumpy road
 Arranging the new sleeping quarters
 Helping #1 anticipate the baby and enjoy the new role
 Dealing with the variety of sleep schedules
 Adjusting to unique situations: Adopted babies and twins
Your first time as a parent was a leap into the great unknown,
but now you’re a pro at everything from changing diapers to
bandaging boo-boos. You’re at the top of your game, and it shows.
Your new baby feels this confidence, and as a result, there’s a good
chance he sleeps more soundly than your firstborn. It doesn’t
always work this way because each baby is a unique little person.
But even if your new cherub is a holy terror at night, the tricks you
mastered the first time around can help you stay on top of the situ-
ation this time around.
However — you knew there was a catch, didn’t you? — it’s not just
Baby #2 you need to worry about. In fact, even if your firstborn has
this sleeping thing down pat, she’s likely to be the one who’s up at
all hours, demanding attention while your new little angel sleeps
peacefully.
In this chapter, we explain why a sibling’s arrival can throw even
the perfect sleeper’s patterns into chaos and what you can do to
head this problem off at the pass. We also talk about balancing
bedtimes for your brood — a tricky issue when Baby needs quiet

and your wide-awake older child wants to sing the Hokey Pokey or
bang on her new birthday drum. In addition, we look at the special
sleep issues that adoption raises and the double joy (and double
trouble at bedtime) if your bundle of joy turns out to be twins.
Understanding How Baby #2
Affects Baby #1’s 
Bedtime Behavior
Parents know that a sibling’s arrival is a big deal for an older child,
and they watch carefully for signs that #1 is having trouble coping.
Alarm bells go off in their heads when their toddler gives the
newbie a pinch or gets too rough when helping the baby.
But children often show their emotions in more subtle ways, and
one of them is by having trouble sleeping. When young children
deal with big conflicting feelings — and a new brother or sister
really stirs up those feelings! — this turmoil can creep into their
consciousness as they cycle through deep and light sleep at night.
(Check back to Chapter 2 for more on these cycles.)
This turmoil explains why the sweetie who says, “I love my little
brother” can be up at 2 a.m. saying, “I lost my Teddy,” or “I had a
bad dream.” The inner conflict also explains why the little angel
who keeps her feelings under wraps — who doesn’t sneak a pinch
or a poke — often has the biggest nighty-night issues when baby
moves in. One way or another, those powerful feelings need to
come out.
Luckily, some simple strategies can help you get your older child
back on the track to Sleepyland. In the next sections, we look at
techniques you can use before a sibling arrives and ways to help a
toddler who’s already dealing with a new brother or sister.
Making Room for Baby
Remember those old black-and-white movies where babies slept
soundly in a dresser drawer? It’s a different story these days, with
more paraphernalia for Baby than ever before. Depending on the
age of your firstborn, you may have a huge array of decisions
about where Baby #2 will lay his little head.
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
146

Figuring out where Baby will live
Some parents feel strongly that each child should have his or her
own room. If you have the space, this setup has lots of pluses:
 A newborn’s crying is less likely to wake the older child.
 When Mom or Dad feeds or changes the newborn in a shared
room in the middle of the night, it may disturb the older child.
 A toddler who’s struggling with sleep and getting in and out of
bed may disturb a newborn who’s just getting used to finding
his own way to sleep.
 A room of her own can help a toddler feel less displaced, which
can soothe some of that sibling rivalry that disturbs sleep.
Handling the shared-room situation
The one-room-per-kid plan is great, but children end up sharing a
room for plenty of reasons — and the good news is that doubling
up (or even tripling up, in some cases) can and does work for mil-
lions of families. Check out the following questions to size up your
shared living quarters:
 Do I have to worry when my toddler and baby aren’t the
same sex? Not really, at least for the first three years. (Later
on, you can get a screen to divide the room and provide 
some privacy.)
Also, a child who’s starting potty training may begin to develop
a keen sense of modesty. Do what you can to accommodate her
while she’s figuring out how to be in charge of her own body.
 Is it all right to put the baby in with my oldest child instead
of with the child who’s closer in age? Yes. This arrangement
often works quite well. In part, it depends on the sexes of the
children — especially if this is a long-term arrangement.
 I’d like to keep the baby in my room for the first few
months. Is this okay for the baby and will my older child
feel resentful? Yes — and yes! Keeping Baby close is a great
idea, but your toddler may raise a fuss about it. If so, calmly
and matter-of-factly explain that keeping Baby with you allows
everybody to sleep well. You can also talk about when Baby
will move into another room. (See Chapter 9 for more details
on sharing a room with your baby.)
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 147

Setting up the room
You may not love the lack of symmetry of a crib and a bed in the
same room, but your kids will be fine with it as long as you prepare
the older one for the change and make her feel at home. Here are
some ways to do just that:
 Include #1 in preparing the room for two. She can help you
rearrange the furniture and pick out items for the new room.
 Try not to clutter the room with baby stuff. Keep some of
Baby’s items in your room or elsewhere in the house.
 Invest in some inexpensive shelves for your older child’s 
possessions so she has a place to call her own. You can even
label the shelves (for instance, make a colorful sign that says
Sara’s stuff ).
 Even if privacy isn’t an issue, think about purchasing a light-
weight screen to divide the room. This gives the older child a
sense that she still has her own space.
Preparing Numero Uno 
for the Big Event
If your new baby is still resting cozily inside Mommy, you have a
golden opportunity to nip your toddler’s sleep problems in the
bud. An ounce of prevention really is worth a pound of cure at this
point; taking a few steps now can spare you nights of sleeplessness
later.
The following sections offer great tricks so your toddler can rest at
night rather than toss and turn about that sibling on the way.
Giving your toddler a heads-up
Children don’t like big surprises, especially if they involve major
life changes. You don’t need to break the news the instant the preg-
nancy test reads positive, but don’t wait too long. You may hear
some people say, “Wait until right before your due date.” We dis-
agree. Your toddler can’t miss the fact that Mom’s getting a great-
big tummy, and she overhears those grocery-store questions like
“So when’s the baby coming?” “Are you excited?” “Wow, are you
ready for the big day?” Your toddler’s smart, and she’ll be on these
clues like Sherlock Holmes on a footprint. So make your toddler
part of the inner circle for the blessed event.
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
148

When you begin to freely discuss the event with others, it’s time to
let your older one in on the secret. Toddlers don’t have a good
grasp of time, so keep the news simple and straightforward and
offer helpful clues. For instance, you can say, “We’ll have a new
baby at our house at Thanksgiving time.”
A young child can’t fully understand what being a big brother or
sister means (it’s hard enough for you to imagine having a new
arrival!), but here are some ideas to try out during the waiting period:
 Point out other newborns when you’re out. Tell your child,
“Our baby will be very small like that,” or “Look, this baby
can’t walk or talk yet. See how little her hands are?” These
casual comments help your toddler know what to expect a
few months down the road.
 Talk to your child about all the big-boy things she can do
already (talk, drink from a cup, and so forth). Let her know
that the new baby won’t be able to do those at first.
 Avoid telling your older one how much she’ll love the new
baby. Even before the arrival, #1 is likely to have some ambiva-
lence about this big change. If she feels like she has to love 
the baby (but she’s not sure she will), worried thoughts and
sleepless nights may ensue.
Creating a special book
Children love a good book — especially when it’s all about them! A
book just for your toddler, with pictures and words about her role
in the new baby’s arrival, is more enchanting to her than the glossi-
est book from the library.
To create this singular sensation, buy an inexpensive photo album
and use magazine photos, drawings, and index cards to make a
special nonfiction story about your toddler and the new baby. See
Figure 10-1 for a good example of how to set one up.
Make sure your toddler takes center stage in each caption to help
her feel like an important part of this new family adventure.
Include the need-to-know info in your book — for instance, who’s
going to stay with your older child when you go to the hospital —
but don’t forget to add the feelings part, too, because those pesky
sensitivities really get in the way of sleep. State in plain words that
your child will be excited to be a big sister but sometimes she 
may feel mad because the baby takes so much of Mommy and
Daddy’s time.
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 149

Figure 10-1: A personal book helps prepare your child for future events.
Playing musical beds early on
Planning to keep your older child in the crib for awhile? If so,
borrow or buy another crib for your new arrival, or let the new
little bundle sleep in a bassinet for the first few months. Assuming
there’s no risk of jumping out of the crib, let your toddler keep her
own nest rather than moving her into a new crib, even if it’s newer
or prettier. From her point of view, there’s no place like home —
and that crib is her little home at night.
If you’re not sure whether your toddler will be ready for a big bed
when baby arrives, err on the side of caution. Rushing a young tod-
dler (under 2 years) into a big bed right before the stork comes
can be too much change to handle.
Some babies make an early entrance, so don’t get caught with your
crib rails down! Give your first child time to adjust so she doesn’t
feel like you’re evicting her to make room for that new kid. (See
Chapter 7 for tips on moving your toddler to a big bed.) In addi-
tion, make the transition feel like a move up instead of a move out.
Try the following tried-and-true tricks:
 Let your sweetie shop with you for special sheets, pillows,
and room decorations.
 If you’re switching your older child to a new room but she’s
still in a crib or toddler bed, keep the old bed for a while
instead of switching two routines at once.
While Mommy is in
the hospital, Samantha
will be with Grandma.
At night, Samantha
and Daddy will stay
and sleep at home.
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
150

 If #1 is getting a new room, add something special like a
child’s tape player and some new sleepy-time CDs to make
nighty-night time something to look forward to.
Handling the Emotional Tug 
of War When Baby Arrives
When your new little sweetums arrives, you may find you’re deal-
ing with three nightly feedings plus a toddler at 2 a.m. saying, “I
wanna rock with you, too!” If so, you need to get your firstborn
back on the nightly path to Dreamland.
The first step is to look at the situation from your toddler’s view-
point. In Chapter 8, we talk about the toddler’s emotional tug of
war: On one side is the baby who doesn’t want to grow up, and on
the other side is the big child. This conflict heats up when your
toddler is no longer the baby but the big sister. Suddenly the baby
side of the rope starts looking even better — especially when #1
sees the newcomer getting away with fussing and pooping his
pants while she’s expected to act like a big girl.
At the same time, your toddler has another tug of war going on in her
mind: “Should I be loving or unkind?” “I’m proud because Mommy
says I’m a big help with the baby.” “I’m mad because Daddy’s play-
ing with the baby and he’s not paying any attention to me.”
This inner debate continues all day and even laps over into dream-
time. To quiet your toddler’s inner volcano so she can sleep through
the night, give your little bundle-of-feelings a chance to sort out
her emotions in the sunny hours. Just like a grownup, she can get a
better grip on her feelings if she talks it over with a good friend —
and that’s you. In this section we show you how you can help.
Be sensitive but firm
Your daughter may love her brother — some of the time — but not
always. This fluctuation is perfectly normal, and she needs to hear
from you that it’s okay to love the baby sometimes and be pretty
mad at him (and you) at other times. When you do, you acknowl-
edge the ideas she already has and give her a wonderful gift of let-
ting her know that you understand how she feels. Parents who don’t
allow tots to express their negative feelings will feel the repercus-
sions. A toddler’s reactions can take many forms, but sleep troubles
are one of the most common — so acknowledge your sweetie’s feel-
ings in the day, or you’ll get the message a different way at night!
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 151

Being firm with your confused little tyke is as important as being
understanding. If you spot your love-bug’s gentle pat on Baby’s arm
turning into a hard squeeze, you need to set limits. When you step
in, acknowledge her feelings and offer a safe release valve for them.
For instance, you can say, “When I see you hurt your brother, I know
you’re angry with him. You can be as angry as you want, but I will not
let you hurt him. When you get those angry feelings, you can punch
your pillow really, really hard.” Or let her stomp her feet or say,
“I’m angry!” as loud as she wants. Here’s another idea: If your child
wants to draw an angry picture or tell a story about her feelings,
you can help her turn her words or picture into a special-feelings
book that she can refer to when she’s upset about the new baby.
Plan ahead
At times when baby gets your undivided attention — feeding time,
for instance — you can count on your toddler to throw a monkey
wrench into the works. As soon as you settle down in a comfy chair
with your newborn, you’re likely to hear, “I need a drink!” or “I’m
hungry!” or “I want that toy on the bookcase.”
Anticipate this attack of toddler jealousy and ward it off by making
a special bag for your older child. (A sturdy canvas bag is a good
choice because it lasts a long time and it’s easy to throw in the
washer.) Be sure it contains a fun selection of snacks and toys, and
try to rotate the contents once a week.
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
152
Stories from the crib: A trashy tale
Jon and Jenn knew they were in for some sleepless nights when they brought their
second son home from the hospital, but they didn’t expect 2-year-old Luke to be the
one up at night! After consulting with his pediatrician, they understood that even
though Luke seemed to love his new sibling, some big feelings about having to share
Mom and Dad were interfering with his sleep.
Jon and Jenn helped Luke express his ambivalent feelings about the baby and gave
him permission to be angry when the baby cried and demanded attention from Mom
and Dad. His response almost knocked them over: After listening to their support-
ive words, he screwed up his face and yelled, “Yes, I am so angry I could throw you
all in the garbage!”
Jon and Jenn were able to see the strength of their child’s feelings and the power
that their words had in helping Luke sort those feelings out. Soon, this little guy was
back to sleeping through the night.

At Baby’s feeding time, get the bag and tell your toddler, “I need to
feed the baby right now, but here’s your special bag — let’s see
what’s inside today!” Your big girl may still whine, but at least you
both know that she’s getting attention, too.
The Juggling Act: Managing
Multiple Bedtimes
Think it’s a challenge to get one child to sleep? Add a brother or
sister to the mix, and the fun really starts. But they’ll all have
sweet dreams — and so will you — if your bedtime strategies take
family dynamics into account.
In the following sections, we explain how to satisfy each sib’s
needs for naps and nighttime. In addition, we offer tips for those
times when your newborn squalls nonstop and your toddler says,
“I can’t sleep with all that crying!”
The bedtime balancing act
Did you ever watch a juggler spin several plates on sticks all at once?
Well, that’s nothing compared to getting a couple (or more) kids to
sleep at once! When children are very young, it’s helpful to take a Zen
attitude and just remember the old adage: “This too will pass.” But
then again, even the hardest jobs can become more manageable.
Putting your kids to bed
Getting one child to sleep is easy when you get the knack of it.
Trying to get two kids tucked into bed, however, is a little like herd-
ing cats. Your little one is busy crying or pooping or spitting up.
Your toddler is jumping on the sofa or begging for a story or
saying, “Can I watch my favorite movie again?” And nobody’s tired
except you.
You have several options for making the bedtime ritual go more
smoothly:
 Divide and conquer. If you have a partner, developing a plan
to share the responsibilities is the best. For instance, you can
decide that you’ll give Keisha her bath, feed her, and change
her. Your partner can help Samuel with his jammies, read his
bedtime story, and tuck him in. It’s surprising how much
easier bedtime is when everyone knows the drill.
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 153

 Find a helper — real or cartoon! If you’re single-parenting or
just have a spouse who’s conveniently absent at bedtime, you
may need to do a little compromising:
• An appropriate video may be a lifesaver if it keeps your
toddler occupied while you’re with the baby. By appro-
priate, we mean something very calm and soothing —
nothing with loud music, scary images, or complex plots
that keep your little one awake.
• Hiring a young neighbor to come over for an hour can be
just the ticket for some nighttime relief. Even a 12-year-
old can play with your toddler as you get Baby down to
sleep, and kids usually work cheap. You’re home, so the
sitter’s maturity isn’t a big issue.
 Break out your toddler’s special bag while you’re getting
Baby ready for bed. For nighttime use, fill the bag with quiet,
sleepy-time toys and books like an Etch-a-Sketch or a doll that
your love-bug can undress and get ready for bed For the low-
down on your toddler’s special bag, see the section “Plan
ahead,” earlier in this chapter.
 If you have older kids in your home, enlist their help in get-
ting your toddler ready for bed. Teens can be very handy
(especially if you offer to bump up their allowance or cell
phone minutes in exchange for extra responsibilities), and
even a 4-year-old can feel mighty proud if she gets to help out
in a grownup way. Another plus: Toddlers often comply more
willingly when a big brother or sister is running the show.
Never allow a child under the age of 12 to supervise a bath or
any other activity that requires adult guidance. Instead, assign
safe jobs like reading a book or helping with jammies. Also, if
you have teenagers and want them to babysit when you go
out for dinner or a movie, make sure they attend a Red Cross
babysitting class or similar training program. The more they
know, the safer your little ones are.
 When your baby is still at the newborn stage, start your tod-
dler’s bedtime ritual right after Baby is fed and down for
the count. This way you’ll feel more relaxed as you bathe your
older child or read to her. Everyone picks up on the tension if
you feel rushed because you’re listening for Baby to wake.
 If your newborn hits his alert stage right when it’s big
sister’s bedtime, trying putting him in a carrier and having
him with you as you go through the older one’s bedtime
routine. Even though you really want to attend to your older
one’s needs, the baby will get a lot out of your interactions by
hearing the splashing water in the tub and listening to the
bedtime story.

Dealing with a finicky toddler
Don’t be surprised if your toddler goes through a stage where she
acts like she prefers one parent over the other. It’s heartbreaking
when your beloved child runs away from you hollering, “No, Mommy
do it!” or “I don’t want you, I want Daddy!” But the reassuring fact
is that this isn’t about you. It’s just a phase, as they say, and she’s
likely to switch favorites a month or two later. Nothing is as fickle
as a toddler, especially when she realizes what a stranglehold she
has on your emotions.
Problems can arise during this phase when you try to get two kids
to bed. For instance, if your toddler insists on Mommy, Daddy can’t
really take over the breastfeeding chore! When your toddler snubs
one parent and it wreaks havoc on your bedtime plans, here’s a
strategy that can calm the waters (usually within a few days):
1. Don’t give in to your child’s demands. “No” is a perfectly
reasonable answer. If you do stand your ground, make sure
you never sink to your child’s level with your response.
(We don’t mean that you can’t get on your knees and look
her straight in the eyes — that’s a good thing!) We mean
don’t respond in a childish way. (We know one Dad who
was so hurt by his child’s words that he replied, “Well, I
don’t want to be with you either!”)
2. Reflect your toddler’s words back to her. For example,
say, “I hear that you’d rather have Mommy give you your
bath. She is busy now, so I will help you wash up. When
you’re through, Mommy will come in and read you a book
and kiss you goodnight.” This matter-of-fact talk helps your
child see that you understand her wishes but can’t give them
to her right now. She may throw a fit, but don’t worry —
she won’t hold a grudge.
3. If your child still carries on, restate your understanding,
continue to hold your ground, and make your child take
a breather. For example, simply say in a neutral voice, “I
see you are still mad. I will wait until you are calm, and then
you can have your bath.” Yelling and punishing may solve
the immediate problem, but they do nothing to stop it from
happening again. Your cool and calm demeanor (even if
you’re bubbling over inside) will help your child relax.
4. If you child rants so long that it’s too late for a bath or a
bedtime story, conclude the bedtime routine and head
straight for the bed. For example, say, “Tomorrow, I think
you’ll be able to listen and have your bath and all your bed-
time stories.”
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 155

This is one time, however, when your gut feeling needs to come
into play. If you sense that your older child really is coming up
short in the parental-attention department, you can say, “I see you
need to be with me right now. I’ll put the baby in his crib, and we
can spend some time together.” Firmness and consistency are
good, but sometimes bending the rules is a wiser strategy.
The crying game: Keeping one kid from waking the other
Your home can get pretty noisy when you’re walking the floor with
a squalling newborn or letting an older baby cry himself to sleep.
All of this commotion can roust your toddler out of bed, and you
may find yourself bouncing one weepy child on your hip while the
other one clutches your leg sniffling, “I can’t slee-ee-eep.”
There’s no surefire solution for this problem, but luckily it’s usually
temporary. If the situation leads to frazzled nerves, here are some
techniques you can try:
 Put your baby to bed first, before your toddler’s bedtime. You
can even enlist your toddler’s help in listening for the baby
crying.
 If your baby is 4 months or younger and he’s not in your
room, move his crib farther away from your toddler’s room.
(Or put your newborn in a much-more-transportable bassinet
and leave the crib where it is.) This arrangement only works
until you’re ready to teach your new baby to get to sleep on
his own; at that point, he needs to have an established room
(see “Making Room for Baby” earlier in this chapter).
 Let your older child sleep in another part of the house. A
sleeping bag and makeshift tent in the den can be a real treat
for a child who’s nearing the 4-year-old mark. Of course, you
need to make sure your toddler’s new environment is every
bit as safe as her own room.
 Get your older child out of the house at nighttime, at least for
a few nights. If your toddler enjoys sleepovers with close and
trusted friends or family, now’s the time to have another! But
bring her home in the daytime so she can enjoy her regular
activities.
The daytime dilemma
Your toddler loved her daytime schedule back when she was the
center of the universe. But what happens now, when Baby needs a
two-hour nap in the afternoon and your toddler wants her library
story-time?
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
156

This question has no right answer; in fact, in the same family, the
answer may change from day to day. However, here are some
guidelines that can help you cope with conflicting demands:
 Try to coordinate naps as much as possible. If your toddler
already gave up her morning nap, you may still manage to get
both children down at the same time in the afternoon. Try
putting Baby down first so you can have a few alone moments
with your toddler. Even a young toddler can be patient when
she knows her turn is coming next.
 If your new baby is a fuss-budget who loses it at the end of
the day when he misses his nap, think of alternative ways to
get your older one to playgroup or story hour. One idea is to
co-op baby-sit with a friend or neighbor: You take the big kids
to nature class on Friday while the other adult watches your
baby. On Tuesday, you trade places, and your buddy drives
the older kids while you watch the littler ones.
 If your older child is in preschool and Baby heads for
dreamland just as you need to walk out the door, try to
nudge Baby’s schedule in a more convenient direction. For
instance, if Baby still wakes up at night to eat, try to postpone
the last pre-morning feeding so that (with luck) he sleeps a
little later and then naps a little later as well.
 Consider getting a front baby-carrier. Babies can sleep quite
happily in these carriers, and they enjoy the movement as
well as the feel and smell of Mom or Dad. With this set-up, you
have your hands free for your toddler.
Here’s the hardest piece of advice to follow: Relax! No matter how
hard you try to juggle naps and toddler time, you can’t always suc-
ceed. The good news is that babies are resilient, and your little
love-bug will thrive even when your schedule doesn’t fall neatly
into place.
Welcoming an Adopted 
Baby into Your Nest
Some newborns arrive by very special delivery: an adoption. If this
is the case in your family, be sure to make your toddler a big part
of this happy event.
Families often face many unknowns when they adopt: When will
the baby arrive? Will we need to travel to another country? How
old will the baby be? Will the baby be healthy?
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 157

When grownups are up to their ears in all the logistics of an adop-
tion, they can overlook the fact that their older children have their
own hopes, fears, and questions about this enormous life change.
And those feelings — like any strong emotions — can affect a tod-
dler’s sleep, both before and after the new baby arrives.
Soothing your toddler’s 
pre-arrival jitters
When you adopt a baby, lots of powerful emotions come into play.
Your toddler soaks up these emotions like a sponge and often
reflects them by resisting bedtime, tossing and turning, having
nightmares, or waking up in the night.
To set her mind at ease, keep her in the loop. She’s going to over-
hear conversations and know that something’s up. When she can’t
find out the truth, she fills in the blanks — and a toddler’s imagina-
tion can conjure up some scary ideas.
So give her the scoop in words she can understand. Create a pic-
ture book (see that section in this chapter) about the new baby.
Tell your toddler in simple terms what to expect. Let her help set
up the crib and go with you when you buy bottles and blankets. To
make being the big kid more palatable, get her something that only
an older child can use — for instance, some washable markers or
modeling clay. But don’t go overboard; material possessions are
not the key to soothing sibling feelings. And be ready with answers
to these questions:
 When is the baby coming? To help in answering this ques-
tion, make a backwards calendar — an open-ended chart to
which you can add days until you get a better idea of baby’s
arrival date. Think of this calendar like the countdown to a
shuttle takeoff. If you think it’ll be two weeks, make 14
squares, the last square holding a picture (if you have one) of
your baby or a picture of some baby item like a crib. Each day,
your older child can put a sticker or make an X in the spot as
you get closer and closer to baby day. If the wait is longer
than you anticipated, add some extra squares.
 How old is the baby? If you know your new baby’s age, tell
your toddler — and point out children about the same age so
she knows how big a baby to expect.
 Where does the baby live now? If your new cherub hails
from a different country, explain this to your toddler. You can
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
158

even get a globe or a world map to point out where the baby
lives now. Perhaps you can try to learn some words in the
baby’s native language or taste some foods from Baby’s 
culture.
 Why is someone else’s baby going to be part of our family?
As toddlers approach 21⁄2 years, their newly sophisticated
thinking can lead to some wild conclusions. Adoption under-
mines one of a child’s most fundamental beliefs — that a family
is safe and unchangeable — because a baby from somebody
else’s family is now part of hers. When you talk to your child
about adopting, repeat again and again that she is part of your
family forever.
Ensuring a happy and peaceful 
homecoming
Any new arrival is a big transition. When Mom’s pregnant, the older
child has plenty of opportunity to get ready; she notices Mom’s
changing body, sees the preparation for the room, and hears the
world talking about this new baby. But in an adoption, you may have
only nine hours, not nine months, to get ready. No matter how much
you try to prepare your toddler, the process will most likely move
rapidly. So be sure to retain as much consistency in your toddler’s
life as possible; it’s one of the keys to a good night’s sleep.
If you need to travel without your child to get the new baby, the
best option is to have one parent stay behind. If this isn’t possible,
prepare your child thoroughly for your departure:
 Let her stay in your house with a sitter or relative if you can.
 If she needs to stay away from home, send her with lots of
comfort items like favorite toys and blankets (and maybe one
of your old sweaters or jackets).
 Leave a photo album and tapes of yourself reading a favorite
story.
 Call her as often as you can.
Expect your toddler’s bedtime rituals to take longer — or even 
disintegrate — when your new baby arrives. When this happens,
be patient and rebuild your routine from the ground up. (See
Chapters 5 and 6 for ideas on encouraging a bedtime routine.)
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 159

Don’t be surprised if your toddler refuses to sleep in her own room.
She’s reacting both to the new baby and to her fears of separation.
One valid philosophy at this time is this: Rules are made to be
broken. So, if you don’t mind having a party of three in your bed,
let your toddler sleep with you for a little while — or put a mat-
tress or sleeping bag on your floor for her.
On the other hand, an established bedtime routine still works best
for many families. (And it helps to have at least one kid who has
the bedtime drill down pat!)
Getting your adopted baby to sleep
Is your adopted child a newborn? If so, the advice in Chapter 4
works just fine. If he’s older than 4 months when you bring him
home, however, you may need to backpedal a bit before you move
forward.
Older adopted infants and toddlers arrive with their own sleep
habits and rituals, and changing them takes time and patience. If
possible, get a detailed description of how your baby’s former
caregivers put him to sleep at night and for naps. Your dark, quiet
bedroom may be just the opposite of the well-lit, noisy room your
little buttercup is used to! Expect some trial and error as you figure
out how to ease your sweetie into a nightlife that’s probably very
different from his old routine.
Daytime stress invades the sleeping hours. As a result, the night
hours can be rocky until your beloved stranger comes to know and
trust you and feels comfortable with the sights, sounds, and smells
of his new home. Your new baby’s age, temperament, and former
environment all influence how quickly he adjusts.
Consult with experts about the issues that adopted babies and
children face. If your new child is a toddler or older, these issues
can include life disruption, grief at losing their former world and
caretakers, and attachment problems. You can find lots of ideas for
dealing with these problems in Adopting For Dummies by Tracy
Barr and Katrina Carlisle (Wiley).
Doubling Your Pleasure
When twins enter your life, here’s our best advice: Open your
mouth and yell, “HELP!”
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
160

Our second piece of advice? Get that help! The first few months
with twins are an endless cycle of feeding, pooping, and crying,
and the best way to keep your sanity is to share the load. If you
can’t rustle up grandparents or other free helpers, an adult helper
is the best investment you can make. If money’s tight, try to find a
reliable teen that can come in after school.
You need all the help you can get, especially at sleepytime. Twins
often have special sleep issues (for instance, many are premature
or smaller-than-average and need extra feedings). They also have
different personalities — even when they’re identical twins — and
that means double trouble when you try to get them on a schedule.
The following sections offer tips on dealing with two sleep-resistant
tots without losing your marbles. In addition, we cover sleep
arrangements as your twins grow and how to cope with twins who
develop at different speeds.
Deciding where your twins will sleep
One friend with twins says, “My babies didn’t sleep well until I
reunited them in the crib. They fell asleep more quickly and slept
longer. I’d find them curled up like little spoons, touching each
other’s hair.”
Some parents find that twins sleep better in the early months when
they share a crib. That’s no surprise — after all, they shared a
much smaller space for nine months! Other parents say their twins
are just as happy in separate beds or even separate rooms.
If your twins do share a crib, make it a temporary arrangement. By
the time your cuties are about 3 months old, they need separate
spaces for safety’s sake. In the meantime, if one is a sleepyhead
and the other is wide awake:
 Tend to the calm baby first. After she’s asleep, you can focus
your attention on your other little rascal.
 Look for clues. Why isn’t your wide-awake twin longing for
bed? Ask yourself these questions:
• Did this baby feed as well as her twin today?
• Did this baby take a longer nap?
• Was this baby more stimulated, making her all wound
up? Or was she under-stimulated, leaving her ready for
action?
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 161

• Is this little darling coming down with a bug?
• Is this twin always the tyrant at bedtime? (If so, it’s a
temperament issue.)
 Make a plan. Depending on the issues you identify, a calming
bath, a feeding, or a long rock with Mommy or Daddy may be
just the ticket.
 Have a backup crib. If your little fussy-face simply refuses to
calm down, pop her into a portable crib so she doesn’t wake
up her sleeping sib.
Balancing the eat-and-sleep 
scheduling teeter-totter
Tiffany’s down! Tamara’s up! Parents of multiples can feel like pup-
pets, with their babies pulling the strings. Everybody agrees that
getting twins on the same schedule is the first step, but that’s
easier said than done.
However, give the schedule a try. Your dynamic duo may surprise
you by going along with the idea. The following two steps make a
good game plan, based on the fact that feeding and sleeping have a
strong connection:
 When your first baby wakes to feed, rouse the other sweetie
as well. It isn’t always easy because a newborn in deep sleep
is totally zonked.
Hint: Take off your snoozer’s swaddling, and put a little bit of
slightly cool water on the bottoms of his feet.
 If you bottle-feed, have another adult feed one twin so you
don’t need to prop a bottle. If you breastfeed, buy a pillow
that allows you to comfortably feed two hungry mouths at
once. (Or your helper can wake up Baby #2 while you’re feed-
ing Baby #1.)
Some parents don’t like the idea of manipulating their babies’ inter-
nal hunger alarms. That idea may be okay in the ideal world, but in
the real world of twins, ideal doesn’t always work! Getting your two
babies on a single track doesn’t hurt them at all. In the long run,
the schedule makes you happier, more rested, and peppier. And
that’s a big advantage for everybody.
If your babies absolutely refuse to synchronize their internal
watches, you may need to take turns with a partner. You can trade
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
162

off nights or do split shifts so each partner gets half a night of
sleep. But if you’re parenting twins on your own, it’s worth a few
difficult nights to switch one of the babies to the other one’s
schedule. Here are some tips for accomplishing that mission:
 Even as newborns your babies have different temperaments,
so try getting the easier-going one to make the switch.
 Start by waking the baby you want to switch 15 minutes ear-
lier (or letting him fuss 15 minutes longer) at each feeding
until you get your little pair synchronized.
Creating a bedtime ritual and 
adapting it for each child
Just like other siblings, twins tend to develop at different rates —
and that’s true for their sleep patterns as well. As a result, you may
need to adjust your bedtime routines (and expectations) to meet
the needs of each twin. If you have a partner, try divvying up the
bedtime ritual so each twin gets individual treatment. Here are two
more tips:
 Nighttime baths are often part of a bedtime ritual, but if your
scallywags end up working each other up into a frenzy of
splashing excitement, consider separate baths or just bathing
them every other night.
 You may find that each twin has a special bedtime book. Con-
sider reading each twin’s particular book to her alone, before
the tuck-in. (Accept the fact that the other twin will likely be
hanging over your shoulder as you read). Then, choose a
book that both will enjoy as the last piece of your routine.
Using separate rooms for older twins
Twins are an endless source of laughter and frustration as they
grow, especially when they start talking. At bedtime they make you
giggle when they chatter like magpies, discussing the day’s events
in baby-talk. Later, they drive you nuts when they’re so full of
beans that they keep each other up.
If your duo gets so rambunctious that sleep is your impossible
dream, you may need to put them in separate rooms for a while.
Don’t be surprised if they object because most twins want to stay
together, at least in the early years.
Chapter 10: Move Over, Darlin’! When a Sibling Enters the Picture 163

If your kids are old enough to really object to being separated, then
they’re old enough for you to set limits — and stick to them. For
instance, tell them that if they’re not quiet after 15 minutes (set a
timer), then one twin will have to move. If neither one volunteers
to leave home base, you can literally draw straws. You may hear
some loud objections, but if you stand firm, the separation will prob-
ably last only a few days. Most twins figure out what they want (to
be together or to be apart at night) and tailor their behavior to
achieve their goal — and yours!

and Sitters
In This Chapter
 Linking daytime care and nighttime sleep
 Considering the choices: Away from home or in the home
 Keeping your focus on sleep and safety issues
 Creating and maintaining a positive atmosphere for your toddler
P
olly hangs out with Grandma on weekdays while Mommy
works. Damon’s parents hire a sitter twice a month so they
can enjoy a romantic evening. And Juan and Manuel started in
childcare when they were 2 months old; their parents say, “We
need to work two jobs if we’re going to send twins to Harvard!”
What do these families have in common? Each one calls on other
people to help care for Baby — preschool teachers, child-care
providers, relatives, or sitters. And each family’s extra dream-team
members play a big role in how well their little ones sleep at night.
In this chapter, we look at how daytime stints at school, Nana’s
home, or a sitter’s house can mesh with your sleep routines. We
also explain how to reduce separation-related sleep upsets by
choosing your child’s day-care providers wisely, by communicating
your baby’s sleep issues to them, and by enlisting their help for
your wee one’s transition.

Understanding How Caregivers
Affect the Sleep Routine
Getting your honey bun to sleep is tough enough when all the stars
are perfectly aligned and you’re the only one calling the shots. Add
another person or two to the mix, and you can see why even a good
sleeper can throw you a curve at beddy-bye time.
Choosing the best child-care situation for your family takes some
thought and homework — and you’re not finished when you’ve
made that decision. You still need to be in constant communica-
tion with your caregiver to make sure everyone’s giving your child
the same messages about napping and sleeping through the night.
This section provides some insights into the benefits of each type
of care and the sleep issues that may arise.
Preschool and day-care centers
Preschools and child-care centers are popular choices for lots of
good reasons. In good programs, children get a happy learning
experience and a chance to socialize. Good preschools and day-
care centers are licensed and supervised by the state; many seek
out state or national accreditation. And you don’t need to worry
about that morning call from Nana or the nanny saying, “I can’t
come today — I’m sick!”
However, if you pick a preschool or day care, be ready for some
fussy days and sleep-deprived nights. To understand why, think
back to your first day in kindergarten — or even your first day at a
new job. You worried, “Who’s going to be in charge of me?” “When’s
lunch?” “Where do I go to the bathroom?” No matter how young or
old you are, learning the ropes at a new place is a challenge.
This challenge is even more stressful for a tot in preschool or day
care because he adds an elephant-sized worry: Is Mommy or Daddy
really coming back for me? If your tyke is 12 months to 2 years old —
when the fear of parting really sinks its claws in — he probably
worries that your bye-bye wave is the last he’ll ever see of you.
All of these worries can play havoc with your child’s sleep. Here
are some possible problems to anticipate:
 Napping at school: When your child is happily playing in the
sandbox or painting a masterpiece, he can be the model stu-
dent. But when the teacher turns down the lights and says,
“Naptime,” you can bet that your tot’s thoughts go directly to
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
166

you and when (or whether!) you’re coming back. Naps at
school can be a tough time — especially if he worries that
he’ll miss your return. He may respond by fighting sleep.
 Napping at home: Even good nappers may have difficulty at
home after they start school. Schedules are different, and they
get used to sleeping in a group. They may even fight that after-
noon nap on the weekend because it takes them away from
Mommy or Daddy. (See our “Weekend Waker” story later in
this chapter.)
 Nighttime sleep: Leaving home is a big step and a big separa-
tion, but a child who seems fine with daytime separations may
fight sleep at night simply because it’s another separation. Until
your child begins to feel really comfortable at school, you may
find yourself dealing with some nighttime awakenings.
Because separation anxiety can be in full gear at this age, we rec-
ommend waiting till your tot is 2 years or older if preschool is only
a socializing experience. Toddlers younger than 2 years don’t need
to be in a preschool program for socialization — a play group, play
dates with the neighborhood kids, or a toddler gym or music class
can give these toddlers all the social skills they need.
Chapter 11: Your Dream Team Grows 167
Stories from the crib:
The weekend waker
Raphael and Luisa found a great preschool for Julia, their 2-year-old. Julia played
hard and happily all morning, and the staff reported, “She’s always one of the first
to fall asleep at naptime.”
Weekends, however, were another story. Julia napped just fine in the mornings, but
in the afternoon she popped up like a Jack-in-the-Box. This perplexed her parents.
What turned their weekday napper into a perpetual motion machine on Saturday
and Sunday?
Julia’s preschool director explained that this pattern is quite common in preschool-
ers. Weekends at home with Mommy and Daddy are just too exciting to waste on
naps, even for the most frazzled toddlers. At school, on the other hand, a long snooze
helps to pass the time until Mom or Dad shows up.
When Raphael and Luisa understood why Julia shunned weekend naps, they
decided on a compromise. Rather than insisting on an afternoon nap on weekends,
they scheduled some quiet downtime. Often, as she listened to the soft music,
assembled puzzles with Mommy and Daddy, and listened to her favorite stories,
Julia would doze off for 30 minutes or so — just long enough to recharge her bat-
teries so she could enjoy her evening with her parents.

However, working parents may not have the luxury of waiting for
the perfect moment. If that’s your situation, don’t worry. Your little
one may have a few rocky days and nights, but there are ways to
minimize those slumber setbacks (we cover them later in this
chapter as well as in the age-related chapters in Part II). These
tricks also work great with older tots who still find it tough to say
“Goodbye” to Mom or Dad.
In-home caregivers
Home care is a great alternative for babies and toddlers who may
be intimidated by the hustle and bustle of a large center. Younger
ones also benefit from the consistency that a single caregiver pro-
vides, and this can mean better sleep for both of you. You have a
few options: a family member, a nanny, or an au pair. We cover all
three in this section.
The family affair
It’s a match made in heaven when Grandma and Grandpa — or any
other relative you love and trust — watches your little munchkin
for you. The love connection between your sweetie and her family
members is powerful insurance that she’ll be happy and safe.
However, no one’s perfect — not even your mom or dad. If you
want your little sunflower to be safe and well-rested in the day so
she can sleep stress-free at night, know what you’re getting into
when you ask your parents to pinch-hit for you.
Problems can crop up when you make babysitting a family affair —
and these problems can create cracks in your carefully-crafted sleep
routine. Here are three all-too-common hitches in the get-along:
 Free can come with strings attached. Often, family members
baby-sit free of charge. That sweet deal saves you a bundle of
cash, but a volunteer who doesn’t follow your game plan is
hard to criticize.
 Different styles can cause friction. Grandma’s or Grandpa’s
deep emotional attachment can sometimes lead to a strong
reaction to your parenting style — especially when your folks
don’t agree with your sleep strategies.
 History repeats itself. Remember the mistakes Mom or Dad
made with you? Most likely, they’ll make the same mistakes
with your toddler. If they do, you’ll need to decide whether to
lay down the law or grin and bear it.
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family

A few examples: What will you do if your mom still insists on
washing your tot’s mouth out with soap when she says a bad
word? What if your dad vetoes healthful, whole-grain peanut-
butter-and-banana sandwiches in favor of marshmallow fluff?
Before asking your mom or dad (or another relative) to sit for you,
think through your decision and be sure your relationship is strong
enough to handle the sticky issues. If it is, go for it. If not, paying
extra money for a sitter may be a wiser choice.
A nanny or au pair
When you’re choosing a person to care for your angel in your
home, weigh the differences between nannies and au pairs.
A nanny comes with many built-in advantages and a few drawbacks:
 If you use a good agency, the greatest advantage is that your
nanny is already well-versed in bedtime safety rules.
 A major drawback is that a trained nanny may also feel she
has the know-how, so she may try to override your rules.
Although kids are pretty smart and quickly pick up on differ-
ent standards, big differences in sleep expectations can take a
toll on their sleep.
For instance, if you and your nanny differ about how long (if
at all) a baby should cry before falling asleep, you can bet
your diaper bag that your child’s sleep routine will suffer.
Au pair is French for on par or equal to. In plain English, an au pair
is usually a woman from another country who stays with a host
family for free (and gets a little money, too) in exchange for child-
care and sometimes light housekeeping. When comparing au pairs
with nannies, these are some differences:
 A typical au pair is young, inexperienced, and has little or no
training in child development. Think of au pairs more as work-
ing tourists than childcare experts.
 These young adults have their own needs that may cause
some bumps. For example, they may become homesick or find
the nightlife in your hometown a little too appealing.
 Because au pairs come from different cultures, their ideas of
child-raising may not mesh with yours.
 Au pairs are cheaper — a big plus if money is tight.
Chapter 11: Your Dream Team Grows 169

 Like nannies, they can give your little cherub one-on-one
attention and cater to your nap and bedtime schedules.
 Unlike a nanny, an au pair generally doesn’t have a predeter-
mined idea of how to get your little one to sleep.
Her adaptability can be good news and bad news. You can
explain your bedtime rules to her and she’ll agree to them.
But she may have trouble following through because of her
inexperience.
Au pairs are great if you use them as intended — family helpers who
fill in when Mom and Dad aren’t available. We don’t recommend
the use of an au pair for full-time care when a child is under 3 years
of age. If the child is truly attached to the au pair (which you want!),
the sense of loss when she leaves can feel like a death — the com-
plete disappearance of a loved one.
Hiring Help that Supports 
Your Sleep Strategies
Angie sleeps like an angel after a day at her new day-care center,
but Kyle’s bedtime ritual is falling apart. Roberto doesn’t nap for
his new sitter and he’s a real bear at bedtime. Dustin willingly
grabs his blankie when the nanny says, “It’s naptime,” and then
goes off to bed happily for Mommy at night.
Why do some kids make the transition to day care without a glitch
in their naps or nighttime dozing while other kids go off the rails?
One reason is that kids sleep well only when they like, understand,
and feel safe with the people in charge of them — which is why
successful sleep can hinge on finding just the right setting or
person to provide day care for your tot.
Looking for the right day care
To make your child’s days easier and keep your nights quieter,
seek out a program that’s sensitive to his needs. Finding the per-
fect place takes time, but it’s well worth the effort.
What should you look for at each school? First, make sure the
director appears knowledgeable and available; look for someone
who can support you with reliable information when your sweetie
pie has an issue. Next, focus on the issues that are deal breakers
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family

for you. Choosing Childcare For Dummies by Ann Douglas (Wiley)
covers this topic in great detail, but here are few pointers that per-
tain to sleep:
 Say “No” to any program with a drop-and-run policy. This
policy means that the staff discourages you from staying
while your child gets acquainted. Instead, they want you to
simply walk away — even when your toddler struggles and
cries. This scenario is likely to cause a strong negative reac-
tion (can you blame him?). And it can lead to bedtime clingi-
ness, disruptive behavior, and nighttime awakenings.
 Ask specific questions about naptime requirements. If your
child is still an infant, make sure there’s enough staff so your
baby can conk out on his own schedule. If your toddler still
takes two naps a day, what sort of accommodation (if any) is
the staff willing to make when the rest of the class takes just
one nap? Note: An alternative may be to have the toddler join
the infant class for the morning snooze.
 Ask what happens when Junior is no longer napping. Even
children younger than 2 are sometimes ready to forgo all
naps. Find out what sort of accommodations the school is
willing to make for a non-napper of any age.
If possible, leave your little darling home when you take your tours
(unless you still have an infant trussed to your chest). A mobile
baby or toddler can distract you from your mission, and an older
child can get confused about which school will be his.
Considering a sitter
When family members can’t pitch in, you may need to look outside
your home for someone who can give you a break from the rigors
of raising a child. Sitters aren’t just a luxury; they’re an important
part of the picture for families with young children. Using a sitter
allows you to get out in the world of fun, away from your work at
home or the office. And this break provides an important opportu-
nity for you and your partner to reconnect over something other
than rice cereal and strained plums.
Picking the right candidate
Although it’s a favorite plot for offbeat television movies, few
babysitters actually turn out to be crazed axe murderers! However,
picking a sitter you can trust to keep your child safe, happy, and
sweetly asleep at night can be a real challenge.
Chapter 11: Your Dream Team Grows 171

The best choice, obviously, is a highly trusted friend or family
member. But if your pals and kin are off at the movies or out snow-
boarding on the weekends, where else can you turn?
The simplest answer is to hire a neighborhood teen who’s looking
for some extra spending money. But before you think about trusting
your angel to the kid down the street, ask yourself these questions:
 How old is old enough? Leaving your baby or toddler with a
child under 12 years old is unsafe (and illegal in some parts of
the country). But 12 isn’t necessarily a magic number because
lots of brand-new teens are totally unprepared for the respon-
sibility of caring for a little tyke. On the other hand, some 20-
year-olds can’t be trusted with a Pekingese! So go by maturity,
not just by age.
 Does your child have special needs? If your child takes spe-
cial medications, uses a breathing machine, or has feeding
issues or serious behavior problems, don’t expect a teen 
to cope.
Asking lots of questions to make sure Sweetie will be safe
A good boss asks plenty of good questions at a job interview. In
this case, you’re the boss — and there’s no more important job
than watching your wee one and staying on top of her schedule
and nighttime safety. So be sure to give your wanna-be sitter a
good (although friendly) grilling. Some key questions to ask:
 How much experience do you have? Look for a candidate
who’s already trained on someone else’s kids. If possible,
check with those families to see whether the sitter did a good
job. For instance, did the sitter follow the family’s sleeping
routine, or did the parents come home to find their child
sleeping on the floor clutching a video game?
 Did you ever take a babysitting class? If the answer is “No”
but you like the sitter, consider offering to pay for a course (as
well as paying her for the hours in class). It’s a small invest-
ment to make for a safe sitter, and it demonstrates your own
seriousness about his work. Community centers, YMCAs, and
the Girl Scouts of America routinely offer these classes.
 Do you have younger brothers or sisters? This qualification
isn’t a must — but older sibs often are pros with diapers, bot-
tles, and bedtime stories.
 Can you handle a houseful? Give your potential candidate a
couple of what-ifs. For instance, what if the baby is screaming
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
172

for a nighttime bottle at the same time the 3-year-old needs to
use the potty? Your candidate’s responses show you how
quickly your candidate can think on his feet and how well he
can cope with your mischievous herd.
If your candidate passes your interview with flying colors, make your
next step a test run. Pay your sitter to watch your child for a few
hours while you’re at home. After the initial getting-to-know-you
period and a thorough review of the house rules, give the sitter a
little breathing room; let her handle everything — diapers, feed-
ings, and a nap or bedtime.
By keeping your distance, you give your sitter and your tot a chance
to size each other up while you check out the sitter’s skills. Listen
to the conversations and observe the interactions. If your child
appears comfortable, resist the urge to hover (it sends the mes-
sage that you think something’s amiss). Obviously, you want to
quickly intervene if necessary, so find something to do like cooking
up a pot of stew in the kitchen while they play in the nearby den.
After you’ve handed over the greenbacks and waved goodbye, do a
gut check:
 Did it go well?
 Did your tot warm up to the sitter?
 Is a little voice inside you saying something’s not quite right?
Go with your instincts — you’ll never have fun out on the town if
you’re anxious about your sitter.
Laying out the Sleep Routine
Families get used to nap routines — you naturally stick with what
works. But if your angel’s at day care or home with a sitter, you’ll
need to make some adjustments. This section explains how to get
everyone in synch.
In day care
If you hate to see your toddler’s morning nap go but the staff at his
program thinks he’s ready for this switch, sit down with them and
talk it over. Together, you can work out a plan for making this
Chapter 11: Your Dream Team Grows 173

change as painless as possible. Base your plan on the staff’s feed-
back as well as your own observations. Here are some tips:
 Find out why the staff thinks it’s time. Maybe it takes the
staff 30 minutes to get Junior down for a nap that lasts just 15
minutes — or perhaps they find that his little catnap at 10
a.m. keeps him from getting good sleep at 1 p.m.
 Look to the bedtime hour. If your baby’s bedtime at home
has shifted (maybe he’s now happy and playful until 8 p.m.
instead of zonking out at 7), it may be a clue that his nap
needs are changing.
 Give it a try. After a few days, the staff may tell you that your
sweetie is now sleeping a full two hours at one stretch instead
of 15 minutes in the morning and 45 minutes in the afternoon.
This change is a pretty strong sign that you made the right
decision. And a longer nap in the afternoon may have added
benefits: You get to pick up a well-rested, less cranky child.
A different problem arises if you want your toddler to skip a nap
that’s part of the program’s schedule. We generally think parental
instincts are worth gold, but in this case, the teachers’ or care-
givers’ instincts may be more on the mark. This is the time for a
little introspection on your part.
If your goal is to get your exhausted toddler down right after
dinner so you can have a whole evening alone after a long day at
work, you may be doing your child a real disservice. Your child
needs to sleep at school and go to bed a bit later at night for sev-
eral reasons:
 A good program is busy, exciting — and tiring! Often, your
little one needs an afternoon siesta just to keep up. If he doesn’t
get it, he may be cranky or weepy and have trouble coping
later on in the day.
 An overtired toddler spells trouble at twilight. Little rug rats
who don’t get forty winks in the afternoon can be too stimu-
lated to unwind (putting a real wrinkle in your evening plans!).
 After a good nap at school, your little one is rested enough to
enjoy a bedtime routine that allows for a lovely reconnection
with you at the end of the day.
If your day-care program expects your toddler to snooze for two or
three hours, it’s fair to ask for a shorter naptime. Some toddlers
like to sack out for hours at a stretch, but many others fancy a
shorter rest. If you do your homework and pick an understanding
and flexible program, you can probably work out a compromise
with the staff.
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
174

Of course, some children really don’t require naps. If your child
falls into that category, find a program that provides a non-napping
room with a staff member who offers quiet toys and activities until
the other children are up.
At home
With an in-home sitter, aim for consistency in your tot’s sleep rou-
tine, but don’t fret if you’re not always on the same page (or even
the same paragraph) with your caregiver. Adapting to different 
routines isn’t traumatic for your sweetie as long as the schedule
doesn’t spin out of control. Here’s how to combine consistency
with flexibility:
 Nap times: You can’t cast naptime in stone, but do expect any
caregiver to stick closely to your schedule. A half-hour varia-
tion or a once-a-week change of schedule doesn’t hurt, but a
different nap time every day throws a baby’s life out of kilter.
Note: Be sure to spell out your child’s usual naptimes in writ-
ing so your sitter has a benchmark.
 Sleepy-time rules: Do you let your little pumpkin cry himself
to sleep or do you pick him up at the first whimper? Do you
put your toddler down precisely at 8 each night, or do you
allow some flexibility? No matter which strategy you choose,
encourage the caregiver to march to the same drummer.
Keeping your Baby 
Safe and Happy
No matter who sits for your children at your home — big brother,
the cheerleader down the street, Grandma, or your best friend —
you need to give them tools for safe sitting and the info they need
to keep your sweetie cozy. For safety’s sake:
 Make two charts, a contacts/emergency information chart and
a routine and scheduling chart, and show them to your sitter.
Be sure to include your first and last name — you’d be sur-
prised how many sitters don’t know these basics! (See the
Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for a good go-by.)
 Don’t take safety rules for granted. Your sitter may say, “I raised
six children — I think I know how to keep a baby safe!” But he
may not, especially regarding sleep. Be ready to take a stand, lov-
ingly but firmly, on sleep safety issues — and spell them out in
your instructions (see the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book).
Chapter 11: Your Dream Team Grows 175

For you baby’s comfort, cover these bases before you leave:
 Set out in plain sight everything your sitter will need including
pajamas, diapers, snacks, and toys.
 If your sitter is new to your house, offer a quick tour of every
room that’s not off limits.
 Make sure your sitter knows how to: use the television, turn
alarms on or off, use the microwave, and handle baby moni-
tors or other equipment. The more comfortable your sitter is
with the ins and outs of your home, the more relaxed your
baby will be.
Managing Toddler Anxiety
As babies and toddlers start to figure out their world, they can
become little worrywarts — and these worries can deeply affect
their behaviors, especially sleep. So take the time to help your
child transition to new places and new people; it’ll give you a blue-
chip payoff in the end.
Earlier in this chapter, we detail how to acclimate your child to 
a sitter in your home. But adjusting to a whole new physical 
environment — a day-care center, preschool, or sitter’s home —
takes a bit more time and a little ingenuity. This section gives you
some tips for the transition.
Easing her into day care
Be ready for a few sleepless nights before and after your toddler
starts preschool or day care. To ease your toddler’s anxieties, do a
little prep work and be on hand when she takes this big step:
 Be a shutterbug. Stop by your child’s new program before start-
ing day and bring a camera. Take pictures of the play tables, the
swings, the bathroom, the staff members, the lunchroom, the
cots — anything that gives your little snookums a sneak pre-
view of her new home-away-from-home. This way, she knows
what to expect. (You can even make a book about the new
program — see Chapter 10 for a variation on this theme.)
 Create a memory. Make a little photo album of family pictures
that your child can take with her each day. (Include Spot and
Fluffy, too.) Use photos you can replace in case they get lost.
 When you arrive, plan to stick around to help your little
angel get acquainted with her new friends. In fact, see
Part III: Sleep Decisions that Involve the Whole Family 
176

whether you can slowly increase your pumpkin’s time at the
center (check the steps below for a smooth transition).
A good program will be happy to go along with your step-by-
step approach to ease your tot into a full day. If a program
doesn’t let you do it, find another place for your pumpkin.
 Never ever sneak out without saying “Goodbye” to your
child no matter how tempting it is. Even if your goodbye is
mingled with tears, your child needs to know that you’re
coming back; you aren’t just disappearing.
If your little cherub is starting a full-time program:
1. Bring her (and plan to stay at the program yourself) for a
couple of hours the first day.
2. Have her stay progressively longer each day (and stay at
the program yourself). As she gets more comfortable with
her new world, leave the room for increasing amounts 
of time.
Chapter 11: Your Dream Team Grows 177
Stories from the crib:
Schooldays, night daze
Andy’s mom, Heather, expected preschool to be a piece of cake. “He never fussed
when sitters came,” she says, “and I had him in childcare for months with no prob-
lems.” But while other children cheerfully said “Bye-bye!” and marched into the
classroom each morning, Andy grabbed at Heather’s legs and said, “No! I want to go
home!” At night, he couldn’t fall asleep, and he didn’t want Heather to leave the room.
The director of Andy’s preschool explained that even children who do fine with sit-
ters or child-care providers can be overwhelmed by preschool — especially when
they’re in the grips of separation anxiety. To help Andy cope, Heather rearranged her
work schedule so she could spend a week in the classroom with Andy, and his
teachers went out of their way to welcome him. Soon Andy was one of the gang —
and he started sleeping soundly again.
Latoya had the opposite experience. Her daughter, Lydia, appeared to love school.
At home, however, bedtimes became a big struggle. Lydia also started getting up in
the middle of the night and asking for water or a hug.
Latoya told her pediatrician about the problem, and he clued her in: Lydia loved
school — but she also hated being away from Mommy. That conflict, he said,
intruded on Lydia’s sleep. When Latoya understood the connection, she talked with
Lydia about her big conflicting emotions. She said, “I know you have fun at school,
but I also know that you miss Mommy.” Just having Mom put her feelings into words
made Lydia feel better and helped her fall asleep more easily.

3. Stay for nap-time the first day. When you help the care-
giver get your little one down, you reassure your tot that
sleeping at school is okay.
4. Let the caregiver put your baby down the next day, but
stay close by. Again, this gives the strong message that
she’s safe sleeping there.
5. Do the vanishing act when your child has a comfy feeling
at school. At this point, you can say “Goodbye” with a
quick kiss and a cuddle.
This process can take a week or longer, so keep your schedule open!
Playing musical houses successfully
In a perfect world, Mary Poppins shows up every morning on your
doorstep. In the real world, getting anyone to show up can be hard.
You may need to cobble together a week’s worth of childcare by
using sitters some days and day care or preschool on others.
Babies are resilient, and they can handle this game of musical
houses. But to make it easier, try these approaches:
 Keep your baby in one place for as many days in a row as
you can. For instance, see whether Grandma can take the
Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday shift and Aunt Rita the
Thursday-Friday shift.
 For naps, play it by ear. Your tot may nap at different times in
different settings and do just fine. But if the nap schedule dis-
solves into complete chaos, try to get it back on track. One
idea: Can at least one sitter come to your house to cut down
on disruptive moves?
 When your baby reaches the 15-month mark, introduce a
calendar to help her know where she’s going. Make a simple
strip with 2-inch blocks to represent each day. In each block,
stick a photo of that day’s sitter. Make photocopies of the
strips, placing one on your fridge and one at each sitter’s
house. If a change occurs, simply make a new strip.

ife takes lots of interesting (and sometimes surpris-
ing) twists and turns. Often, we celebrate happy
changes — a new job, an exciting move, a wedding in the
family. Other times, unpleasant surprises like illness or
divorce give us a jolt. Many changes — birthdays, the 
ﬁrst day of kindergarten — are predictable. Others, like
the arrival of a baby weeks ahead of schedule, can take 
us completely by surprise.
In this section, we look at three special and challenging
situations and how all three affect your tot’s sleep (and
yours). In Chapter 12, we talk about how to cope if your
love-bug arrives before her due date, and we explain why
your early bird keeps you awake round-the-clock (and why
you won’t be getting to sleep for a while). In Chapter 13,
we offer advice about your baby’s or toddler’s snifﬂes and
rashes as well as chronic medical issues that can disrupt
your tyke’s sleep. And in Chapter 14, we talk about keep-
ing your little one sleeping like an angel even if big or little
life changes have your household in a tizzy.

If your baby made an early appearance, you have some extra 
challenges with parenting — and one of those challenges is to help
your sweetie sleep. Early birds have many of the same feeding and
sleeping issues as full-term newborns, but they also have the extra
job of playing catch up. So a preterm baby sleeps, eats, and acts
like a newborn for an extra-long time. In addition, some preterm
babies have health issues, ranging from mild to very serious, that
can greatly affect a family’s sleep. The good news is that premature
babies, if healthy enough, finally outgrow that first stage of non-
stop wake-up calls.
In this chapter, we outline the three reasons early birds keep 
their parents awake and tell you how long it may take to get your
nightlife back to normal. We also give you our insight on adjusting
your life to meet your little one’s needs while keeping your sanity!
Finally, we give you a full rundown on how to keep your premature
baby safe — a vital part of parenting these wee ones — and share 
a sleep-promoting trick that comforts your baby as you get her 
to sleep.

Noting Age-Specific Problems 
in Premature Births
The term premature covers lots of territory. Babies typically stay in
the womb for 37 to 42 weeks, and anything before that is preterm or
premature. (Anything after 42 weeks is postmature, but modern deliv-
ery methods have sharply reduced the chance of that situation.)
In the womb: Stages of development
About one in ten babies arrives early, but the issues you encounter
as a parent depend largely on how early. A quick look at a baby’s
development shows why.
Prenatal (before birth) growth takes place in neat thirds, with dra-
matic changes occurring in each trimester:
 In the first trimester (the beginning to 12 weeks of preg-
nancy): The fertilized egg transforms into a body with all 
of its organs.
 In the second trimester (13 to 26 weeks): The newly-formed
organs start to do their jobs. For instance, the lungs that
developed at the end of the first trimester don’t start to
breathe until the end of the second trimester.
 In the third trimester (27 to 40 weeks): A baby’s body stock-
piles nutrients, fat, and water in preparation for life in the out-
side world. His body also adds the finishing touches so that
every part — lungs, heart, even skin — can function from the
get-go. By his arrival day, he can maintain his temperature, eat
on his own, and breathe without any reminders.
When a baby arrives before the end of the third trimester, his body
still undergoes the third-trimester changes, but some or all of them
happen outside the womb. That adjustment is a challenge, espe-
cially for a very premature baby. Note: The word premature carries
many meanings, so it’s more helpful to look at the degrees of pre-
maturity, which depend on the length of the pregnancy:
 Birth at 24 to 26 weeks (severe prematurity): A baby born 
at the start of the third trimester can have serious medical
problems (particularly if his lungs don’t work well). These
problems can include:
• Very serious breathing troubles that require ventilator
support and high concentrations of oxygen
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
182

• Frequent and potentially serious infections
• Bleeding in parts of the brain; the more premature 
the birth, the more likely this complication is
With or without these serious medical challenges, the
severely premature baby still grows. In fact, growth is 
the most powerful tool he has to help him develop into a
healthy infant.
 Birth from 27 to 29 weeks (moderately severe prematurity):
A baby who arrives this early still has big issues, but the
chance of serious problems drops significantly. These prob-
lems can include:
• Very serious trouble breathing
• Potentially serious infections
• Bleeding in the brain
 Birth from 30 to 34 weeks (moderate to mild prematurity):
By 30 weeks of pregnancy, the chances that a baby can
breathe well and avoid serious illness improve greatly, and
these chances improve further with every week of pregnancy.
Better lung power means better health in several ways:
• Normal, calm, and effective breathing can define the
overall medical course of a premature infant.
• When lungs function normally, the risk of severe infec-
tions or bleeding in the brain drops dramatically.
• Good lung function allows the premature baby to devote
valuable energy to the key goal of growing.
 Birth from 35 to 36 weeks (near-term): Although a baby is
technically premature at this point, his lungs are so mature
that serious issues are unlikely. However, three key challenges
still remain (see the next section for more details on these
issues):
• Maintaining his own temperature at 98.6 degrees
• Eating without extra help
• Breathing in a regular, uninterrupted rhythm
Each baby is an individual, of course, and a small number of 
25-weekers have no serious medical issues or long-term special
needs. And needless to say, illness is a risk even for full-term
infants. But to a large degree, the length of your baby’s stay in 
the womb affects his health — and sleep — issues.
Chapter 12: Sleep Tips for Families with Premature Babies 183

Out of the womb: The catch-up game
If you’re tall, short, left-handed, or freckled, those traits last 
forever — but being premature is a temporary condition! Like other
babies, preterm babies can experience long-term health issues,
especially if they’re very premature. But prematurity ends as soon
as Baby catches up on the developmental steps she skipped in the
womb. One year past their due dates, a healthy premature infant is
no different from a healthy full-term infant in many ways.
Unfortunately, illness is a big threat to a premature baby, and the
smaller your baby, the more medical challenges you’re likely to
face. But small size, in the absence of health complications, may
not cause long-term problems.
If your tot has serious medical issues (for instance lung, brain, or
immune system problems), she’ll probably spend time — maybe
weeks or months — in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).
Even preterm babies without serious medical problems often need
to stay in the hospital till they get big enough for the outside world.
After your baby is medically stable, your journey toward taking her
home takes a big step forward. She’s likely to be ready for the big
day when she reaches the three key goals (we note these in the
previous section about birth after 35 to 36 weeks of pregnancy):
 She can eat like a pro. At first, your little cherub may need a
feeding tube because she has trouble swallowing. To be safe
at home, she first needs to master the skill of feeding from
breast or bottle.
 She’s not chilling out. Keeping warm is harder than it sounds
because the body needs to do two jobs: generate heat (the
brains’ job) and keep it inside (the skin’s job). Both of them
are big challenges when prematurity enters the picture.
The smaller your baby, the more surface area she has in rela-
tion to her size — and the easier it is for heat to escape from
her body. When she weighs 4 pounds, her skin is probably suf-
ficiently thick and well-developed to keep heat in or let it radi-
ate away from her body. At the same time, her brain figures
out when she needs more or less heat and then adjusts her
skin to keep her at a cozy 98.6 degrees in a warm room.
 She gets the art of breathing down pat. Your baby’s lungs
don’t start working until the third trimester, and her brain
doesn’t master the art of breathing reliably until about the
35th week of development. This late development makes
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
184

sense because Mom provides for Baby’s every need in the
womb — breathing isn’t necessary.
The late development also explains why babies born before 
35 weeks run the risk of forgetting to breathe. When that 
happens, they need a little stimulation — a back rub, a tap on
the foot, or even a little extra oxygen — to get back on track.
Your baby stays in the hospital until her brain and lungs figure
out the ins and outs of breathing, and when you welcome her
home she may still be on medications and a breathing moni-
tor. These precautions ensure that she takes every breath just
when she needs to.
When you bring your baby home, she continues playing catch up.
In the next few sections, we cover her needs from that first day at
home until the day her body successfully completes the steps it
skipped before birth. For more detailed information on sleep after
that milestone, check out the chapters in Part II.
Understanding the Special Needs
of Premature Babies
The primary reason your little honey bun keeps you bouncing out
of bed so often is that he has to get used to the world after being in
your womb.
Life in the womb is like a stay in a 4-star hotel because Mom meets
so many of her developing baby’s needs. Check out the womb’s
unique features:
 It keeps the temperature at 98.6 with no effort on Baby’s part.
 It offers the oxygen Baby needs without using his lungs.
 It serves up his meals without any need to eat them.
 It manages crucial chemical reactions via the placenta, which
also takes out the trash by removing waste products.
 It lets your sweetie sleep and develop with little stress or noise.
Birth propels your baby into a journey of increasing independence —
a tough road at first for a premature baby. Your cherub suddenly 
has to maintain his own temperature, breathe, eat, pee, poop, and
manage all his own chemistry. That’s a big leap for a newborn —
especially for one who shows up early. He also faces these three big
challenges when it comes to sleep:
Chapter 12: Sleep Tips for Families with Premature Babies 185

 He needs to play catch up. Sleep develops over time — just
like organs, hair, and those cute little fingernails. Even a full-
term baby has immature sleep patterns, so preterm babies
need extra weeks to catch up for missed time in the womb.
(See the previous section for more on this catch-up period.)
 He has a giant appetite. For the first few weeks or months,
your little rosebud needs to eat like a sumo wrestler — and
that means more wake-up calls.
 Medical issues, a serious risk for preterm babies, can also
disrupt his sleep. Resolving these problems adds to sleep
challenges when the big homecoming day arrives.
In the following sections, we look more closely at how these three
issues can make preterm babies a handful for Mom and Dad. But
don’t despair; later in this chapter we offer tips for getting through
those first few months.
Growing into a sleep pattern
Just like a full-termer, your preterm baby starts out with an imma-
ture sleep pattern. She eventually develops a more mature one, but
she does it just a little more slowly than a full-term baby.
The development of sleep patterns
All newborns have sleep cycles that consist of the following forms:
 Active sleep: Later in infancy, your baby will develop Rapid
Eye Movement sleep (REM), a special phase of sleep where
many dreams occur. But before the mature REM phase devel-
ops, this phase is called active sleep. It’s a large part of sleep
for newborns and especially for premature infants.
 Quiet sleep: Another immature state, quiet sleep, later
matures into the stages of sleep (see Chapter 2 for info on
these 4 stages). In newborns — and especially premature
babies — these stages aren’t yet distinct.
 Indeterminate sleep: This third type of immature sleep is
partway between active and quiet, deep sleep.
Your preterm baby’s sleep and a full-termer’s are very different
because your little love-bug starts out sleeping like a baby who’s
still in the womb. Here’s how her sleep develops before and after
birth (we give you a quick overview here, but see Chapter 2 for
more info):
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
186

 Near the start of her third trimester, your baby’s brain starts
cycling between wakefulness and sleep, although much of her
sleep is the active form. At this point, the lines between sleep
stages (see the previous bullets) are blurry. Your sweetie
really isn’t awake, so we don’t know why she starts to snooze!
If your sweetums arrived very early (prior to 30 weeks of preg-
nancy), she spends about 2⁄3 of her first days after birth in
active sleep.
 In the third trimester and for some time after birth, a baby
briefly experiences indeterminate sleep, cycling from active to
quiet and back to active sleep. She is also fully awake at times,
and sleep probably plays a bigger role in her well-being.
 By the time she reaches her expected due date — that is, 
the date Mom’s pregnancy would have reached 40 weeks — 
a baby spends only half her time in active sleep (an early 
version of REM — see Chapter 2 for details). As active sleep
diminishes, the sleep stages begin to develop, and alert wake-
fulness continues to advance.
 When a baby passes her expected due date, she develops
more mature sleep patterns — just like a full-term newborn. 
In just a few months, her four stages of sleep (see Chapter 2
for more info) become better defined, and she develops a
sleep/wake pattern that’s very much like an adult’s. As these
changes take place, sleep plays a more mature role in forming
memories and promoting healthy brain function.
Reaching sleep maturity
After your sweetie reaches her full-term due date — if she doesn’t
have significant medical problems — her sleep patterns start to
follow the same path as a full-term baby’s. So, if she arrived four
weeks early, you can figure on an extra month of newborn-style
sleep. If he arrived ten weeks early, you’re in for a longer haul.
Of course, premature babies (just like full-term babies) are unique
little individuals, so some develop regular sleep habits faster than
others. Follow the advice in Chapters 4 through 8 for advice on a
baby’s age-specific sleep issue, simply adjusting for your baby’s
weeks of prematurity.
To know what age range to go by:
 Subtract the number of weeks your baby was premature from
her actual age; use that adjusted age to anticipate what to
expect sleep-wise. (For example, if your little tootsie came a
month early, she’s ready for the steps we outline for 6-month-
olds when she’s about 7 months old.)
Chapter 12: Sleep Tips for Families with Premature Babies 187

 If your baby was severely premature, consider using the date
of her discharge from the hospital as the starting point for her
development. (This date is usually well past her due date.)
Bulking up
Preterm babies make NFL players look like picky eaters. Like full-
term infants, premature infants eat every 1 1⁄2 to 4 hours at birth,
but they tend to prefer 1 1⁄2- to 2-hour feeding intervals.
At first glance, your pint-sized sweetie’s giant appetite may seem
strange. But the reason is simple: A full-term baby spends that
third trimester bulking up, and your tot’s a little behind.
Babies need that extra padding to get by in the world. Without a
cushion of fat, they have a hard time keeping warm enough, even
in a 70-degree room. (That’s why hospitals have those toasty incu-
bators.) Even when your baby is big enough to leave the hospital
and come home, he’s often smaller than a full-term infant, and
every ounce counts for staying warm.
Babies in the third trimester and full-term newborns gain as much
as a pound a week. If he’s healthy, your early bird will closely follow
this rate. The younger and lighter he is, the faster he grows — and
the more food he needs. Because he’s catching up, he has the same
intense eating habits as a newborn, but for a much longer time.
In short, when he’s not sleeping, your cherub will be eating — day
and night. So think of yourself as a 24-hour diner for now. Your
reward comes as those little cheeks plump up, those little arms
and legs get fat and dimply, and your sweetie stockpiles enough fat
to snooze happily through the night.
Beating health setbacks
Medical problems for preterm babies tend to fall into two impor-
tant categories — big and small. The major problems involve 
the function of critical organs (like the lungs, brain, and skin) and
often lead to a long and complicated stay in NICU. The minor ones
(such as maintaining temperature, establishing reliable breathing
rhythms, and learning to eat) are less scary but can place big
demands on you in the early days.
Big or small, medical problems affect your baby’s sleep — and
yours as well. Here’s why:
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
188

 Preterm babies are vulnerable to infections that can cause sleep
setbacks. The more premature an infant is, the less developed
her skin and the more likely she’ll need IVs and other lines.
These vulnerabilities — in addition to an immature immune
system — contribute to a much greater risk for serious bacterial
infections of the bloodstream. And lung problems greatly
increase the chance of developing pneumonia.
 Bringing a new baby home is exciting but stressful. That
stress is multiplied if your infant comes home with monitors,
feeding tubes, or medications because each of these interven-
tions has a special way of disrupting sleep.
• Monitors are noisy. They go off frequently, causing loud
noises and the commotion of worried parents rushing to
wake Baby up.
• Feeding tubes are very uncomfortable, and that discom-
fort can easily interrupt sleep.
• Many of the meds for premature babies have side effects
that disrupt sleep.
 The extra work of maintaining a temperature of 98.6 degrees
in a smaller body can interfere with normal sleep cycling.
 Growth, although welcome, forces a premature baby to eat
more, again interrupting sleep.
You can’t do much about sleep disruptions due to medical problems
and hospital stays. But as your little snookums gets bigger and
healthier, those meds and monitors play less and less of a role —
and you’ll both be able to sleep easier. There is a light at the end of
the 24-hour tunnel!
Top Priority: Keeping Your
Premature Baby Safe
In many ways, premature and term infants aren’t all that different.
For example, all parents want their sweeties to grow up healthy,
safe, and strong. Parents of on-time arrivals and early birds make
safety a top concern. The difference is that keeping a premature
baby safe is a tougher job, especially if Baby arrives very early. In
this section we look at some of the big threats to your premature
infant’s safety and what you can do to reduce these risks.
Chapter 12: Sleep Tips for Families with Premature Babies 189

Cutting the risk of SIDS
One huge worry for parents of preterm babies is sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS), but the very encouraging news is that SIDS
is rare, even in babies who arrive early. Nevertheless, 1⁄3 of SIDS
cases do occur in premature infants, so it’s crucial to take every
possible precaution.
In Chapter 4, we outline the rules that can greatly minimize your
baby’s risk of SIDS. Read them, and follow each one to the letter —
they’re especially important when you’re caring for a premature
infant.
Swaddling your baby 
to keep him safe
Thousands of years ago, way before the invention of disposable
diapers, parents came up with another smart idea, swaddling —
that is, wrapping a baby snugly in a blanket, keeping his arms close
by his sides. You can do this with a regular blanket or with a spe-
cially designed swaddling blanket.
Swaddling mainly adds comfort to your baby’s life. But, because
some features of swaddling may reduce the chance of SIDS, we dis-
cuss it in this safety section as well. Here are some of swaddling’s
big benefits:
 It gives your sweetie a sense of security. Swaddling may
make babies feel a little like they’re back in the womb, which
is especially comforting for a preterm tot.
 It promotes quiet sleep, which evolves into mature sleep.
Mature sleep is key to snoozing for longer stretches at night
and staying awake longer during the day. (See the earlier sec-
tion “Growing into a sleep pattern.”)
 It may help reduce the risk of SIDS. Some researchers note
that swaddled babies react more to sound (for unknown rea-
sons), and this increased ability to rouse themselves may
reduce their risk of SIDS. Also, when you swaddle your baby
correctly, it keeps the blanket off his face — another impor-
tant way to reduce the risk of SIDS.
A premature baby is especially vulnerable, so keep a close watch
over him. If you swaddle your baby, follow these precautions:
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
190

 Check with your pediatrician to make sure swaddling is safe
for your little one. Of course, if your baby has an oxygen line
or other tubes that can get in the way, you need to hold off on
swaddling until your baby doesn’t need these interventions
anymore. Your pediatrician can be very helpful in letting you
know the right time to begin swaddling.
 Make sure your swaddled baby doesn’t get overheated. This
condition can happen to swaddled babies who sleep in hot
rooms (over 72 degrees). Suspect overheating if your infant
seems uncomfortable, is flushed, feels hotter than expected,
or is simply very fussy. If your baby has a fever, don’t swaddle
him until his illness passes.
 Swaddle your baby carefully and properly. Figure 12-1
shows the proper ways to swaddle a baby with a regular blan-
ket or a special swaddling blanket. The main caution is to
avoid swaddling so tightly that your baby is uncomfortable,
has trouble breathing, or has trouble with blood flow to his
hands and feet. (To double-check, squeeze his toe. The blood
should flow back into it within a second after you release it. If
not, the blanket’s too tight.)

Dealing with an apnea monitor
Infants who leave the hospital earlier than five weeks before their
due date often come home with an apnea monitor because their
ability to remember to breathe in a reliable rhythm may not be
fully developed. This deficiency can result in apnea of prematurity,
a condition in which a baby breathes too shallowly or stops
breathing altogether (different from childhood or adult apnea,
which typically stems from structural obstructions to the airway.)
The beep of an apnea monitor can mean that Baby’s breathing has
stopped. However, it can also mean that the machine is malfunc-
tioning (for instance, if a lead comes loose). When you respond to
one false alarm after another, you may feel like throwing the
machine out the window!
Apnea monitors can drive you crazy because they’re prone to false
alarms, but medical professionals have good reasons for recom-
mending these monitors in certain situations. For example, your
baby may need a monitor:
 If she comes home before she develops a highly reliable
rhythm of breathing. The ability to breathe regularly all the
time usually develops after five weeks before due date, and it’s
even more likely to be in place by three weeks before due date.
 If she has an abnormal windpipe or has a tube in her airway.
 If she’s already experienced an event in which she stopped
breathing for too long a time, threatening her safety.
 If she had severe breathing troubles in the hospital, requiring
enough ventilatory support that her lungs developed scars
and she now requires extra oxygen at home.
 If she has any additional medical condition that impairs her
ability to breathe — for instance a neurological condition (from
bleeding in the brain) or weakness (from difficulty in growing).
Apnea monitors are designed to let caregivers know when a baby
stops breathing. As it turns out, this is not the same as preventing
SIDS. In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatrics reviewed stud-
ies on monitors and found that home monitors do not reliably pre-
vent SIDS, suggesting that SIDS really is a different problem than
the forgetting to breathe that occurs in very premature infants. So
apnea monitors can be lifesavers for babies who don’t have good
breathing rhythms yet, but they’re not helpful in preventing the 
different problem of SIDS.
If you and your doctor decide that a monitor makes sense, be sure
the doctor prescribes a good model; this choice can reduce the
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
192

number of false alarms you experience — without creating a risk of
missing real ones. Your doctor can probably identify which moni-
tors in your area are best. All good models also have the capability
to record data each time the alarm goes off, so your doctor can
analyze what’s going on.
Adjusting Your Life 
to Accommodate 
a Preterm Baby
When your sweetie arrives early, the biggest challenge by far is 
the risk or reality of serious illness. If you avoid or overcome this
danger, your baby’s homecoming is a joyous occasion. Coming
home is a dramatic sign that your baby, although premature, now
is strong, healthy, and mature enough to thrive without all the 
supports of the hospital — and that’s great news!
At the same time, coming home after a premature delivery puts a
lot of pressure on you. You’re waving goodbye to the hospital and
its team of nurses and doctors — with its endless stream of tests
and interventions — and replacing them all with little ol’ you. Of
course, the medical system stands by ready to help, but from this
point on, you’re in charge. That’s why you need to have a good
handle on what to expect as the next few weeks and months pass.
Watching your baby develop
Ever watch a science-class film of a flower blossoming? When the
frames ran in real time, the flower didn’t seem to budge. But time-
lapse photography showed the bud steadily unfurling and the
petals reaching out and opening up to the sun.
Watching your preterm baby grow and change is similar to watch-
ing that flower. His progress can sometimes seem slow, but in real-
ity he’s changing remarkably — inside and out.
If you feel frustrated when you see full-term babies gaining weight
and hitting milestones earlier, stop and remember that your baby
needs to devote much more effort to his internal functions. As a
result, he often appears to be hovering at each developmental
stage. For example, full-term infants often gain weight rapidly every
day, starting at 3 to 4 days of age. Premature infants, on the other
hand, frequently hover at one weight for a week or so before experi-
encing a burst of rapid growth. In the long run, however, healthy
premature infants catch up to their peers — so patience pays off.
Chapter 12: Sleep Tips for Families with Premature Babies 193

Both term and preterm infants grow; it just takes a premature 
baby a bit longer to do so. This hovering also means that he’ll hit
plateaus in his sleep development — so think in tiny steps if you’re
going to get your sweet-pea to sleep through the night.
Combating sleep difficulties 
in the early days
At the beginning of this chapter we look at how prematurity affects
the life of an early bird and her family. Now we turn our attention
to that big question: What can you do about sleep?
The first step in getting your little huggy-bear to sleep for longer
stretches is simple: Sit back and wait till she’s ready.
At a minimum, count on being up every few hours for the first four
months plus the number of weeks your sweetie arrived early.
During this time, she may need to eat as often as every 1 1⁄2 to 2
hours. Her body has two jobs at this point — growing and eating.
Sleep will follow later, when she can go for longer stretches with-
out topping off her tank.
But while your little angel’s busy growing up and filling out, you
need to play the waiting game. At some point, your patience starts
to pay off — you spot these signs that your darling is ready to
switch from catnaps to real snoozes:
 Her medical issues are under control.
 She consistently puts on weight.
 She goes for longer stretches between feedings.
These visible signs mean that a big change is happening on the
inside: Your little cupcake’s sleep pattern is maturing. She’s spend-
ing less time in immature active sleep and more time in quiet sleep
(for a refresher on these terms, see “Growing into a sleep pattern”
in this chapter). This maturation shifts her toward snoozing more
deeply at night and becoming more alert during the day.
After these changes occur (about four months after her original
due date, not her arrival date), you can follow the steps in Chapter
4 for reducing one feeding at a time to get your baby to sleep
through the night. From that point on, simply follow the same drill
we outline for full-termers. All systems go — full speed ahead!

t’s an all-too-common scenario: You work so hard to build an
ideal sleep routine, and then along comes an illness — one of
the top culprits for throwing a sleep schedule off-kilter. When you
don’t feel good, you don’t sleep well, and that goes double for
babies and toddlers. No one’s more miserable at night than a
stuffy-nosed infant, a tot with diaper rash, or a preschooler with 
an ear infection. (If you ever suffered an ear infection as an adult,
you probably have deep sympathy for the young ones who get
them all the time!) Worse yet, the whole family suffers when a
tyke is sick or hurting because kids firmly believe in sharing 
their misery.
So what do you do when your little cherub wakes up in the 
middle of the night with a fever or your 2-year-old has an itchy
throat? In this chapter, we describe the steps you can take to 
ease your sweetie into slumber when a bug, itch, or ouch is 
barring the door to Sleepyland. We also explain how some 
medications can keep your little one wide-awake (or conk her 
out) so you know which ones to give when, and we help you 
get your child back on track following an illness. Finally, we look 
at the special sleep issues of tots with long-term medical problems
and sleep disturbances.

Coping with Garden-Variety 
Bugs and Ouches
Newborns are lucky when it comes to germs because the antibod-
ies they pick up from Mom before birth protect them against many
common bugs. But older babies and toddlers, just like grownups,
get colds, the flu, and other icky stuff. In fact, kids just starting in
preschool or day care are big targets for illness because a building
chock-full of little tykes with dirty hands and runny noses is sheer
heaven for germs.
However, viruses and bacteria aren’t the only culprits that can
keep your baby or toddler awake. There’s also colic that comes
from acid reflux or allergies (we cover this in Chapter 4) and vac-
cine reactions that can chase sweet dreams away. And then there’s
the irritation of diaper rash — one of the most-common occupa-
tional hazards of babyhood.
Any of these villains can easily derail a night’s rest because a
person normally cycles from deep sleep to near-waking and back.
It doesn’t take much to jar adults or babies from a light sleep; any
little itch or pain can do the trick. (For a refresher on sleep cycles,
check back to Chapter 2.)
Letting go of the schedule 
(temporarily)
The microscopic battle that’s raging inside your sick cherub takes
lots of energy, making her too wiped out to run around or digest
food. That’s why she drags through the day and picks at her
dinner. And her stuffy nose, achy joints, and tummy woes intrude
on her sleep at night, waking her up every few hours. Even when
these symptoms quiet down, the inner war that her cells are
waging can throw off her usual sleep patterns and make it hard 
for her to fall asleep and stay asleep.
When acute illness throws your child’s sleep routine out the
window, you need to suspend the sleepy-time rules and make heal-
ing your top priority. Allow your child to sleep when she wants,
even during the day, and go to her any time she calls for you.
When the illness is over, resume your routine as soon as possible.
Letting your child remain off-schedule much after the illness
passes means you have more work getting her to resume the 
routine later. (For info on timing, see the “Resuming the routine”
section later in this chapter.)

196

Caring for a sick, sleepy 
child: Comfort is key
Most common childhood illnesses are brief, harmless infections
caused by one type of germ in particular: the virus. Of course,
these illnesses don’t seem harmless when your normally bright-
eyed sweetie is sick as a dog, and they don’t seem brief when he’s
runny-nosed and mopey for one to two weeks at a stretch. But
these common bugs are no big deal, and before you know it, the
symptoms are just a memory.
That quick turnaround is important because doctors don’t have
medicines to kill the viruses that cause common colds and stom-
ach flu. Antibiotics, for instance, don’t work because they don’t 
kill viruses.
In the absence of a cure, the best remedy is to offer comfort. But
what is comforting to a dribbly-nosed, coughing, feverish, or
poopy little one? Here’s our suggestion: Whatever works for your
tot, whether it seems comforting to you or not. So if a humidifier
makes you feel great when you have a cold, but it makes your child
miserable, don’t use it for him. If you love being propped up with
lots of pillows when you’re coughing but your child doesn’t, don’t
do it. You get the idea.
Your sweetie will need the most comforting after sundown because
his levels of cortisol (a natural comforter — see the sidebar “The
cortisol connection” later in this chapter) drop after dark. As a
result, all those aches and pains rev up, making him absolutely
miserable, and you’ll notice that he needs extra reassurance in 
the evening and the middle of the night.
Chapter 13: Sneezes, Sniffles, Aches, and Pains 197
A mother’s protection lasts and lasts
Newborns have a whopping advantage over older babies and toddlers during cold-
and-flu season. For the first four to six months, they’re shielded against many
common illnesses by the antibodies passed on by Mom’s body during pregnancy,
and breastfeeding also offers some protection.
If Mom had a particular strain of cold virus last year, for example, Baby is safe from
getting the same bug until around the 6-month mark. Ditto if Mom had chickenpox.
So babies younger than 6 months tend to have no more colds or other viruses than
their mothers, and often they have none at all. Some of this protection lingers for
years, which is why illnesses such as chickenpox are milder in younger children
and more severe for adults.

Using medicines and ointments to ease the discomfort
When your sweetie is droopy, you want to help — right now! To
soothe his woes and help him sleep soundly, you may be tempted
to reach for a cough syrup, fever medicine, or other over-the-
counter remedy.
In reality, however, there’s no magic pill for a cold or flu bug
(remember that prescription antibiotics don’t kill viruses either).
The body’s cells simply need time to win the battle against the
bugs. Even after they do win, the resulting inflammation is much
like a real burn — it takes a few days to heal. And no medication
makes that healing any faster.
Fever reducers
A fever is one of the most common symptoms that make tots miser-
able during an acute infection. And the higher the fever, the more
miserable your tot feels. Note: Fever itself is strangely harmless, but
people often associate high fevers with danger (probably because
everyone just feels far more miserable at 104degrees than at 99).
But the normal range for childhood fever is 100.6 to 105.8 degrees.
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
198
Recognizing when to call for help
If your tot develops an illness, make sure it’s not serious. Call your pediatrician or go
to the emergency room if your baby or toddler:
 Is under 3 months old and has a temperature above 100.6 degrees
 Has trouble breathing
 Looks very ill
 Isn’t eating enough to stay alert
 Seems limp
 Is in pain
 Has a very high fever — or, if she’s under 3 months old, any fever
 Has a fever for more than two days
 Isn’t producing a normal amount of urine
If you have any doubts at all, err on the side of caution and call the doctor. Also, if
an ear infection has your tot howling in pain, ask your pediatrician for advice on
treating it.

Fever isn’t a concern as long as signs of more serious infection
don’t occur. What tells you if a more serious infection is present?
See the nearby sidebar “Recognizing when to call for help” for
important guidance on this question.
Fever is about the only problem that drugs can effectively treat
when a garden-variety virus strikes. And because calming the fever
can effectively reduce your tot’s suffering, it’s one of the best ways
to help your acutely-ill infant or toddler get a little sleep at night.
Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the best drugs to treat fever.
These medicines only comfort your child — they can’t cure him. So
if your love-bug hates these medicines and refuses to take them, let
him decide what’s comforting; don’t force him to comply. (Putting
your foot down is necessary only for drugs that can cure — like
antibiotics for bacterial infections — not for those that merely
relieve symptoms.)
When giving your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen, give the right
dosage. Too much of either med can be very toxic, so be sure to call
your pediatrician for dosage guidance if you have any questions.
One common cause of fever is a reaction to vaccines, which can
often result in a night or two of lost sleep. Today’s vaccines are
more pure than in earlier years, but some children still experience
fever and aches that can interfere with a good night’s rest. Live
vaccines (measles, chickenpox, and flu) can cause symptoms for
days, even a week or two. To comfort a child with a vaccine reac-
tion, follow the drill for colds and other viruses that we outline in
the following sections — the same measures help in either case.
Cold and cough meds
Of course, your grocery store shelves offer a host of over-the-
counter cold and cough remedies that are longtime favorites. In
fact, a recent study found that each month a third of all children in
the United States under 3 years of age receive these medications.
Because parents are so accustomed to using these drugs, they’re 
surprised to hear many experts don’t think the meds pass muster 
on effectiveness or safety. The American College of Chest Physicians,
for example, recommends that you don’t use over-the-counter cough
and cold drugs for kids because they don’t do much good and can
actually do harm, especially in young children.
Drugs can’t cure viruses, so the best medicine is the low-tech 
kind: holding, cuddling, and distracting. Sitting or lying down with
your little one is a powerful comforter. (Maybe your own parents
relieved your suffering during those achy nights with that brand of
Chapter 13: Sneezes, Sniffles, Aches, and Pains 199

medicine!) Distractions can include humming, singing, massaging,
reading, or watching a favorite video. Together, these gentle
moments can help soothe even the achiest child into a stretch of
comforting sleep.
Petroleum jelly and soothing ointments
Infections aren’t the only bad guys who disrupt your tot’s sleep.
Another common culprit for the not-yet-toilet-trained crowd is
diaper rash. A widespread or very raw rash is (if you’ll pardon the
expression) a big pain in the rear — and every wiggle or turn
during the night can make it burn like fire.
The best cure for diaper rash is a simple one: big globs of good,
old-fashioned petroleum jelly. You can use more expensive diaper
rash ointments as well, but they don’t work any better.
If petroleum jelly or ointment doesn’t work, leave your baby’s diaper
off and let him air dry. (Put plastic sheets under his bed sheets.) If
the diaper rash looks at all serious, have your child’s pediatrician
check it out to make sure it’s not turning into an infection.
Holistic methods
In addition to medications and other comfort steps, moms and
dads use a wide range of holistic, alternative, herbal, or traditional
substances to provide relief when colds or flu strike. Many of these
(good old-fashioned chicken soup to clear a stuffy nose or yogurt
to restore good digestive balance after a bout of the flu) can make
a tot feel much better. Others — for example, some traditional folk
remedies that contain high levels of lead — can be very harmful.
Rather than list all the possible holistic or folk treatments (there
are hundreds, if not thousands!), we recommend that anything you
try passes two simple tests:
1. It works.
2. It causes no harm.
In fact, we recommend that you apply these same simple tests to
all treatments (holistic, alternative, herbal, and traditional), to all
medications, and even to your methods of comforting.
In the case of colds or flu, set the bar pretty high for safety’s sake.
These illnesses are minor and pass quickly, so you don’t really
need to treat them at all. (Any benefit from a treatment is only
minor and temporary, so why take even a tiny risk with one?)
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
200

How can you tell whether a holistic treatment (or any treatment, for
that matter) is safe? One good way is via very trustworthy sites on
the Internet. We recommend the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP) Web site at www.aap.org/sections/chim/. The AAP offers 
a Provisional Section on Complementary, Holistic, and Integrative
Medicine and has extensive links to other very trustworthy sites.
Two words of caution:
 Avoid any site that’s trying to sell a product unless you know
the company is unusually honest. These companies usually
offer biased (and sometimes very unreliable) information.
 If you use an alternative treatment, be sure to tell your child’s
doctor about it, especially if your child also takes medica-
tions. Herbal remedies can interact with drugs in potentially
dangerous ways in addition to causing their own side effects.
Non-medicinal comforting methods
What else can you do to ease your cherub’s path to Dreamland?
Here are some good ideas:
 Prop him up. The more upright he is, the better he’ll breathe.
If he’s old enough to have pillows in bed, use two or three to
raise his head. Just make sure he’s comfortable, or he won’t
be able to snooze.
Chapter 13: Sneezes, Sniffles, Aches, and Pains 201
Inflammation: The hero that looks 
like a villain
When germs invade your child’s body, her tissues react by calling up an army of
warrior cells to do battle. The result is inflammation: swelling, fever, pain, tender-
ness, a Rudolf-the-red-nosed-reindeer nose, and that extra mucus that makes her
sound like she has a clothespin on her nose.
Inflammation can sound (and feel!) like a very bad symptom, but it has the very impor-
tant task of killing bad germs. In fact, inflammation is a person’s best line of defense
against viruses. Although doctors can treat many bacterial infections with antibi-
otics, the body needs to rely on its own immune systems for viruses. The fevers,
sweats, chills, sniffles, aches, and pains that your child suffers are no fun, but they’re
a clear sign that her cells are working hard to get her back in the pink of health.
Unfortunately, inflammation has its drawbacks. As we explain earlier, even when it
does its job right, inflammation causes nasty symptoms. And if it goes wrong and
starts attacking the body’s own cells, it can cause a host of auto-immune diseases
like asthma, arthritis, lupus, or Crohn’s disease.

 Keep the drinks coming. Give him lots of liquids, which can
clear congestion and ease a cough. If he has diarrhea, be sure
he gets plenty to drink so he doesn’t get dehydrated. Also, if
your child is old enough to sip a hot beverage, remember the
old standby, chicken soup, does a great job of soothing a stuffy
nose and sore throat. Milk is okay if your child wants it — it
makes saliva thicker but doesn’t create extra mucus.
 Try steam. Although some kids sleep easier with a humidifier
in the room, others don’t. Try it to see whether it helps. The
same goes for humidifier additives like eucalyptus oil: If you
want to know whether they comfort, try them out. (If you do
use a humidifier, give it a good cleansing every day.)
 Try a safe rub. If you use a chest rub, make sure it’s one spe-
cially formulated for babies or toddlers and doesn’t contain
camphor, which can be dangerous. Ask your tot’s opinion —
some kids breathe easier with a rub, and others object strongly.
 Try suction. See whether removing the mucus from your tot’s
nose with a suction bulb helps him breathe better. This step
works for some kids and not for others. However, even if it is
effective, don’t force it on a tot who hates it with a passion —
which many do.
 Let your child sleep with you (or vice-versa). Nothing is 
more comforting to a child than the presence of Mom or 
Dad, so if you’re up for it, consider letting your child snooze
alongside you.
Follow your child’s lead because comfort measures are only as
good as the comfort they provide (and he’s the expert on that
topic). Do whatever works, but steer clear of cough and cold meds
if you can. Remember that hugs and cuddles trump any medical
treatment.
Resuming your routine
If your tot is over 6 months old and was sleeping through the night
before her illness, get her right back on track —the less delay, the
better. Be on the lookout for the end of the illness so you know when
to shift back to your sleep routines. Some of the signs include:
 Fever is gone.
 Other symptoms of illness are gone or so minor that they
don’t bother your tot.
 Energy level is back to normal or near normal.
 Appetite bounces back.
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
202

However, don’t assume that your tot’s on the same page as you. 
In fact, expect a few sleepless nights when she recovers. She’s
enjoyed your company so much that now she misses you — and
hopes you’ll forget that silly old rule about sleeping through the
night! So she’s likely to come padding into your bedroom at 3 a.m.
or call for you in the night.
Don’t be surprised if this happens, and don’t get mad. After all, 
this plan makes perfect sense from a young child’s point of view 
(if something wonderful happened the last time you called out,
you’d be nuts not to try it again!). The key to success is realizing
that your child may want you, but she doesn’t really need you at
night any more. (Yep, it’s that want-versus-need issue again — see
Chapter 3 for more on this.)
If your sweetie slept peacefully before illness struck, it was
because she comforted herself back to sleep — probably thanks 
to hard work on your part! She also knew that you wouldn’t come
hopping every time she peeped. Her illness, however, created a
new expectation: Mommy or Daddy is on call all night, so I don’t
need to get myself back to sleep. To get her back in the groove, you
need to change that expectation. In Chapter 5, we explain just how
to do that so everyone can sleep snugly again.
We strongly recommend standing firm — well, actually, lying firm if
you’re in bed! — when your tot summons you at this stage. Even if
you rationalize that you’re just checking or taking a peek, she knows
that you’ve come to see her and will sense victory. (If you need help
following through on the no-peek plan, see Chapter 5 for advice.
The techniques in that chapter work for older toddlers as well.)
Chapter 13: Sneezes, Sniffles, Aches, and Pains 203
The cortisol connection
When people battle a bug, they almost always hit rock bottom at nighttime. Why?
Blame cortisol, a natural body chemical.
Cortisol is a powerful steroid, a hormone that’s also a powerful anti-inflammatory
(think natural aspirin). Your body makes cortisol all the time, but it cranks out more
in the morning, peaking around 8 a.m. Cortisol levels drop in the evening and at night.
At full strength, cortisol can help fevers, aches, pains, and drippy noses; even runny
poops clear up. This improvement often leads Mom or Dad to say, “Oh, good —
you’re all better now!” But all those symptoms return with a vengeance when the
sun goes down and cortisol levels plummet. The drop explains why, at midnight,
your poor little tyke feels like something the cat dragged in.

When Meds Keep Your Tot Wide
Awake — or Zonked Out
These days, there’s a pill for everything. Even toddlers get their
share of prescriptions — everything from antibiotics for strep
throat to antacids for acid reflux.
These drugs can make kids feel a whole lot better, and most pre-
scribed medications are very important. However, each one has a
downside: side effects. In particular, many children’s meds can ruin
a night’s sleep — or, conversely, drop your tot in his tracks like a
tranquilized ape. This section gives you the lowdown on how pre-
scription and over-the-counter meds can upset your child’s sleep
schedule and how you can counteract the problem.
All drugs have two names — a generic and a brand name. Most
drugs are sold under a variety of brand names, but each one pro-
vides the generic name in the Active Ingredients section on its pack-
age. Note: In the following list, we provide only the generic names.
Be sure you read the Active Ingredient list on the brand you
choose to verify its generic drug name.
Drugs that make kids wired
Some (but not all) of the biggest culprits in making kids wacky are
drugs that contain chemicals similar to your body’s adrenaline (the
chemical your body cranks out when you’re under stress — say, if
you’re being chased by a bear). Adrenaline makes your heart beat
faster, raises your blood pressure, increases your blood sugar, and
gets your muscles ready to run.
What happens when your child takes a medication containing an
adrenaline-like chemical? Pretty much the same thing. So don’t be
surprised when your child turns into a human tornado, sometimes
for hours.
Here are the most common drugs that make kids wired — all but
the last two are adrenaline-derived. Also note the tips on how to
circumvent the problems they can cause:
 Drugs for wheezing and asthma: Albuterol is the biggest
offender, but the longer-acting asthma meds (for example sal-
meterol and pirbuterol) can jazz up your child and block sleep
for hours. Note: These drugs are crucial for kids with asthma,
so don’t stop giving them!
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
204

Inhaled steroids for asthma like inhaled fluticasone and
budenoside don’t appear to interfere with sleep and can
sharply reduce the need for albuterol-like drugs.
Solution: If your child is using a lot of the adrenaline-like
asthma drugs and not inhaled steroids, ask your pediatrician
whether inhaled steroids are an appropriate alternative. For
many children, inhaled steroids cut down on the need for
albuterol-like drugs and can aid sleep. If this switch isn’t pos-
sible, ask about other choices for the albuterol-like medicines.
One form, levalbuterol, seems to have less chance of causing
agitation or interfering with sleep. Some pediatricians use
ipratropium, which also has less chance of bothering sleep.
 Phenylephrine (the ingredient in over-the-counter decon-
gestants): This drug shrinks blood vessels, and less blood
supply to the nose means less mucus. But that adrenaline
rush also means you pay big time for a clear nose.
Solution: Stop using it. Over-the-counter cold remedies have
little proven benefit.
 Stimulant drugs for hyperactivity or attention problems:
This is usually a problem for older kids, but some preschool-
ers are taking methylphenidate or other stimulants that can
quash sleep.
Solution: Never discontinue such medications without first
talking with your pediatrician. Also, remember that sleepless-
ness is sometimes a temporary side effect that lasts only a
week or two. If your tot’s sleep loss is mild or tolerable, wait 
a few days to see whether the problem passes. If it doesn’t, or
if sleep problems are severe, talk to your pediatrician about
adjusting the dosage or selecting an alternative medication.
 Amoxicillin and oral steroids: These meds can put the
kibosh on sleep.
Solution: Check with your doctor if the med is turning your
tot into a whirling dervish, but don’t stop giving one of these
drugs without consulting the doctor first. With luck, your
pediatrician can offer other choices that are less stimulating.
 Immunizations: Shots can make kids hyper for a day or two.
Solution: Fortunately, the effect has a time limit, so just sit
back and wait for the excitement to wear off.
Drugs that make kids snoozy
As you can guess, some drugs can knock your child out. Allergy
and cold medicines head the list here.
Chapter 13: Sneezes, Sniffles, Aches, and Pains 205

 Diphenhydramine: This antihistamine is one of the most
sedating medicines and is actually sold in another form as a
sleeping pill. It can make a tyke drop like a KO’d boxer.
Solution: Newer antihistamines such as loratadine, cetirizine,
and fexofenadine are designed not to make users groggy. If
your tot needs allergy meds, talk to your doctor about these
alternatives.
 Dextromethorphan: This is by far the most common cough
suppressant in over-the-counter cold remedies. In fact, it’s
available under dozens of different names. Whatever its brand
name, this drug also acts like nap-in-a-bottle for many toddlers.
Solution: Like other ingredients in over-the-counter cold and
cough remedies, dextromethorphan has very limited proven
benefits— so solve the drowsiness problem by discontinuing
this med.
 Ibuprofen: This drug, along with acetaminophen, is the most
common medication used to control fevers. You may be sur-
prised to know it also makes some tots sleepy.
Solution: Think about using acetaminophen instead.
 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole: This antibiotic causes
grogginess in rare cases.
Solution: If your child has this sleepy response, tell your pedi-
atrician. The doctor can help you decide whether a different
antibiotic is appropriate.
 Immunizations: Although shots make some kids hyper, they
can knock the stuffing out of others for a day or two.
Solution: Unless your tot is so zonked that you can hardly
rouse him, sleepiness is a normal side effect — and one that’s
worth the side effect. The protection that immunizations pro-
vide is critically important. If you think your child’s reaction is
extreme, however, call your pediatrician.
Sleep and Kids with Long-Term
Health Issues
Colds and flu last just a few days, but other health problems can
last for months or even a lifetime. If your child has one of these
issues, you’re not alone; tens of millions of children in the United
States have long-term problems affecting their health or develop-
ment. The most common are:
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
206

 Problems related to prematurity — for instance, breathing 
difficulties, developmental delays, or problems related to
bleeding in the brain (we cover these in Chapter 12)
 Problems caused by a haywire immune system (the body’s
defenses revving up when they shouldn’t) — for instance, 
the chronic inflammation of asthma, allergies, or eczema 
(a common skin problem in tots)
 Gene abnormalities — for example, sickle cell anemia, hemo-
philia, or metabolic disorders (disruptions to the body’s
chemical reactions)
 Problems affecting the brain — such as hyperactivity, autism,
seizures, or cerebral palsy
In addition to the stress that long-term health problems add to
your daily life and routine, they can make it tough for a tot to get 
a solid night’s sleep. And because they’re chronic, they can make
getting a good night’s rest a big challenge well into adulthood.
The good news is that you can take active steps to help your child
sleep through the night, as we explain in this section. But first,
because these obstacles may affect your youngster for the long
haul, we explain why chronic illness can disturb slumber.
Understanding how long-term 
health issues affect sleep
Chronic medical problems are very different from a passing illness.
By their nature, they’re long-term or permanent, or they can recur
regularly over many years. As a result, maintaining good sleep rou-
tines can be very tricky for everyone in the family. Here’s why:
 Parents of tykes with health issues have lots of worries 
that sap their energy and make them toss and turn at night.
Toddlers pick up on their parents’ worry and tension, so your
sleeplessness can be contagious.
 Tots worry too. Hospital visits, lab tests, and doctor’s
appointments can leave them with questions and fears — 
and those fears can lap over into the nighttime.
 Many medical problems cause pain or discomfort. Whether
it’s the itch of eczema, the wheezing of asthma, or an inability
of a child with cerebral palsy to roll over and get comfy,
health issues can keep your sweetie wide-awake.
 Typical sleep strategies don’t always work for toddlers with
impairments to their thinking, behavior, or language skills.
Chapter 13: Sneezes, Sniffles, Aches, and Pains 207

Clearly, you can’t just wave a magic wand and make these problems
go away. But you can take steps to reduce both the emotional issues
and the physical problems that rob you and your tot of sleep.
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
208
Knowledge is power!
The more you know about your child’s health problem, the better you can cope and
the more secure you’ll be. Your increased confidence, in turn, helps reduce guilt
and helps your child relax during the day and sleep better at night.
The first step in gaining control over your child’s health issues is to turn to his doctor.
Cultivate a strong relationship with a doctor who knows your child well and is com-
mitted to helping him. In addition, you need to trust her to
 Quarterback the team of specialists your child needs
 Arrange for special therapies
 Stay up-to-date on new developments involving your child’s illness
 Give you the information you need in a way that makes sense to you
But don’t stop there. You can find loads of information at your library or on reliable
Internet sites. In particular, we recommend PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pubmed) sponsored by the National Library of
Medicine; it gives you access to the latest medical literature on just about any topic.
Another great site is from the American Academy of Pediatrics (www.aap.org); it
provides links to truly trustworthy sites for a variety of chronic conditions.
Tufts University also hosts a wonderful site (www.cfw.tufts.edu/topic/
5/124.htm); it’s full of great links on managing chronic illnesses in childhood.
You can also seek out support groups because moms and dads with hands-on expe-
rience are truly the best experts around. If there isn’t a specific group for your child’s
problem, try contacting Parent-to-Parent, a wonderful group that has a chapter in
nearly every state. You can get info on chapter locations at www.p2pusa.org.
Be sure that you and your child’s doctor explore every treatment option. Any ther-
apy that helps your child feel or communicate better also helps him sleep more
snugly at night (or helps you figure out why he can’t). Ask your doctor whether any
of these approaches may be right for your child:
 Medications to treat the health problem
 Special services such as orthopedics or neurology consults
 Medical equipment like breathing treatments or braces
 Speech, physical, or occupational therapy
 Aquatic therapy or other exercise programs

Reducing the effects of chronic 
illness on sleep
The word chronic means long-lasting, always present, or habitual. In
other words, a chronic problem doesn’t go away (at least not for a
while). Nonetheless, you can often reduce the effects of your
child’s chronic problem on her sleep.
For example, if your child has asthma, you can toss out carpets
and stuffed animals and wrap her mattress or pillow in plastic 
and a hypoallergenic cover. For tots with painful nerve and muscle
problems, the right mattress and a new arrangement of pillows 
and bedding can make all the difference in the world. Kids who 
are hyperactive can benefit greatly from calming activities in the
evening and soft music or white noise at bedtime; adjusting the
type or timing of their meds can also reduce sleep problems.
To identify sleep problems you can address successfully, ask 
yourself these questions:
 Is my child’s disability related to this sleep problem?
Knowing how a medical issue affects sleep can suggest solu-
tions. For instance, blind children often have trouble estab-
lishing a day/night schedule, so their parents use cues like
music to mark the transition from light to dark. Their doctors
sometimes prescribe melatonin, a sleep-inducing chemical.
 Can medication, surgery, or other approaches solve the
problem? Talk to your child’s doctor about these options.
Most medical centers offer programs to help kids and adults
deal with chronic pain, and sleep clinics can address other
issues like apnea (See “Snoring and Sleep Apnea: Not Just
Grownup Problems!” later in the chapter).
 Can other parents help? Check the Internet or ask parents at
support groups. One good trick is to join Internet discussion
groups where you can query other parents about your tot’s
problems (see the nearby sidebar “Knowledge is power!” for
helpful links to get you started). Odds are you’re not the first
parent with these problems, and somebody else may have a
bright idea for solving them.
 Do any stores offer special equipment to help solve this
problem? It’s amazing how many gadgets you can find for kids
with sleep issues: special beds that can help prevent bed-
sores, blanket cradles for sensitive skin, ropes for toddlers to
pull themselves out of bed, and so on. Ask your insurer what
your plan covers.
Chapter 13: Sneezes, Sniffles, Aches, and Pains 209

 Can my child’s strengths compensate for her problems?
A child with limited leg strength, for instance, can have leg
pain as well — a problem that can make sleep elusive, espe-
cially if turning over in bed is tough. But the same child may
have excellent upper-body strength. A good therapy team 
may be able to design a program that uses those strong arms
to compensate for aching legs. The result: a better and longer
night’s sleep.
Physical therapists and occupational (daily living skills) therapists
often have great advice. Be sure to ask your child’s therapists for
ideas and suggestions.
If your child has a developmental disability like autism or Down
syndrome or she’s hyperactive and can’t settle down at bedtime,
see whether her doctor or school can steer you to a specialist in
behavior modification. These professionals have special tricks up
their sleeves that can sometimes solve stubborn sleep issues, and
they may come to your home to design a tailor-made plan.
Snoring and Sleep Apnea: Not 
Just Grownup Problems!
Most people think of snoring and sleep apnea (when breathing
stops long enough to cause problems) as grownup problems, but
they sometimes affect little people as well. That’s why you need to
know the difference between harmless, run-of-the-mill snoring and
the more serious problem of sleep apnea — you can ignore the
former, but you need to handle the latter.
Snoring
Snoring occurs when the soft tissues at the back of your throat
touch the throat when you breathe. Anything that brings these 
tissues together can cause snoring noises. Common culprits
include: anything that leaves those tissues swollen (like colds 
and allergies); being overweight; or a mouth structure that brings
these tissues very close to each other.
Snoring isn’t the same as sleep apnea (see the following section),
but it can sometimes be a symptom of it. About 10 percent of all
kids snore, but only 10 to 20 percent of these snorers have sleep
apnea. If a snoring child’s oxygen levels don’t drop, he doesn’t
have sleep apnea and you have no need to worry.
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
210

The only way to be sure whether it’s snoring or apnea is to meas-
ure oxygen levels during sleep with a simple device that snugs
onto a person’s finger or toe. Note: Only a sleep lab can do this
reliably.
If your tot’s snoring is fairly quiet and he seems very comfortable
(he’s not thrashing around like he’s hungry for air), then the snor-
ing is probably just that — a mild noise that’s not of much concern.
Sleep apnea
If your tot suffers from sleep apnea, she has abnormally long pauses
in breathing. The biggest concern is that her oxygen supply drops to
unhealthy levels. Here are potential warning signs of sleep apnea:
 Distressed snoring: These are red flags:
• Very loud snoring: Your tot wakes everyone in the house,
and people think a bear has gotten into her bedroom!
• Snoring every night: Mild snoring doesn’t usually occur
this often.
• Snoring in every position: Mild snoring usually goes
away if your tot rolls over one way or the other.
• Thrashing during snoring: A child with sleep apnea may
toss and turn violently and look as if she’s hungry for air.
• Snoring that wakes up your child: Regular snoring
doesn’t usually do this.
 New or reactivated bedwetting: This condition can happen
with or without snoring, but it raises concern when it has no
other explanation. Sleep apnea can actually increase urine
production.
 Sleep shortage: If your sweetie drags around like an over-
partied teenager, acting moody and irritable, it can be a sign
of sleep apnea.
 Attention deficit: A surprising percentage of kids diagnosed
with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder actually have
sleep apnea (at least 5 percent). If your toddler seems hyper-
active and has snoring or sleep deficiencies, consider sleep
apnea as the source.
 Slowed growth: Sleep apnea can actually slow a tot’s growth
and leave her shorter than she would have been. This effect
takes years to notice, so don’t wait to see this effect.
Chapter 13: Sneezes, Sniffles, Aches, and Pains 211

Most sleep apnea stems from the lymph nodes in the back of the
throat getting too big. (Think swollen glands, but inside the neck;
the glands on the sides of the throat are tonsils, and the glands just
above the roof of the mouth are adenoids.) When these nodes get
too big, they obstruct breathing when your tot sleeps — a problem
called obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
If your child has enough symptoms to concern you, ask your pedia-
trician to check for sleep apnea. Doctors can treat this problem
with several methods that may include nasal steroids (nose spray)
and, if needed, surgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids.

 Making the best of divorce and remarriage
K
ids thrive on consistency — the sandwich you cut exactly the
same way each time, the book you read so many times that
its pages are tattered. Parents often discover the hard way that 
disrupting these little routines can result in chaos, so imagine how
upsetting a truly big change is to your tyke! Count on an earth-
shaking event to affect every part of his life, including sleepy-time.
Big changes can chase away a child’s sweet dreams and replace
them with bedtime squabbles and middle-of-the-night awakenings.
But even anticipated events such as a vacation or a birthday can
torpedo some little ones. In this chapter, we look at why life
changes affect tots even more than grownups and offer some
words of wisdom on handling the big and little changes that can
stop sleep in its tracks.
Understanding Your Youngster’s
Stress Over Change
As your child grows up, you’re likely to discover that she handled
change better when she was a baby. When separation anxiety
enters the picture (see Chapter 6), changes get trickier because
they often involve partings. But they really get interesting when
she’s 2 1⁄2 to 3 years old.

From your 2- to 3-year old’s point of view, everything revolves
around her. As a natural outgrowth, she believes that she causes
everything that happens to her or her loved ones. For example, if
the babysitter leaves for a new job or a sibling breaks a leg, your
little one is likely to think it happened because of something she
did, said, thought, or wished.
Experts call this concept magical thinking, and it contains so little
adult logic that parents often underestimate its power. But in real-
ity, this irrational (although perfectly age-appropriate) thinking is
often the underpinning of a tot’s peculiar behavior.
Self-centered thoughts can play a big role in how your child deals
with a difficult issue like divorce or illness. If your tot believes
she’s the cause of an upsetting or confusing event, her feelings 
can be so intense that she can’t calm down at bedtime or sleep
through the night.
Good changes (like vacations) and neutral changes (like time
zones) can also cause routines to jump off track. Anticipation 
and excitement can keep anyone awake, but they’re an especially
potent mix for tots who can’t really talk out their feelings.
The bottom line is that expected and unexpected changes —
whether they’re life-changing (like a divorce) or simply fun (like a
vacation) — can turn your angel’s world topsy-turvy. And for sensi-
tive tots, even a birthday party can be cause for a meltdown.
Common Life-Changes 
Most Children Face
Any life change that breaks routines, adjusts settings, or brings
new people into your toddler’s world can knock the sleep train off
its tracks. To keep your child on track, prepare him by
 Talking the situation over. You can explain something really
big (like Mom and Dad separating) more formally and a less-
earthshaking change less formally. For instance, if you’re plan-
ning a move and you pass a moving van on the street, say
casually, “Soon the van will come to our house, and that’s how
your toys and bed will get to the new house.” Then follow up
later with a detailed discussion.
Children need to hear info again and again. Bring the topic 
up when it’s appropriate by looking and listening for clues 
your child gives you. One obvious clue can be sleep problems,
and one good solution is to bring up the topic up during your
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
214

bedtime ritual. For instance, if you’re divorcing, reassure 
your tot that you understand that he’s confused and sad but
that Mom and Dad love him and will always be there to keep
him safe.
 Creating visual aids. Use homemade books, calendars, and
parallel stories to help give your child a concrete idea about
the changes. These techniques are simple and sure hits with
the toddler set:
• Homemade books: Libraries offer books designed to
help children through difficult situations, but nothing
works better than a book that you create just for your
child. The book can help explain big issues like a divorce
or serious illness or little issues like vacations and
moving to a big bed. Follow these suggestions:
In a photo album, illustrate the change with photo-
graphs or even pictures from magazines or the Internet.
Write important words on index cards and slip them into
place. Note: These words are important because you
want everyone who reads the book with your tot to give
the same message.
The book can be short — a few pages — but make 
sure it includes info about your sweetie’s feelings. For
instance: “Joey will miss Mommy and Daddy when they
are away and they will miss Joey, but they will come
back.” (Turn back to Chapter 10 for more details on
homemade books and an illustration of one.)
Bind the pages with electrical tape so little hands can’t
take the book apart.
• Parallel stories: These social stories are a wonderful way
to talk about events and feelings as if you’re talking about
someone else (like changing the names to protect the
innocent!). Make up a name (keep the sex and the age the
same as your star), or use a real person that your child
knows, or even use yourself. For instance, if you want to
prepare your babe for a move, start with, “When I was 3,
my family moved to a new house. I was afraid my toys
wouldn’t get packed and that I couldn’t find my room!”
Calendars: Children in this stage are getting a sense of
time, so a calendar helps them get a better grip. Use
your calendar as a countdown (“This many days until
your birthday party”) or to clarify his schedule (“This 
is a day Mommy picks you up; this is a Daddy day”).
In the following sections, we look at two of the most common of
exciting life events — a move to a new house and a vacation — and
help you minimize their damage to your tot’s bedtime routine.
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 215

It’s moving day!
If you’re planning a move (especially if it’s to a bigger and better
house), you probably expect your little dumpling to be thrilled
when you tell her, “You’re getting your own room!” or “Our new
place has a great big yard.” But adult logic is often lost on a child.
So the move that has you all excited can have her up at night, wor-
rying or clinging to you tearfully.
To make the move to your new digs easier, follow that all-impor-
tant rule: Tell your sweetie all about it every step of the way. Let
her know when you start house-hunting and give her a tour of the
new place as soon as you know it’s yours.
Before and during the move
Here are some other tips that can make moving day and those first
few nights in a new home more fun and less stressful:
 Break out the camera. Put pictures of your old house in an
album or use them for your homemade book about the move.
After you move, put pictures of the new house opposite pic-
tures of your former place. If you’re moving too far away to
regularly see your old friends and neighbors, put their pic-
tures in the album, too. That way, your tot doesn’t think they
just disappeared.
 Ask your tot to pitch in. Even an 18-month-old can put some
toys into a box. As she’s packing her treasures, reassure her
that all of them — and her pets and siblings! — are going to
the new house. If she needs new bedroom items, let her help
pick out sheets, comforters, and so on.
 Let your sweetie watch on Moving Day. It’s tempting to out-
source your child on this hectic day, but at the very least, let
her see a few boxes or pieces of furniture go into the van. This
transition helps her understand that her possessions don’t
just vanish, only to reappear somewhere else.
 Have the movers pack your child’s stuff last. “Last in, first
out” is a good motto in this situation. If your child’s furniture
and toys are the last items to go in the truck, then they can be
the first in your new home. This plan allows you to get her
room in order before bedtime. She’ll sleep much better if her
crib or bed is all set up and she’s not surrounded by a confu-
sion of boxes and cries of “Where are the pajamas?”
 Stay close. If a move takes several days and involves compli-
cated travel arrangements, keep your child with you. A sepa-
ration at this time only adds to daytime behavior problems
and nighttime upsets later on. Too busy to watch your sweetie

216

while you’re handling last-minute details? See whether
Grandma or the babysitter can come along.
 Postpone the crib-to-bed switch if you haven’t already made
it. Let your sweetie adjust to one big change at a time. If it’s
time for the crib to go, wait until a few weeks after the move.
After the move
No matter how smoothly your move goes, expect a few sleepless
nights when you first arrive. Here are a few of the reasons and their
possible solutions:
 Look and listen from your little one’s point of view. A new
house means new shadows, new noises, and an unfamiliar
floor plan. Kids can wake up and not get back to sleep
because of their still-strange surroundings. Two suggestions:
• Place nightlights and furniture where they cast few 
shadows and can’t put on a scary light show.
• Spend a little time walking your child between her room
and other parts of the house so she gets the feel of her
new digs.
 Expect some plaintive calls at first. Even the best sleepers
can have trouble settling down due to the excitement of the
move and the newness of their rooms. For a week or two (at
the most!), go in to reassure your child. After that, re-establish
your standard nighttime routine.
 Anticipate a midnight visitor. Even if your little one goes will-
ingly at first, she may find her way into your bedroom later
on. If she does, keep your ultimate goal in mind:
• Allowing her to sleep in your bedroom gives her the 
A-OK to a new arrangement.
• Walking her back into her room — every time she comes
out — tells her you want her in her own room.
Be reassuring but firm, and let your gut guide you. If she
really seems scared, you may want to sit nearby until
she nods off. Note: After a few days, wean her from this
expectation or you may be sitting in her room until she
leaves for college! Wean her slowly by moving your chair
closer to the door and then into the hallway. Or go cold
turkey when you feel she’s wanting, not needing you.
 Seize the moment. If your child wasn’t getting to sleep on her
own in the old house, a move may provide the perfect oppor-
tunity for you to establish a new routine. If so, make sure that
you’re in the new house for at least two weeks and have a
semblance of organization before you start a routine to help
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 217

your tyke get herself to sleep (see Chapter 5 on getting a bed-
time routine going).
 Expect the unexpected. The exciting news “You’re getting
your own room!” isn’t so great when it becomes a reality.
Frequently kids find it harder than they expected to give up
each other’s company.
If your children balk at sleeping in separate rooms, start grad-
ually by having them nap in their own rooms while sharing
the same room at night. Usually they just need a little time to
get used to the idea. (If they really don’t like it, put them back
together and presto! You have a new den!)
Traveling with (and without) your tot
You may remember wonderful vacations that left you relaxed,
refreshed, and ready to take on your world. But add parent to your
job title and you add a different kind of vacation experience. With
or without your little bundle of joy, vacations have both their ups
and downs.
If you bring your child along
Vacations with your child create a lifetime of memories. One day you
may look fondly back at the picture of your tot looking adorable in
his sunglasses and floppy hat, shaking hands with Mickey Mouse or
watching Old Faithful blow. Of course, by then, you’ll have forgotten
all the horrible nights you spent crammed into a hotel room, listen-
ing to your spouse snore and your tyke say, “I can’t sleep.” “When
are we going to the lake tomorrow?” “I’m hungry!”
Those restless nights are part-and-parcel of the vacation experi-
ence, so you can’t totally avoid all the sleep chaos. However, here
are a couple of ways to minimize the madness:
 If your budget can handle it, spring for a hotel suite with a
small kitchen and two or more rooms. It’ll give you extra pri-
vacy, and the kitchen can help to keep meals on track (which
in turn can keep sleep schedules smooth).
 Avoid overdoing it. You can always come back to the same
vacation spot another year, so don’t cram in too many activi-
ties each day. Give your tyke plenty of time to unwind and just
hang out; he’ll be less likely to have a bedtime meltdown.
 Factor your child’s age into the equation. Very young infants
are actually the easiest to travel with, and they often sleep as
soundly on the road as they do at home. Toddlers are typi-
cally the worst travelers because they acutely feel changes
and don’t have the language to tell you what’s worrying them.
That means you have to do some extra preparation:
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
218

• Bring your babe’s favorite transitional object with him.
Your little tyke doesn’t have a special lovie? Then be
sure to bring his own sheets or blanket so he feels more
secure. (This is a good idea for all kids.)
• Make a book about the trip (see our advice on making
personalized books earlier in this chapter).
• Let him pack a few special items in a small backpack to
take on the plane if you’re flying.
• If he’s still in a crib, try to get one at your hotel so he
feels more at home.
• Try to keep his naps and bedtime on schedule. This goal
may be impossible some days, but the more consistency
the better. Babies can generally snooze anywhere, and
older children can understand the special occasion, but
those 2-year olds . . . they thrive on consistency.
 Expect two or three off-schedule nights when you return. It’s
normal, and it’ll pass if you keep the bedtime rules consistent.
If you leave your child at home (or elsewhere)
A different situation arises when you go on a trip and your angel
stays behind. It’s a rare child who doesn’t give Mom or Dad some
payback for taking a kid-free vacation, but you can keep problems
to a minimum if you follow these rules:
 Set the stage for your goodbye. Prepare your child ahead of
time by telling him where you’re going, who’s taking care of
him when you’re gone, and when you’ll be back. We strongly
suggest creating a personalized picture book (see tips earlier
in this chapter) that he can look at before and after you leave.
• The book should contain specific information about who
will care for your child and where.
• A calendar showing when you’ll return is especially help-
ful; have your sitter put it on the fridge and mark off the
days until you come back.
 Don’t be afraid to call. Sometimes the sitter says, “Don’t call”
because your tot gets upset after you hang up. True, but your
little angel feels lots better knowing that you’re OK, you’re
thinking about him, and you’re coming back in a few days!
 Make sure you say “Goodbye.” Slipping out while your
sweetie’s snoozing may seem easier, but this plan can leave
him feeling scared and abandoned. Wake him up, even if it’s
just for a quick goodbye kiss.
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 219

 Keep the home fires burning. Whenever possible, have the
sitter come to your home so your cherub is in his own envi-
ronment. However, if your little one needs to move:
Explain to him where he’s going (a personal book is
handy for this — see our advice earlier in this chapter).
Give him a trial night or two before you leave to help him
acclimate if your tyke is staying with someone in town.
Make the sleeping arrangements as close as possible to
the way they are at home.
If your parents (or in-laws) have an old crib, it may not
be up to current safety standards. For instance, it may
have leaded paint or rails that are too close together. If
you’re not sure, it’s safer to rent a new crib.
Parents often ask how long they can leave a young child. A good
guide is one to two nights for every year of a child’s age. So when
your babe turns 1 year old, a weekend away is just about what he
can handle.
Saving daylight time
One minor issue that causes headaches for just about everyone
with kids is daylight savings time. Whether you’re springing for-
ward or falling back, changing the clocks — even by just an hour —
can throw a young child’s schedule completely out of whack. The
problem of waking too early or getting to bed too late usually
resolves itself in a couple of days, but here are some tricks you 
can use to hasten the process:
 Start manipulating your child’s bedtime about two weeks
before the clocks change. For instance, if your child’s 7 a.m.
wake-up call will change to 6 a.m. in the fall, try moving her
bedtime up 15 minutes every three or four days until she goes
down an hour before her usual bedtime.
In the spring, do the opposite.
 If you’re trying to get a toddler to bed at 8 p.m. but it’s not
dark outside, try blackout shades for her room and the other
rooms she uses right before bedtime. Start your bedtime rou-
tine in these darkened rooms so she’ll associate the darkness
with sleepytime.
 Aim for middle-of-the-day naps instead of later ones so they
don’t push back bedtime till the midnight hour.

If a stay-at-home parent 
returns to work
When a parent who’s been home full-time returns to work, it
changes a tot’s life as well. Going back to work almost always
involves a separation, so his bedtime (which is yet another separa-
tion) is especially likely to take a hit. In Chapter 11 we discuss the
relationship between your sitter or child-care facilities and your
tot’s sleep. In this chapter, we focus on preparing your little one for
the change.
For the under-6-months crowd
If you need to return to work shortly after your child’s birth, the
partings will be harder on you than on your baby. These sugges-
tions can make them easier:
 Choose wisely. If you’re confident in your choice of caregivers
(see Chapter 11 for choosing just the right fit for your family),
your baby can sense this and will probably develop sleep pat-
terns just as if you were around him full-time.
 Keep the connection close. Send in a receiving blanket that’s
been close to your body so your baby has your scent nearby.
 Come and visit. If you work near your baby’s child-care
center or home, don’t hesitate to stop in to feed or play with
your baby. Building an attachment is all-important in these
early months, so spend as much time together as you can.
Don’t worry about your little one making a scene when you
leave — those are a few months away.
For the older baby or toddler
If your baby’s 7 to 12 months old, you may deal with stranger anxi-
ety (see Chapter 6); your angel’s probably reacting with heartrend-
ing tears when you leave. But with preparation and time, even the
most sensitive tot can adjust happily to a care situation. Here’s
how to help:
 Help your little one to get comfy with his caregiver. Bring your
toddler to visit your caregiver before you return to work so
you can make this stranger seem not-so-strange.
 Keep schedules consistent. By this time, you child has firm
likes and dislikes and probably has a sleeping routine. Make
sure your caregiver is aware of the details of putting Junior
down for a nap.
A 2-year-old benefits from your telling him exactly what’s going to
happen and where he’s going to be.
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 221

Dealing with Illness and Death
Think back to a time when you had a cold or the flu and you
weren’t quite yourself. Even if you told your child, “Everything’s
fine,” she probably picked up on your sick vibes and fussed more
than usual — just when you needed peace and quiet the most!
If someone close to your child is facing a major illness, expect this
same reaction from your child — only more so. The upheaval that 
a serious illness causes in your household can rock your baby’s
world, and it’s not uncommon for a tot to handle the situation just
fine during the day and then fall apart at that sleepy-time separation.
Keeping your child in the loop
Many parents think (kindly, but incorrectly) that they should pro-
tect their kids by hiding big problems like illness. But even if you’re
an Oscar-winning actor, your baby or toddler has such a strong
connection to you that you can’t conceal your feelings from her.
And those feelings are immediately felt by your children. Note:
Children may not understand their parents’ feelings for years, but
they still feel them immediately.
In fact, hiding bad news from your child makes matters worse, not
better. When you don’t keep your child in the loop, her confusion
and anxiety increase, making it that much harder for her to cope
during the day and sleep well at night. And she’s not going to miss
all of these clues:
 Lots of doctor visits for the ill family member
 Long absences when a loved one is in the hospital
 Changes in your tot’s schedule (for instance, if a different
person picks her up from preschool)
 Special medical equipment around the house
 A change in the ill person’s personality — depression, lack of
energy, and so on
You can’t expect your smart cookie to miss these signs and signals
that something’s up. She won’t. So take steps to help her cope —
for her own good and for yours. And keep in mind that much of
your game plan depends on your child’s age and ability to under-
stand. Read on.

Maintaining normalcy for a 
baby or very young toddler
You can’t really explain a complicated issue like illness to a baby or 
1-year-old. However, you can help your tyke through this difficult time
in two ways: First, realize that he knows something’s wrong and be
patient when he’s extra-fussy or sleeps poorly; second, reassure him
by keeping his routine as calm and normal as possible. Here’s how:
 Keep familiar faces around. Friends and neighbors may offer
to help out by babysitting during a crisis, but stick to your
usual caregivers if you can. Also, if your child is happy in his
day-care program, keep him there to help stabilize his life.
 Spend as much time with your child as you can — even
when you’re the one who’s sick. If you’re hospitalized, ask
your doctor whether this is possible. If you’re home, try to
keep your little one close by, even if you can’t help with his
physical care. Simply singing or reading to him can keep the
bond between you strong.
 Keep your little one at home. Although you may be tempted
to send your tyke off to Grandma’s until a rough patch passes,
your child will feel more secure and keep his habits on target
when he can sleep in his own crib on a regular schedule.
If you can’t care for him yourself, see whether Grandma (or
another caregiver) can come to your house. Children sepa-
rated from their parents for long periods during difficult times
often develop sleep problems, and bedtime can be even more
of a struggle after everyone’s reunited.
Helping an older toddler 
or preschooler cope
An infant or very young toddler may just sense the feelings of the
grownups in her life, but when your little one begins to use and
understand language, a serious illness or death can have a greater
impact on her; this child of 18 months or older knows something
big is changing in her world. When this happens, she depends on
the important adults in her life to guide her through the maze of
confusing and unsettling emotions.
Explaining the situation
Now that your tot is old enough to have some language under her
belt, you can take additional steps to help her adjust to the new
reality of a loved one’s illness. The most important step — and the
hardest one — is telling her what’s happening.
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 223

When she knows the score, she can ask questions, get reassurance,
and, as a result, spend less time worrying and more time sleeping.
Because your child immediately feels what you do, your explana-
tion can’t create an emotional surprise. Instead, the explanation
actually solves a troubling mystery. Now she knows what’s wrong
and can work with you to understand and adapt.
This conversation is very difficult because parents instinctively
want to shield their children from hurtful and scary news (espe-
cially when they can’t promise a happily-ever-after). But your tod-
dler will be even more worried and afraid if she senses the shadow
hanging over your household and doesn’t understand the cause.
Here are some tips on approaching this sensitive topic:
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
224
Stories from the crib: Feelings that 
make you go bump in the night
Two-year-old Ari wasn’t at all sure he loved his new sister, Beth. She fussed and
cried, and Mommy and Daddy said they couldn’t take him to the park because it
was too cold to take the baby out.
Ari wasn’t happy — he wished that Beth had stayed at the hospital and not come
home with Mommy. Then, one morning, Ari came downstairs for breakfast and found
Grandma there. Grandma told him that Beth got sick in the middle of the night and
Mommy and Daddy had to take her to the hospital.
That night, Ari couldn’t fall asleep and Grandma had to sit in his room. Even when
Mommy and Daddy brought a healthy Beth home a few days later, Ari couldn’t go
to asleep. In fact, he seemed terrified to be alone and literally clung to his parents
when they tried to put him down.
Mom and Dad realized that Ari was reacting to his sister’s illness and that he was
worried that his jealous thoughts had harmed her. Dad sat down with Ari and told
him a story: “Ari, when I was just about your age, Aunt Janey had to go to the hos-
pital and, you know, I was really worried. Sometimes Aunt Janey made me mad and
sometimes I wished I was still the only kid. So I worried that I was the reason she
got sick and had to go the hospital.
“But do you know what my Mommy — your Grandma — told me? She said that all
big brothers sometimes get mad at their baby sisters and that no matter how mad
or angry I was, those feelings never, ever made someone sick.”
Ari listened with wide eyes and open ears. That night, he fussed a little but seemed
much less upset. Within a few days, his sleep schedule was back to normal.

 Explain the word sick. Most children past the 18-month mark
have some experience with being sick. When you tell your tot
that someone she loves is sick, help her see the difference
between
• The kind of sick that gets better with pink medicine
• The kind of sick that lasts a long time and can make a
loved one look or act very different
 Let her know she’s okay. Your toddler may worry that she or
other family members may be sick, too. Assure her that this
isn’t the case.
 Tell her that experts are on the job. Explain that the doctors
are helping her loved one get better. If Grandma’s in the hospi-
tal, simply say that sometimes it’s easier to make a person feel
better in the hospital, where there are lots of doctors and
nurses to help.
 Explain obvious changes. For instance, if Daddy undergoes
chemotherapy and loses his hair, you can say, “The medicine
Daddy needs to get better is so strong that it made his hair fall
out. But after he’s done taking the medicine, his hair will grow
back in.” (And then assure your tot that her own medicine
isn’t that strong and that her hair will be okay.) Your sweetie
will notice a lot (a sick person’s new symptoms, the arrival of
new medical equipment, and so on), but she may be too afraid
to ask. Your simple, matter-of-fact comments can ease her
mind about these changes.
 Ward off guilt. Kids this age can believe that their wishes or
angry thoughts cause bad things to happen, and these sneaky
feelings can wreak havoc with sleep. (Check back to
“Understanding Your Youngster’s Stress Over Change” for
more on this magical thinking.) You probably know how hard
it is to fall asleep if you think you’re to blame for a family
crisis — and it’s even harder to handle those big feelings if
you’re tiny. For instance, little Abby may think that her
brother got sick because she got mad at him for taking her
toy. Or maybe she thinks Daddy had to go to the hospital
because she got angry when Dad wouldn’t give her ice cream
for breakfast.
Make sure your child understands that her thoughts, wishes,
or ideas did not and cannot cause illness. Parallel stories
(more on these earlier in this chapter) are particularly helpful
in letting your child know that she’s off the hook, no matter
how big and angry her feelings are.
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 225

Easing the anxiety
No matter how gently you deliver your message, expect your child
to have some trouble dealing with the situation, especially if the
person who’s ill is Mom, Dad, Brother, or Sister. If your tot’s in the
throes of separation anxiety (see Chapter 6 for an explanation of
this phenomenon), any kind of parting is hard. A parent’s illness
sends her anxiety levels sky-high, and the effects of parting each
night at bedtime can be overwhelming.
Although it’s a tough time for a tot, you can help your child over
this obstacle:
 Stick to familiar routines. If your tot’s in school or childcare,
keep her there if you can. School staff members tend to be
understanding about serious illnesses, so talk to them if you
need to extend your child’s day to meet your schedule
demands. (Keeping your tot an extra hour longer at a place
where she’s happy and comfortable is better than making her
learn the ropes at an unfamiliar place when she’s already upset.)
Do your best to follow normal bath-time and bedtime routines;
this gives your child a sense of stability in the midst of chaos.
 Carve out time for day-to-day needs. Sometimes tots get lost
in the shuffle when parents are overwhelmed by making treat-
ment decisions, caring for a sick child or spouse, and handling
financial and job worries all at the same time. Even though
your own life is turned upside-down, try to find time to attend
to your healthy child’s needs — whether it’s a new pair of
shoes, a story time, or a trip to the playground.
 Break the rules sometimes. We usually praise consistency, but
some days comfort needs to take top billing. For instance, if
Mommy just got home from the hospital, your tyke may not
want to say, “Goodnight” and go to her own room. If that hap-
pens, a shared bed (or cot or sleeping bag in your room) can
feel like the Ritz to her.
 Keep your family intact. You may need to travel to another
city for your spouse’s or sick child’s treatments. If possible,
take all your children along. Many big-city hospitals have spe-
cial apartments where an entire family can stay when one child
needs an extended hospital stay. This arrangement can add to
your workload, but it’s less traumatic (and usually results in
fewer long-term sleep issues) than leaving a child behind.
 Use local and extended resources. Many cities now have cen-
ters or organizations (for instance, the Wellness Community
for families of cancer patients) that offer programs to help
kids cope with illness affecting a family member. Also, most
Part IV: Dealing with Special Circumstances 
226

large hospitals have a child life worker who can offer advice
on helping your child to make sense of a confusing time. Here
are two good Web sites as well:
• www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/coping_with_
grief/bereavement_helpchildren.shtml
• www.cbn.com/family/parenting/OConnor_
ChildrenFear.aspx
If a loved one dies, most parents want to talk with their toddlers
about it — but they worry about scaring their tots or causing some
psychological harm. In reality, pretending that nothing happened is
more harmful because this leaves the child feeling confused and
helpless. So, where to begin?
 If a parent or sibling is ill with a serious disease, let your child
know what’s happening and what your little one can expect. If
you know that the loved one has a terminal illness, you can
begin to explain that Daddy is so sick that the doctor’s can’t
make him better. Make it clear that this isn’t the same as when
your little one gets an ear infection.
 Don’t be afraid to use the word die. Your child will hear it from
people around her and should have some idea of its meaning.
 Avoid describing death as “just like going to sleep.” Such
analogies make the compared event terrifying. In this case,
sleep becomes like dying, and such confusion can often cause
severe sleep problems.
 Let your toddler know that when someone dies, the person
doesn’t talk or eat or sing or play. Explain that you can’t see
the person anymore but that you can look at the person’s pic-
ture and remember the fun you had together.
 You can make a memory book with pictures of your tyke shar-
ing good times with the person who died. Children love and
need concrete reminders, and this book may become a
favorite possession.
Children under 5 or 6 years of age see death as reversible. One day
they seem to understand that Grandma died, but the next day they
ask whether she’s coming to their birthday party. Don’t be sur-
prised if a tot who doesn’t grasp this concept jumps out of bed at
the slightest sound in the hopes that her loved one is returning.
Also, expect (and allow) some regressive behavior. For instance, a
child who’s totally potty-trained may start wetting the bed at night.
Be patient because this regression is normal and will pass as she
adjusts to her loss.
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 227

The death of a close family member or friend is a terrible trauma,
and your child will experience disturbed sleep for some time. At
this point, your child’s need for security and support takes prece-
dence over independent sleep routines. So if she needs to co-sleep
with you for a few months or camp out on your floor, let her do it.
It’ll probably be a comfort to you as well.
The Big Split: Divorce 
and Your Little One
Divorce isn’t rare these days, and it doesn’t carry the stigma it
once did. Nevertheless, children still react strongly when it hap-
pens to their family.
Your child’s self-centered thoughts (see “Understanding Your
Youngster’s Stress Over Change” earlier in this chapter) play a part
in this reaction. He may wonder, “Was I so bad that it made Daddy
want to leave?” or “If I wish hard enough, will Mommy and Daddy
get back together again?” With these thoughts swirling through
your little cub’s head, it’s no wonder the sandman often can’t get 
a foot in the door.
Some general tips to start
If you’re going through a divorce, the advice we offer earlier for
talking about illness or other serious issues with your tot can steer
you in the right direction. Below are some helpful ideas for break-
ing the news about a divorce. These simple steps can’t solve all
sleep problems, but they can definitely help.
1. Explain the situation in simple terms and without blaming
your ex.
• Mommy and Daddy are going to live in separate
houses now because we are not going to be married
anymore.
• Mommies and Daddies can stop being husbands and
wives but they never stop being Mommy and Daddy.
2. Reassure your child that although the divorce is a big
change, their love is not changing.
3. Reassure your child that he is not the cause of the
divorce in any way.

Shared custody: Bouncing 
from bed to bed
Telling your child about a separation or divorce is just the first
step — and not the hardest, by far. The real challenge is working
out custody issues. As you’re struggling with these thorny issues,
your little one is trying to figure out where he fits into this jigsaw
puzzle with questions like “Where will I live? Where will I sleep?”
Whether you decide on a 50/50 time split or one parent to have 
full custody while the other gets weekends and vacations, you 
can count on lots of moving back and forth. The result: lots more
chances for sleep upset! Here are a few tips that can minimize 
the bedtime battles when your child’s sleepy-time place changes
frequently.
Create a schedule your child can live with
If your child is under 18 months old, let him sleep at one parent’s
home all of the time, with the other parent spending ample time
with him during waking hours. Children this age have a hard time
switching gears when their caregivers and surroundings change,
and frequent moves can put a big crimp in your efforts to create a
bedtime routine.
Moving an under-5 child every other day will almost certainly
throw a monkey wrench into his sleep patterns. If you can, create 
a schedule that allows your child to stay at least three consecutive
nights at each house.
One week at Mom’s home and one week at Dad’s works for some
families, but a week without seeing a parent is a very long time for
children under 3 years of age. If you do choose the week-at-a-time
plan, make sure your child gets to see and spend time with his other
parent during off weeks. For instance, during Mom’s week, Dad can
pick up Junior from preschool and take him out to dinner one night.
Make a calendar
One of the best ways to help a young child understand and remem-
ber which parent he’ll be with and where he’s going to sleep is a
simple calendar. Put a picture of Mom or Dad or their homes in
each square so she has a visual reminder of that day’s routine (see
Figure 14-1).
Keep a copy of the calendar at each house and look at it with your
child in the morning. Let your child use a sticker to highlight the
day as you review the plans. For instance, you can say, “You see
Daddy’s picture. He’ll pick you up from school and take you to his
house, and you’ll sleep there tonight.”
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 229

Figure 14-1: A calendar helps your child know where he’ll sleep at night.
Make two cozy nests for your sweetie
Kids need a special place of their own in both Mommy’s and
Daddy’s homes. Each house should have a child-friendly room with
lots of toys, kid-sized furniture, and good lighting. (Also, buy or
borrow an extra crib if your tot’s not yet in a big bed.)
Try to use this room solely as your child’s bedroom so your
sweetie doesn’t feel like an afterthought. However, if your child is
with you only every other weekend or a second bedroom just isn’t
in the financial cards, it’s okay for a room to do double duty. Just
make sure that when your sweetie’s comes for a visit, you convert
it into his special place for his special time with you. Also, siblings
can share a room, but be sensitive about their ages and sexes.
Use discretion when considering co-sleeping
Divorce is often a lonely and confusing time for both adults and
children. So snuggling up together in bed can be comforting for
you and your little one, especially in those first days when your
life’s been turned upside down. It’s perfectly natural for both of
you to need this close connection. If your tot’s less than 18 months
of age, co-sleeping for several weeks or months can ease sleep for
both of you in this transitional time.
However, as your child grows older, continuing to share a bed can
make him feel like he’s taking the place of the missing parent. If
your child gets this idea, he may feel it’s his responsibility to take
care of you and make you feel better.
This isn’t your child’s responsibility, and his misguided ideas can
lead to confusion and inner conflict on his part. On the one hand,
he wants to be the missing parent; on the other, he worries about
what it means to take Mommy’s or Daddy’s place.

230

To avoid laying this big burden of imagined responsibility on your
child’s tiny shoulders and still keep him close to you, consider the
sleeping-bag-on-the-floor routine. This way you don’t send any
wrong signals.
Figure out what stays and what travels
Kids settle in better when they have some clothes and toys that
stay at each house and a few small items that they can carry back
and forth (like a favorite Teddy bear). Make sure you have a set of
the basics — pajamas, toothbrush, comb, a couple of changes of
clothes — at each place.
Agree on a consistent bedtime routine
Okay, we know this isn’t easy. After all, the fact that you and your
spouse are divorced is a big clue that you don’t always see eye-to-
eye! But the bottom line is simple: The more you can agree on
nightly routines, the more peace you can expect at both house-
holds. So try to come to a consensus on your child’s bedtimes,
nightly baths, and so on.
If this agreement isn’t a possibility, then tell your child, “These are
the rules at this house. When you sleep at Mommy’s (or Daddy’s),
there are different rules.” Your child soon learns what to expect at
each house. You can use the sleep schedule in Chapter 5 to help
your tyke keep the rules straight at each house.
Relegate adult sleepovers to your off nights
If you’re planning a romantic rendezvous at your house, save it for
a time when your little sweetie is away. It’s confusing and disturb-
ing for your tot to see a stranger sleeping in your bed, and he’s
likely to get up several times during the night just to let you know
he’s concerned.
Remarriage: Adding Another
Member (Or More) 
to the Mix
Divorce or widowhood rocks your world, and it takes time for you
and your child to put the pieces of your lives back together. Then,
if romance and remarriage enter the picture, all of your routines
take another giant hit. This is a much happier time, but it can still
cause friction during the day and tensions at night.
Chapter 14: When Life Changes Keep Your Child Awake 231

The following examples highlight some of the challenges:
 A child accustomed to co-sleeping can find herself out in the
cold if your new partner thinks the master bedroom is off-
limits to tykes.
 Your new better-half may take a dim view of nighttime wake-
ups by a tot who’s used to seeing Mommy and Daddy in bed.
 You and your new partner likely have some different ideas
about your child’s bedtime routine.
 Even a child who takes this big life change well is going to find
your new relationship unsettling enough to disturb her night-
time sleep.
To get your little one back on the sleep track, follow these guidelines:
 Engage your new partner in some straight talk. Surprise par-
ties are fun, but middle-of-the-night surprises aren’t the right
way to start off a new marriage. (Well, at least not surprises
that involve the kids!) To avoid them, discuss your current
setup with your new honey and come to some decisions
about the kids’ bedtime routines. For instance, do you allow
your child to come to your room in the night? Do you have a
firm bedtime or a flexible one? Thinking about these ques-
tions beforehand can make it a smoother ride.
 Plan ahead when you’re blending children. If you both have
kids, you may need some heavy-duty negotiations to create 
a routine that works for everyone. The closer in age the chil-
dren are, the more important it is to have similar expecta-
tions. (If one child is 4 or 5 years older than another, you 
can always say, “Well, he’s older — that’s why his bedtime 
is later.” If they’re three months apart, however, this line 
definitely doesn’t work!)
 Separate bedrooms are ideal, but often blended families
mean blending bedrooms as well. All children, regardless 
of age, need time to get used to a new family arrangement.
Luckily, kids under 3 usually don’t object to sharing a room; 
in fact, they may welcome a roommate. School-aged kids
accustomed to their privacy are much more likely to have
problems sharing with a step-sibling. Soothe prickly feelings
by using screens to divide rooms and setting firm rules about
not messing with a roommate’s stuff.
 Involve your new spouse in the nighttime routine. There’s
nothing like a snuggle and a shared book to begin cementing
an important relationship.

Ten Tips for Getting 
Your Tot to Sleep
In This Chapter
 Playing the right roles
 Taking your calming techniques to the next level
 Creating a sleep-friendly environment
I
n other chapters, we give you the big picture for getting your
sweetie to snooze. Here, we zoom in on some of the little 
details — because often the subtle tricks make the difference
between an on-schedule bedtime and an extra hour of fussing.
In this chapter we cover the established bedtime strategies like
bathing and noise-proofing and offer brand-new tips as well.
Know Who’s the Boss
Confusion about a single question — Who’s in charge? — is at the
heart of all struggles between parents and children at bedtime.
Because expectations are the key to successful parenting, every-
one can do their jobs so much more easily when their roles are
clear. So when bedtime arrives, here’s the scoop:
 You’re in charge of major clock and space decisions. (When
does the bedtime routine begin? When is head-on-the-pillow
time? Where’s the bed? Where do the parents sleep? When is
wake-up time?) All children look to their parents for guidance
and answers on these questions.
 Your tot’s in charge of getting herself to sleep. Many sleep
problems stem from parents trying to relieve children of this
task. But only the person who’s falling asleep can get herself
to sleep. If you try to do it for her, you only create confusion
and struggle.

When both you and your cherub know your roles, harmony can
reign, and everyone can get that precious gift — sleep.
Snack Smart
Warm milk and some light snacks (a few raisins, a few apple slices,
or a whole-wheat graham cracker) can promote sleep. Stay away
from colas and chocolate; you don’t want your babe waking to a caf-
feine rush. For ideas on healthful snacks, see Baby & Toddler Meals
For Dummies by Dawn Simmons, Curt Simmons, and Sallie Warren
(Wiley). Of course, you’ll skip this tip if your child is a young infant!
Cuddle — Try a Sling
If your newborn has lots of trouble calming down in the evening,
remember that many babies and toddlers love to cuddle and be
rocked. (You’ll know early on whether your infant likes lots of
touch. If not, skip this tip.) If he’s a cuddle-bug, be sure to snuggle
with him at bedtime because it’ll help him make the leap into
sleep. Using a sling is an easy way to get closeness and movement,
and it still gives you a free hand!
Make Bath-Time a Joy
Tubby time is a muscle-relaxing, stress-relieving way to wind down
after a long day. To be sure you’re solving sleepy-time problems
rather than creating them, try these tips:
 Assemble everything you need before you start so you’re not
rushing around at the wrong time.
 If you like to add oils, consider plain baby oil. Use fragrances
only if they don’t cause irritation. Be sure to avoid bubble
baths, the number one cause of bath-related skin inflammation.
Bathing with your tot can be calming and a great way to bond. 
But a wet child is a slippery child! If possible, have your partner
bring Baby to you in the tub, and then pop her into her infant seat
(covered with a towel next to the tub) when she’s done. And think
twice about breastfeeding. Your angel may love it, but it often stim-
ulates a poop — wrong time, really bad place!
After the bath, wrap your sweetie in a big, fluffy towel and rub 
her down gently. Finish off with a soothing massage and bedtime
stories . . . ZZZZZ (see Chapter 17 for good story ideas).
Part V: The Part of Tens 
236

Go for a Stroll
Sometimes a little journey can be a wonderful addition to the bed-
time routine. A stroll, a bike ride (for older infants and toddlers),
or even a short ride in the car can be very relaxing and lots of fun.
Strolls in particular are a great way for families to spend time
together (toddlers can wear their p.j.s). Remember to keep the
stroll calm; this is a chance to wind the day down, not wind the
kids up.
Use Warm, Comfy Sheets
On a cold night, make your child’s bed more welcoming by putting
a warm towel over the sheet just before tuck-in time. If your tot’s
old enough to have a blanket, toss it in the dryer for a few minutes
to take off the chill. And here’s another idea: Wrap Teddy in a pil-
lowcase and give him a quick dryer tumble as well.
Read a Story (or Make 
Up Your Own!)
Telling or hearing a story is one of the most simple and powerful
joys of life. Finding a great bedtime book (see Chapter 17 for ideas)
allows you and your tot to share that joy with each other, and that
can have powerful benefits. For example, reading to even very
young children (or narrating your own stories) clearly promotes
language and reading development, and it seems to improve sleep,
even after your baby or toddler nods off. Tender moments
together, great stories to share from your lifetime, improved inter-
est in books, better language skills, and a better night’s sleep —
that’s well worth the read! See Chapter 17 for ideas.
Dial Down the Noise; 
Dial Up the Calm
As we mention in Chapter 5, soft, predictable noise can mask
annoying sounds and lull your child to sleep. You can buy special
white-noise tapes at baby stores, but any noise — from a ticking
clock or metronome to a DVD of soft music — can do the trick.
Chapter 15: Ten Tips for Getting Your Tot to Sleep 237

Then again, your little one may have trouble falling asleep when
you stop using a heater or air conditioner. Try playing a tape of
quiet rain or other soft nature sounds, or turn on a fan in her room.
Note: Many a newborn is soothed by the gentle slosh of the wash-
ing machine or the chug-chug of the dishwasher. Plunking your
little angel in a safe spot next to (not on top of) one of these noisy
appliances may soothe her more than the sweetest lullaby.
Squelch the Squabbles
If you’re itching to scold your partner about a credit card bill or a
missed anniversary, put your disagreements on ice till your cherub
is sound asleep. Even then, put some distance between you and
the nursery before you start arguing, and keep your voices low and
civil. Tots have amazing radar; if they overhear tense words, they
lie awake worrying.
Check the Thermostat
Unless your baby is premature, he’s snug and happy at the same
temperature as you. But houses can warm up or cool down during
the night, so a room that’s cozy at 7 p.m. can be too cold or too 
hot six hours later. If you find yourself reaching for a robe or kick-
ing off the covers just as your tot wakes you up, consider a trip to
the thermostat instead of your little angel’s room. And if you do
pop in to see him, make sure his room feels comfortable to you.

Chapter 16
Ten Pitfalls to Avoid 
at Sleepytime
In This Chapter
 Sabotaging your routines with timing mistakes
 Straying off course
I
n the previous chapter, we talk about the right moves to make if
you want your tot to sleep. Now, we’re switching gears to tell
you what not to do. Here’s a look at ten big bedtime no-no’s.
Forgetting to Let Your 
Tot Wind Down
Picture yourself coming home at night after a fantastic party or an
exciting movie. Do you immediately throw on your jammies and
turn out the lights? Probably not. Most likely, you kick off your
shoes, prop up your feet, and savor a little quiet time with a book
or a late-night show.
Your tot feels the same way. He doesn’t have an on/off switch, so
he needs time to slide gently from the excitement of his day into
the total quiet of the night. Send him to bed all wound up, and your
whole household may be in an uproar for hours.
As a general rule, 20 to 25 minutes is the outside limit for the pre-
bed routine, but the wind-down can start as much as an hour
before. Here are some ideas:
 Turn off exciting or noisy television shows or videos.
 Turn on soft music.
 Turn down the lights — get your house ready for bed.

 Prepare your child for the trip to dreamland with soft, encour-
aging words such as, “When this CD is finished, it will be time
for your bath and jammies.”
Encouraging Your Tot to Rev Up
Some parents make a bigger mistake than skipping the wind-down
stage; they actually re-energize their little rug rats by watching
loud or violent shows, inviting noisy company over, or cranking 
up the video games as bedtime approaches.
Obviously, you can’t run your house like a monastery, especially 
if you have lots of friends who drop by in the evening. But try to
keep noisier activities out of earshot or mask them with lullabies
or white noise (see Chapter 15).
Stretching Out Bedtime
Foot-dragging at bedtime is a favorite kid ploy, and a tot who moves
at the speed of light in the day hours can suddenly turn slow as
molasses as the clock ticks toward tuck-in time. If your sweetie tries
to slow your beddy-bye ritual to a snail’s pace each night, don’t let
him get away with it. One good trick is to schedule the least favorite
parts of his bedtime ritual right before the best parts. This way he
hurries through the icky stuff like teeth-brushing to get to story
time or a massage.
Being Inconsistent
Fred toughs it out on Tuesday night, resisting the urge to go to his
daughter when she wakes up and fusses. On Wednesday, he turns
into a marshmallow and pays her a quick visit. He gets his courage
back on Thursday and stays in his own bed, but his angel tortures
him by hollering twice as hard and twice as long as usual.
What’s setting her off? Fred is because he keeps changing his mind!
She doesn’t know what to expect from him, so she tests him. When
he fails the test by going to her, he’s really telling her to try even
harder.
Consistency is key here. If you know your little kitten is hale and
hearty, dry as a desert, and has a full tummy, you can feel comfort-
able sticking to your guns and letting her find her way back to
sleep. Every time you poke your head in her room or go in for one
more cuddle, you’re telling her that you’re still at her beck and call.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
240

That said, trust your own instincts when you think you should
break your own rules and go in to check. If you suspect that your
little one may be coming down with a bug or if she had a particu-
larly upsetting or exciting day, then don’t hesitate to follow your
gut and make sure that your precious gem is okay.
Answering Too Many Callbacks
Tell your sweetie, “You can get a drink, read, or go to the bathroom
any time you want — before you go to bed.” After that point, keep
your responses to his plaintive whines — “I need a drink,” “I’m
scared of the dark,” and so on — to an absolute minimum.
Obviously, you need to respond to real emergencies, large or small,
after lights-out time. But ignore the obvious ploys for attention.
And if your sweetie’s old enough, let him know that he can get a
drink of water or go potty all on his own.
Losing Your Cool
In the last chapter, we talked about avoiding quarrels with other
family members when your angel’s trying to doze. That same rule
applies to all tense words as well.
If your computer crashes, the cable goes out, or the dog throws 
up on the carpet, resist the urge to raise your voice. If you let your
temper get the best of you, you’ll have two problems. One is that
your tot won’t sleep well. The other problem is that she’s going to
remember the bad words she hears and repeat them to Grandma.
If your tot’s the cause of your trying day, make sure you reassure
her that you love her and you’re not mad at her (even if she did 
try to flush her toothbrush down the toilet). A child who thinks
Mommy or Daddy is angry at her isn’t able to calm down and go 
to sleep easily.
Missing the Obvious
Too often parents forget that holidays, a vacation, a visit from
Grandpa, or an illness can disrupt a tyke’s sleep schedule. If your
cherub’s routine suddenly falls apart, ask yourself: “Did something
big change in his life?” If so, take steps to put the schedule back on
track. (See Chapter 14 for good ideas.) Change is one of the biggest
and most overlooked culprits in broken bedtime routines.
Chapter 16: Ten Pitfalls to Avoid at Sleepytime 241

Turning the Couch into a Bed
To your child, the couch is an ideal place for some shut-eye because
Mommy or Daddy is right at hand. But it’s not ideal because she
can’t become independent when she doesn’t sleep in her own room.
If you’re watching television together and you see your little sprout
start to get droopy, move up your bedtime schedule and hustle her
off to the sack before she keels over.
Missing Milestones
Bedtime routines aren’t cast in stone, and they need to change
along with your tot. For instance, you need to bump back bedtime
as your sweetie gets older and needs less sleep. Also, you want to
give your tot more and more control over his routine. If not, you
may wind up still tucking your 11-year-old in bed!
Avoiding That First All-Nighter
Loving parents do almost anything to avoid upsetting their little
ones. If your child is used to you in the middle of the night, you know
exactly what to expect when that doesn’t happen: a reaction strong
enough to unnerve even the most laid-back parent. Fearing this melt-
down, many moms and dads never let their tots learn to sleep on
their own. Instead, they just wait it out — sometimes for years.
But, as the cliché goes, you never know until you try — and if you
don’t let your tot try to sleep through the night, you’ll never know
whether she can. (And after four months of age, she can. Trust us.)

Chapter 17
More than Ten Great Bedtime
Stories and Songs
In This Chapter
 The classics
 The lullabies
T
ots can’t go from 60 to 0 in a minute, so you need to provide
time for your sweetie to wind down before he hits the pillow.
You want to avoid activities that excite your child — especially
tickling, running, and the old throw-your-baby-in-the-air game.
In this chapter, we offer a great alternative: a list of tried-and-true
songs and books that signal lights out to your tot. If you bring out
these favorites night after night, your biggest problem will be keep-
ing your own eyes open long enough to offer a goodnight kiss.
The #1 Bedtime Story:
Goodnight Moon
A million babies and toddlers can’t be wrong, and at least that
many kids count Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown
(HarperCollins) among their favorite bedtime stories of all time. It
first appeared in the 1940s, and it’s been going strong ever since —
and for good reason. This sweet tale follows a little rabbit as he
says “Goodnight” to everything in his bedroom. It beautifully sets 
a sleepy pace that will have everyone yawning in your house.
Sheer Poetry
Warm and fuzzy and absolutely delightful are the poems found 
in When We Were Very Young by A. A. Milne and Jon J. Muth
(Hyperion). Older children love the engaging verses of Shel

Silverstein, whose books include A Light in the Attic, Where the
Sidewalk Ends, and The Giving Tree (HarperCollins). Jack Prelutsky
is a big hit with the young set too. Who can resist titles like It’s
Raining Pigs and Noodles, and The Frogs Wore Red Suspenders
(HarperTrophy)? But don’t overlook the real classics, Mother
Goose stories — just pick the ones with the not-so-scary words!
Rhymin’ the Night Away
Everybody loves a rhyme, and your tot will delight to the rhythmic
sounds of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? by Bill
Martin, Jr. and Eric Carle (Henry Holt). Kids love to help you read
the predictable lines, and the repeating patterns can magically
soothe a fussy baby to sleep. Three other rhyming favorites are
The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Carle, Peter’s Chair by Keats (Puffin
Books) and Dr. Seuss’s Sleep Book (Random House).
Talkin’ About Tuck-In Time
Books that center on bedtime are always winners because they get
your tot’s mind focused right where you want it — on sleep. In
addition to Goodnight Moon, other good books include
 A Child’s Good Night Book by Margaret Wise Brown, Jean
Charlat, and David Diaz (HarperFestival)
 Time for Bed by Mem Fox and Jane Dyer (Harcourt Brace)
 If You Were My Bunny by Kate McMullan and David McPhail
(Scholastic Inc.)
 Can’t You Sleep, Little Bear by Maring Waddell (Candlewick)
 Love You Forever by Robert Munsch (Red Fox Books)
Rockin’ Songs for the 
Rocking Chair
Wonderful albums of lullabies abound, from classical collections
featuring Bach and Brahms to Rockabye Baby! Lullaby Renditions
of Led Zeppelin (we kid you not). One of our personal favorites is I
Will Hold Your Tiny Hand by Steve Rashid, which will have your tot
bee-bopping happily off to bed with catchy but calming numbers
like “My Baby Loves to Rock” and “The Porkpie Lullaby.” Evie
Tornquist’s album Gentle Moments includes some lovely songs 
just made to help your tot tumble into dreamland.

244

Best Hit Single
We give our award for Best Bedtime Song Ever to “Hush Little
Baby,” a song that’s been around since the dawn of time. This little
ditty has many variants, depending on what part of the country
you hail from, but here’s a favorite version.
Hush, little baby, don’t say a word,
Papa’s gonna buy you a mockingbird
If that mockingbird don’t sing
Papa’s gonna buy you a diamond ring
If that diamond ring turns brass,
Papa’s gonna buy you a looking glass
If that looking glass gets broke
Papa’s gonna buy you a billy goat
If that billy goat won’t pull,
Papa’s gonna buy you a cart and bull
If that cart and bull turn over,
Papa’s gonna buy you a dog named Rover
If that dog named Rover won’t bark,
Papa’s gonna buy you a horse and cart
If that horse and cart fall down,
You’ll still be the sweetest little baby in town.
It’s Showtime!
Somehow, the same show tunes that set audience’s toes to tapping
can help a baby drift off to dreamland, so try some of your favorites
on your tyke. (But we recommend skipping Stomp! or Phantom of
the Opera.) Classical music is great, too — but forgo the “1812
Overture” and go with something like Pachelbel’s restful “Canon 
in D” instead.
Reachin’ for the Stars
We bet you still remember the first verse of “Twinkle, Twinkle 
Little Star,” but here are the rest of the lyrics in case you’re an
overachiever. This one’s a big favorite with babies, and if you
forget the words in midstream you can always switch to the “ABC
song” because these golden oldies share the same melody.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are!
Chapter 17: More than Ten Great Bedtime Stories and Songs 245

When the blazing sun is gone, when he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light, twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are!
Then the traveler in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark;
He could not see which way to go, if you did not twinkle so.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are!
Bilingual Beddy-Bye
Impress your tot with your worldly ways by offering up both the
French and English versions of the classic song, “Frere Jacques:”
Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques,
Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous?
Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines
Ding ding dong, ding ding dong.
Are you sleeping, are you sleeping?
Brother John, Brother John?
Morning bells are ringing, morning bells are ringing
Ding ding dong, ding ding dong.
If you can’t pronounce the French lyrics, just fake them. It’s not like
your baby will know!

Appendix
Sleep Logs
S
ometimes tracking your baby’s trends can help you get a good
handle on a sleep problem. Other times, more information
simply gets in the way. So break out the sleep logs in this appendix
if you think they’ll help you spot trends and create strategies, 
but don’t feel like you need to use them if you’re not into lists 
and forms.
The first log helps you get an in-depth look at your tot’s sleep pat-
terns right now so you can spot good changes and problem areas.
The second log covers an extended period of time so you can
detect long-term patterns.
The Week-Long 24-Hour 
Sleep Watch
The first log (see Figure A-1) simply charts when your child is
awake and when she’s asleep, all day every day, for a week at a
time (see Chapter 5 for an example). It’s most helpful when you’re
fine-tuning the sleep routine and want to be able to spot patterns.
To use this chart, simply color in sleepy hours with a pen or pencil
(or crayon, if one’s handy!). Then at the end of the week, look at
the overall pattern for clues. For instance: Are naps getting more
or less consistent? Are nighttime calls getting farther apart or
closer together?
If necessary, track your child’s routine for several weeks so you
can get a long-term view of her sleep habits. Given this informa-
tion, you can work on problem areas (like naps that are all over 
the map instead of relatively on-target or bedtimes that get later
each night). This chart can also help you anticipate developmental
leaps that coincide with sleep disruptions.

Figure A-1: The 24-hour, 7-day blank sleep log for babies.
The Developmental 
Sleep Assessment
The second sleep log lets you detect patterns over weeks or
months so you can connect sleep situations to big or little mile-
stones or changes in routines. For an example, refer to Chapter 6.
Don’t fill out this log daily (who has time for that?); instead, make
quick notes on it whenever you notice a change in sleep routines.
The log can then provide a bird’s-eye view of long-term trends 
so you can see what’s disrupting your baby’s once-firm sleep 
routines.
Table A-1 is a blank table for you to copy and use.
