Samba download, install and configuration 
 
• 
Samba is a Linux tool or utility that allows sharing for Linux resources such as files 
and printers to with other operating systems 
• 
It works exactly like NFS but the difference is NFS shares within Linux or Unix like 
system whereas Samba shares with other OS (e.g. Windows, MAC etc.) 
 
For example, computer “A” shares its filesystem with computer “B” using Samba 
then computer “B” will see that shared filesystem as if it is mounted as the local 
filesystem 
 
• 
Samba shares its filesystem through a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block)  
which was invented by IBM  
• 
Another protocol used to share Samba is through CIFS (Common Internet File 
System) invented by Microsoft and also NMB (NetBios Name server) 
 
• 
CIFS became the extension of SMB and now Microsoft has introduced newer version 
of SMB v2 and v3 that are mostly used in the industry 
 
• 
Most people, when they use either SMB or CIFS, are talking about the same exact 
thing.  The two are interchangeable not only in discussion, but also in application – 
i.e., a client speaking CIFS can talk to a server speaking SMB and vice versa.  Why?  
Because CIFS is a form of SMB 
 
 
 
Step by steps installation instructions 
First please make sure to take a snapshot of your VM 
 
• 
Install samba packages 
 
# Become root user 
# yum install samba samba-client samba-common 
 
• 
Enable samba to be allowed through firewall (Only if you have firewall running) 
 
# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=samba 
 
# firewall-cmd –reload 
 
• 
To stop and disable firewall or iptables 
 
# systemctl stop firewalld 
 
# systemctl stop iptables 
 
# systemctl disable firewalld 
 
# systemctl disable iptables 
 

• 
Create Samba share directory and assign permissions 
 
# mkdir -p /samba/morepretzels 
 
# chmod a+rwx /samba/morepretzels 
 
# chown -R nobody:nobody /samba 
 
• 
Also, you need to change the SELinux security context for the samba shared 
directory as follows: (Only if you have SELinux enabled) 
 
# chcon -t samba_share_t /samba/morepretzels 
 
• 
If you want to disable SELinux, follow these instructions 
# sestatus To check the SELinux status) 
# vi /etc/selinux/config 
Change 
SELINUX=enforcing 
To 
SELINUX=disabled 
# reboot 
 
• 
Modify /etc/samba/smb.conf file to add new shared filesystem (Make sure to 
create a copy of smb.conf file) 
Delete everything from smb.conf file and add the following parameters 
 
[global] 
        
workgroup = WORKGROUP 
netbios name = centos 
security = user 
map to guest = bad user 
dns proxy = no 
 
[Anonymous] 
path = /samba/morepretzels 
browsable = yes 
writable = yes 
guest ok = yes 
guest only = yes 
read only = no 
 
• 
Verify the setting 
# testparm 
 
• 
Once the packages are installed, enable and start Samba services 
 
# systemctl enable smb 
 
# systemctl enable nmb 
 
# systemctl start smb 
 
# systemctl start nmb 

• Mount on Windows client 
o Go to start 
o Go to search bar 
o Type \\192.168.1.95  
(This is my server IP, you can check your Linux  
CentOS IP by running the command ifconfig) 
 
• Mount on Linux client 
Become root 
# yum -y install cifs-utils samba-client 
Create a mount point directory 
# mkdir /mnt/sambashare 
Mount the samba share 
# mount -t cifs //192.168.1.95/Anonymous /mnt/sambashare/ 
# Entry without password 
 
 
Secure Samba Server 
 
• Create a group smbgrp & user larry to access the samba server with proper 
authentication 
 
# useradd larry 
# groupadd smbgrp 
# usermod -a -G smbgrp larry 
# smbpasswd -a larry 
New SMB password:  YOUR SAMBA PASS 
Retype new SMB password:   REPEAT YOUR SAMBA PASS 
Added user larry 
 
 
• Create a new share, set the permission on the share: 
 
# mkdir /samba/securepretzels 
# chown -R larry:smbgrp /samba/securepretzels 
# chmod -R 0770 /samba/securepretzels 
# chcon -t samba_share_t /samba/securepretzels 
 
 
• Edit the configuration file /etc/samba/smb.conf (Create a backup copy first) 
 
# vi /etc/samba/smb.conf 
Add the following lines 
 
[Secure] 
 
 
path = /samba/securepretzels 
 
 
valid users = @smbgrp 
 
 
guest ok = no 

 
 
writable = yes 
 
 
browsable = yes 
 
• 
Restart the services 
 
# systemctl restart smb 
 
# systemctl restart nmb
