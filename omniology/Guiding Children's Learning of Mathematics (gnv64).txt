hen contemplating the 11th edi-
tion of Guiding Children’s Learn-
ing of Mathe matics, the au-
thors started by thinking about 
what has been happening in 
mathematics education in the last 
ﬁ ve years. The No Child Left Behind 
Act of 2002 (NCLB) has focused public attention on 
student performance and highlighted the demand 
for more and better mathematics instruction. The 
act requires that teachers be “highly qualiﬁ ed” and 
places an increased emphasis on their demonstrat-
ing their knowledge and skill in teaching. Certiﬁ ca-
tion requirements have been inﬂ uenced by NCLB, 
with more states dividing early-childhood from ele-
mentary licensure and creating middle-grade cer-
tiﬁ cates. Many teacher certiﬁ cation programs have 
also increased their requirements for mathematics 
background. The range of technology resources for 
teaching mathematics has likewise increased—es-
pecially those related to the Internet. Finally, pro-
viding appropriate instruction for all students has 
become more challenging, as teachers work with 
students from diverse cultural, economic, and 
language backgrounds and with varying degrees 
of ability. Each of these factors inﬂ uences the life 
space of teachers and, for that reason, the way in 
which we have organized this edition and what we 
have revised and changed.
While 
acknowledging 
and 
incorporating 
changes in mathematics teaching are important in 
the 11th edition, however, the goal of Guiding Chil-
dren’s Learning of Mathematics is the same as that 
of the ﬁ rst edition, which was published in 1970—to 
provide a readable and user-friendly textbook that 
enables preservice and experienced teachers to de-
velop their own understanding of mathematics and 
to offer them a wide array of experiential activities 
as examples of active learning and creative teach-
ing. Through the years the book has changed as 
chapters have been revised to reﬂ ect current issues 
and emphases; but the philosophy of the book has 
remained constant:
•  Mathematics enriches lives and expands worlds.
•  Mathematics is challenging, fun, and rewarding.
•  Mathematics is a mission and a treasure shared 
by teachers and learners.
We believe that teachers are the critical element in 
creating exciting and successful mathematical ad-
ventures for learners, through
•  Active engagement of students in worthwhile 
mathematical tasks
•  Problem solving and thinking as central goals in 
mathematics
•  Relating mathematical concepts and skills to life 
experiences
•  Communicating mathematical ideas in many 
forms
Over the years, all of the chapters have been ex-
tensively rewritten, incorporating the feedback of 
reviewers, editors, coauthors, and hundreds of in-
service and preservice teachers who have used the

text. In addition, the authors have drawn from their 
own experiences in order to continually improve 
the book. Teaching with a textbook that you your-
self have written is an ongoing and humbling learn-
ing experience. As a student once asked, “Do you 
really agree with the textbook about . . . ?”
Organization
In the reorganization and revision for the 11th edi-
tion, we endeavor to clarify and illustrate mathemat-
ical and pedagogical issues without oversimplifying 
them. An obvious change is the restructuring of the 
text content into smaller and more focused chapters. 
In Part 1 of the book, the NCTM principles and stan-
dards provide the foundation for discussion of what 
is important and how it can be taught effectively. 
Each of the six principles is treated in a separate 
chapter.
•  Part 1: Guiding Elementary Mathematics with 
Standards
 •  Chapter 1: Elementary Mathematics for the 21st 
Century
 •  Chapter 2: Deﬁ ning a Comprehensive Mathemat-
ics Curriculum
 •  Chapter 3: Mathematics for Every Child (NEW)
 •  Chapter 4: Learning Mathematics
 •  Chapter 5: Organizing Effective Instruction
 •  Chapter 6: The Role of Technology in the Math-
ematics Classroom (NEW)
 •  Chapter 7: Integrating Assessment
The complexities of teaching and assessment 
are presented as choices and decisions that teach-
ers make. Rather than suggesting that one way is 
the right way for teaching everything, we suggest 
that many approaches may be successful if they 
adhere to basic principles of effective teaching, 
learning, and assessment. The NCTM principles are 
introduced and the content and process standards 
are described in Chapters 1 and 2 with classroom 
vignettes. The new curriculum focal points (2006) 
from NCTM are introduced in Chapter 2. These help 
teachers identify and focus on critical elements of 
the content at each grade level. Chapter 3 considers 
the equity issues of teaching mathematics to a di-
verse student population: students with gifts and tal-
ents, students who are culturally and linguistically 
diverse, and students with special needs. In Chapter 
4, the topic of teaching and learning is explored by 
way of learning theory, research, and professional 
guidelines for establishing an effective classroom. 
Chapter 5 outlines the many decisions that teachers 
make every day with regard to planning and organiz-
ing the elements of instruction, including materials, 
grouping, time, and space. Chapter 6 presents new 
and emerging technologies that impact mathemat-
ics teaching and learning today. Chapter 7 describes 
the rationale for classroom assessment, using a va-
riety of techniques that teachers employ to enhance 
and adjust instruction.
Having a separate chapter for each principle pro-
vides modules that may be used in a variety of ways 
by instructors and students. For example, the prin-
ciples could be used to introduce the course, or they 
could be used at different times in connection with 
the chapters in Part 2.
In Part 2, important mathematical concepts are 
deﬁ ned and illustrated with problems and teaching 
examples that now extend to grade 6. Part 2 bal-
ances the development of mathematical knowledge 
with methods of teaching the content and skills. In 
each chapter, examples and activities illustrate ways 
in which teachers might engage children in active 
mathematical thinking and problem solving. Activi-
ties in each chapter show how students can model 
concepts with physical objects, and then record 
and communicate their actions informally as well 
as with conventional symbolism. As they construct 
meaning, students are encouraged to move toward 
mental operations that require estimation, reason-
ableness, and application of mathematical concepts 
to numerical and geometric situations.
Content standards have been presented in paired 
chapters of “developing” and “extending” concepts 
and skills over the K– 6 continuum. The “develop-
ing” chapters emphasize content typically found in 
early childhood and primary grades. The “extend-
ing” chapters focus on concepts and skills typical of 
intermediate and upper elementary grades, through 
grade 6, which many elementary schools include in 
their building and curriculum. This organization al-
lows students and teachers to address the content 
appropriate to their needs and certiﬁ cation levels.

chapters—Chapter 15, dealing with ratio and pro-
portion, and Chapter 16, thinking algebraically.
New Chapter Features
In Part 2, the reader will also ﬁ nd increased empha-
sis on diversity, technology, and assessment. Intro-
duced in Part 1, these topics are integrated through-
out the chapters in Part 2 via classroom vignettes 
and activities. In addition, each chapter in Part 2 
contains new and exciting features related to as-
sessment, technology in mathematics, and diversity 
in the classroom. Misconceptions highlight students’ 
typical misunderstandings, thus alerting teachers to 
those concepts and skills that may need particular 
attention. Multicultural Connections are suggestions 
for expanding subject matter to include topics and 
content that will appeal to the diversity in classrooms. 
Each chapter also contains representative end-of-
chapter problems from three highly-esteemed tests: 
The National Assessment of Educational Progress 
(NAEP), Trends in International Mathematics and 
Science Study (TIMSS), and Professional Assess-
ment for Beginning Teachers (Praxis).
Understanding mathematical concepts and 
building skills is within the capabilities of all future 
teachers, even if they have previously not enjoyed 
or felt conﬁ dent with mathematics. Using this text-
book invites preservice teachers to learn its content 
and methods through active engagement with the 
text, the exercises, the activities, and their peers. 
The experience of learning via this textbook mod-
els appropriate techniques that preservice teachers 
can use with their students. Many new activities are 
presented in Chapters 8– 20, and many others have 
been revised. All of the activities and assessments 
can be implemented in ﬁ eld settings.
In light of new and emerging Internet resources, 
each chapter features an Internet lesson plan, a 
description of an Internet game that focuses on 
improving mathematics skills, and references to In-
ternet sites with interactive activities through which 
students can explore chapter-related mathematics 
concepts. Each chapter also includes activities that 
are explicitly linked to each of the process standards 
highlighted by the National Council of Teachers of 
Mathematics: communication, connections, reason-
ing and proof, and representation.
Technology itself is also used to provide many new 
resources. The Guiding Children’s Learning of Math-
ematics companion website (www.thomsonedu.com/
education/kennedy) for students and instructors offers 
several features, including:
•  Downloadable black-line masters for classroom 
use
•  Essential web links for math education
•  Activities Bank with a number of useful activities 
not found in the textbook
•  PowerPoint® presentation with a talking-point out-
line for each chapter
•  NCTM Standards Spotlight, a correlation of activi-
ties in the textbook with NCTM standards

Elementary 
Mathematics for 
the 21st Century
lementary mathematics has been the subject of much discus-
sion, debate, and controversy in recent years. At the center 
of this debate is whether children should focus on basic 
computation skills or develop a wider range of knowl-
edge and skill in mathematics. The curriculum recom-
mended by the National Council of Teachers of Mathemat-
ics (2000) and adopted by many states emphasizes thinking and problem 
solving related to all mathematical topics: numbers and operations, 
statistics, measurement, probability, geometry, and algebra. The content 
is connected to living, working, and solving problems in a technological 
and information-based society. Computational skills are still important, but 
students must know when and how to use numbers to solve problems.
 
The need for a well-balanced and coherent mathematics curriculum 
prekindergarten (PK) through grade 12 was also emphasized with the pas-
sage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. This law mandated each state 
to adopt standards for academic performance and develop a testing program 
to demonstrate student achievement.
 
Just as the focus of mathematics has changed, the strategies that teach-
ers use reﬂ ect new understanding of how students learn, based on research 
on cognition—the process of learning. Teachers and parents are challenged 
to consider mathematics differently from their school mathematics expe-
rience, which was dominated by calculations and procedures, drill and 
repetition, and solitary work. An ideal classroom today ﬁ nds students work-
ing together on challenging problems related to their lives, explaining their

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Solving Problems Is Basic
Too many adults believe that they are not compe-
tent in mathematics. They may even have math-
ematics anxiety just thinking about mathematics. 
At the same time, these people use mathematics 
in their daily lives when they shop, cook, manage 
their money, work on home improvement projects, 
or plan for travel. Every citizen needs mathematical 
concepts and skills for budgeting and saving, ﬁ nanc-
ing a house or car, calculating a tip at a restaurant, 
or estimating distances and gas mileage. Often the 
numerical answer is only one factor considered in a 
decision. Other issues may be more important than 
the computed answer. Is a regular box of cereal for 
$3.75 a better buy than the smaller box for $2.75 or 
the giant box for $4.75 (Figure 1.1)? Does having a 
“50 cents off” coupon change the answer? What 
other factors inﬂ uence the choice of cereal?
E X E RC I S E
Using the information in Figure 1.1, work in groups 
of two or three to solve the cereal problem. Which 
box of cereal would you buy based on cost? Does a 
coupon change your decision? If the store doubles 
the coupon, does that change the decision? What 
else would you consider when deciding which cereal 
to buy? •••
Calculations are only part of solving problems 
in mathematics. Reasoning is used to decide how 
much cost, taste, and nutrition are considered in 
the ﬁ nal decision. Even after complex calculations, 
such as the cost of remodeling or the various incen-
tives offered for buying a car, the numerical answer 
is only one of many other factors involved.
Adults, even those who believe they were not 
good in school mathematics, often develop math-
ematical skills in their jobs. Carpenters and con-
tractors measure accurately and estimate job costs 
and materials. Accountants, graphic designers, and 
hospital workers use calculators and computers 
routinely to record and analyze information and 
designs. When mathematics is applied to realistic 
life and work situations, many adults ﬁ nd that they 
are capable in mathematics, despite their negative 
attitudes toward mathematics in school. The need 
to connect mathematics to realistic situations has 
been one motivation for reform of the mathematics 
curriculum and teaching.
The vision of mathematics has changed. Math-
ematics used to be a solitary activity done primarily

show what they understand and can do.
In this chapter you will read about:
 Problem solving as the central idea in school mathematics
 How the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000) serves as a model for
what mathematics should be taught and how it should be taught
 Six principles that provide a foundation for school mathematics from
preschool through grade 12: mathematics curriculum, equity, teach-
ing, learning, assessment, and technology

on worksheets. Now teachers ask students to work to-
gether to solve interesting problems, puzzles, games, 
and investigations. When solving these problems, 
students develop the concepts, skills, and attitudes 
needed for life and work. Numbers and calculation 
are still essential, but mathematical thinking and rea-
soning equip all children to solve a wide variety of 
problems.
Elementary mathematics teachers are on the 
front line of the effort to develop mathematical con-
cepts and problem-solving skills. Classroom events 
provide mathematical learning experiences.
•  If juice boxes are packaged in groups of three, 
how many packs are needed for 20 children?
•  How much money is needed to buy lunch, a 
snack, and a pencil at the school store?
•  Is January a good month to take a ﬁ eld trip to the 
zoo? Why or why not?
•  Will this 12  15 inch piece of paper be large 
enough to cover a cube for my art project?
•  How many children prefer hamburgers to pizza? 
Hamburgers to hot dogs? Pizza to hot dogs?
Students ﬁ gure out what information they need and 
how to use it to solve problems.
Problem-focused teachers ask, “Is there only 
one answer? Can anyone see another way to solve 
this problem?” As students discover problems with 
multiple answers and multiple solution paths, they 
become more ﬂ exible in their thinking. When prob-
lems serve as the context of teaching, children ask, 
“Does this answer make sense?” Information from 
print and electronic sources is represented in many 
forms: text, pictures, tables, and graphs. Students 
learn as they write, draw, act, read about, and model 
their thinking. They engage in dialogue, demonstra-
tion, and debate about mathematical ideas. When 
children are actively engaged in doing mathemati-
cal tasks, they are thinking about how mathematics 
works. This new vision of mathematics includes a 
balanced mathematics program for students of all 
ages that focuses on concepts, processes, and ap-
plications, with problem solving at its core.
Public and political concern about student 
achievement is another factor that inﬂ uences the 
development of new mathematics curriculum and 
teaching. As a result, national and state policymak-
ers demand more accountability of schools and 
teachers for student learning. The No Child Left 
Behind Act of 2001 requires that states adopt stan-
dards-based curricula. The standards provide com-
mon expectations for student performance, and 
statewide testing has been developed to measure 
student progress. Results are used to rate and rank 
schools based on student achievement. If schools 
do not meet performance standards, sanctions may 
be imposed under the act. Teachers also must dem-
onstrate knowledge of content and teaching prac-
tices to meet “highly qualiﬁ ed” requirements under 
No Child Left Behind. The provisions of the act are 
controversial, and debate continues on the local, 
state, and national levels.
A Comprehensive Vision 
of Mathematics
The effort to improve mathematics education was 
based on several factors. School mathematics has 
been seen by many learners as irrelevant and bor-
ing when mathematics is actually useful and ex-
citing when learned conceptually and practically. 
Research has accelerated the information available 
about how mathematics is learned and effectively 
taught. Political demands for a standard curriculum 
and increased assessment required a response from 
the mathematics education community.
The opportunity and challenge to formulate 
this new vision of mathematics was met by the Na-
tional Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). 
For nearly a century, NCTM has sought to answer 
two central questions for teachers, parents, and 
policymakers:
•  What mathematical concepts and skills are funda-
mental for students to know?
•  What are the best ways to teach and learn these 
essential concepts and skills?
NCTM, an international professional organization 
of more than 100,000 professionals in mathemat-
ics education, provides resources and guidance to 
teachers, schools, school districts, and state and 
national policymakers through policy recommen-
dations and publications. In 2000, the NCTM Board 
of Directors and members adopted Principles and 

6 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Standards for School Mathematics. This comprehen-
sive and balanced statement describes principles 
to guide mathematics programs and outlines the 
content and processes central to teaching and learn-
ing mathematics (the report is available at http://www
.nctm.org).
The new standards consolidated curriculum, 
teaching, and assessment issues into one document. 
Core beliefs, called principles, are addressed directly 
in the new standards. Standards are organized into 
four grade bands (PK– 2, 3– 5, 6– 8, and 9– 12) that 
address unique characteristics of mathematics con-
tent and learning needs of children throughout their 
school years. Five content standards and ﬁ ve pro-
cess standards are common across all grade levels, 
showing the unity of mathematics knowledge and 
process.
Principles of School Mathematics
The principles surround all aspects of planning and 
teaching. Table 1.1 lists each NCTM principle and 
issues related to it. Teachers can ask themselves 
whether they are following the principles as they 
reﬂ ect on their teaching.
TABLE 1.1 • Six Principles for School Mathematics
Equity Principle
Excellence in mathematics education requires equity—high expectations and strong support for all students.
•  Equity requires high expectations and worthwhile opportunities for all.
•  Equity requires accommodating differences to help everyone learn mathematics.
•  Equity requires resources and support for all classrooms and students.
Mathematics Curriculum Principle
A curriculum is more than a collection of activities:
•  A mathematics curriculum should be coherent.
•  A mathematics curriculum should focus on important mathematics.
•  A mathematics curriculum should be well articulated across the grades.
Teaching Principle
Effective mathematics teaching requires understanding what students know and need to learn and then challenging and 
supporting students to learn it well.
•  Effective teaching requires knowing and understanding mathematics, students as learners, and pedagogical strategies.
•  Effective teaching requires a challenging and supportive classroom-learning environment.
•  Effective teaching requires continually seeking improvement.
Learning Principle
Students must learn mathematics with understanding, actively building new knowledge from experience and prior 
knowledge.
•  Learning mathematics with understanding is essential.
•  Students can learn mathematics with understanding.
Assessment Principle
Assessment should support the learning of important mathematics and furnish useful information to both teachers and 
students.
• Assessment should enhance students’ learning.
• Assessment is a valuable tool for making instructional decisions.
Technology Principle
Technology is essential in teaching and learning mathematics; it inﬂ uences the mathematics that is taught and enhances 
students’ learning.
• Technology enhances mathematics learning.
• Technology supports effective mathematics teaching.
• Technology inﬂ uences what mathematics is taught.

•  Curriculum: Do all children receive a well-
rounded and balanced program in mathematics?
•  Equity: Do all children have access and opportu-
nities to be successful in mathematics?
•  Learning: Are the methods I use based on what is 
known about how children learn?
•  Teaching: Do the methods I use enhance learning 
by engaging children in mathematical thinking, 
developing concepts and skills, and applying their 
knowledge to engaging problems?
•  Assessment: Do I use assessment to determine 
children’s strengths and needs on a continuous 
basis and adjust my instruction accordingly?
•  Technology: Do I use technology to help children 
explore and learn mathematical concepts?
These six principles should be integrated into every 
mathematics lesson (Figure 1.2).
well-balanced mathematics curriculum includes 
ﬁ ve content standards and ﬁ ve process standards 
taught across all grades, PK– 12.
Common standards emphasize the unity and 
interrelatedness of mathematics knowledge and 
process (Table 1.2). The content standards are or-
ganized in four grade bands (PK– 2, 3– 5, 6– 8, and 
9– 12) that address unique characteristics of content 
and cognitive development of learners. The com-
plete curriculum with grade band expectations is 
found in Appendix A. In this text, we emphasize the 
ﬁ rst two grade bands, PK– 2 and grades 3– 5, with 
additional attention to grade 6 because it is often 
included in elementary certiﬁ cation and school or-
ganization. In Chapter 2 we present each of the con-
tent and process standards with descriptions of how 
they are integrated into daily teaching. Standards 
and expectations are also discussed in the appro-
priate chapters in Part 2 of the text as content and 
activities are introduced for each topic.
The Equity Principle
Equity means that the full mathematics curriculum, 
balanced with content and process, is available 
to all students. Students in schools possess many 
characteristics. They may be male or female; rep-
resent many different cultures, ethnic groups, and 
languages; and possess a variety of background ex-
periences, mathematical interests, and abilities. De-
spite the differences among students, they all need 
mathematics to carry out daily tasks, to work, and 
to be informed citizens in a technological world. 
Rather than being a gate or ﬁ lter that allows only

The Mathematics Curriculum Principle
The mathematics curriculum principle describes es-
sential mathematics concepts and skills that NCTM 
believes are important for children to learn from pre-
school through grade 12. This comprehensive and 
E

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
a few students to move forward, equity emphasizes 
that the mathematics door is open to all students 
from the ﬁ rst day of their education and through-
out their lives. All students need opportunities to 
develop technical, vocational, and practical math-
ematics and to develop reasoning skills.
Equity does not mean that every student receives 
exactly the same program. It means that no child 
is deprived of the opportunity to learn; no arbitrary 
limits are set on individuals. Because students have 
different goals, abilities, and interests, mathemat-
ics must address individual needs as well. Gifted 
students need opportunities to explore beyond the 
basic curriculum. Students who experience difﬁ cul-
ties in mathematics need extra assistance to attain 
the knowledge and skills outlined in the standards. 
When instruction is ﬂ exible enough to allow chil-
dren the time and resources to explore topics of spe-
cial interest to them, it serves all students. In Chapter 
3 we discuss how to provide a challenging and com-
prehensive mathematical program for all students.
The Learning Principle
Understanding how children learn is the foundation 
of teaching; teachers must understand learning the-
ories to design appropriate instructional activities. 
Current research supports effective teaching prac-
tices such as discussion and writing in mathemat-
ics, active engagement with signiﬁ cant mathemati-
cal tasks, higher order thinking about mathematical 
problems, and use of models, materials, and mul-
tiple representations of mathematical concepts. 
In Chapter 4 we present knowledge from learning 
theories and research about effective teaching and 
learning in classrooms as a coherent guide for orga-
nizing instruction.
The Teaching Principle
Teaching is directly related to learning. Knowing 
how students learn leads to teaching techniques 
that help students to develop an understanding of 
mathematical concepts, think strategically about 
problems, and develop strong process skills. Teach-
ers consider many things as they make many deci-
sions about instruction: grade-level standards, goals 
and progress for each child, strategies and activities, 
materials, time and space, and grouping of children. 
Their decisions and choices determine the climate 
of the classroom and the nature of the mathematical 
conversation they encourage. Some choices limit 
the conversation, interaction, and collaboration; 
other choices encourage dialogue, demonstration, 
and engagement. In Chapter 5 we make sugges-
tions for developing a mathematics classroom that 
encourages student involvement. In the chapters in 
Part 2, we present lessons, activities, and ideas for 
teaching content and process.
The Assessment Principle
Instead of giving tests at the end of each reporting 
period, the assessment principle envisions continu-
ous interaction between learner and teacher before, 
during, and after instruction. Assessment occurs 
daily through asking questions and observing stu-
dent work, by reviewing written work done in class 
or at home, by monitoring activities and exercises, 
by reading and responding to journals, and by re-
viewing portfolios and projects. Some assessments 
are snapshots of knowledge so that teachers can 
make daily adaptations to instruction. Projects al-
low students to integrate skills and knowledge in a 
more integrated and practical situation. Portfolios 
and journals show growth over time. In Chapter 7 we 
present many different techniques that can be used 
to collect information about student knowledge and 
skill, and we exemplify these techniques throughout 
Part 2 of the text.
The Technology Principle
Many parents and teachers fear that technology in-
hibits children’s skill with computation. Technology 
is not a substitute for knowing numbers and opera-
tions or for building fundamental concepts; instead, 
technology is a tool for learning and applying math-
ematical concepts. Computers and calculators can 
help children learn mathematics in powerful and 
meaningful ways.
In a ﬁ rst-grade classroom, students dis-
covered that when they keyed in 5  and 
repeatedly touched , the calculator dis-
played 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. . . . The students 
started skip counting by 5’s as the display 
guided their chant. Irma noticed that all 
the numbers ended in 0 or 5 and were in 
two horizontal lines on the hundreds chart. 

 
Chapter 1 Elementary Mathematics for the 21st Century 
9
Some children experimented with 25  or 
100  as the starting number. Racing for 
the biggest number, they found that larger 
starting numbers grew in length very fast.
One child got an error message; then they 
all wanted to get “ERROR” and to learn what
that meant.
The children were deeply engaged with numbers: 
how to count in different ways, when is a number 
too big for the calculator, and multiplication. The 
calculator became a tool for exploration of math-
ematics concepts instead of being limited to check-
ing answers. The challenge is ﬁ nding ways to inte-
grate technology into a learning event.
Technology also changes what is taught and 
the time spent on topics. How many problems of 
multiplication and division are required after stu-
dents demonstrate understanding of the meaning 
and process? Do children really need to learn the 
algorithm for square root? When a calculator has a 
built-in graphing program, how many hand-drawn 
graphs are required? Teachers must reconsider both 
what content is taught and the time needed for prac-
tice and reallocate time to teaching concepts and
problem solving. In Chapter 6 we extend the discus-
sion of technology use for learning mathematics.
Implementing the Principles
and Standards
The principles and standards provide the vision of
what mathematics can and should be for elemen-
tary students. Since adoption of the standards in
2000, teachers have worked to implement the vi-
sion through their instruction. The purpose of this
textbook is to provide content background and ex-
amples of teaching for beginning and experienced
teachers. In Chapters 2 through 7 we develop the
six principles through discussion and examples
of their classroom implementation. In Chapters 8
through 20 we focus on mathematics curriculum by
describing activities and processes that give life to
the principles and standards each day for elemen-
tary students.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Consider your own mathematics experiences in 
schools. Were your experiences consistent with the 
NCTM principles?
  •  Did you have a well-balanced curriculum?
  •  Were all students provided opportunity and sup-
port to be successful?
  •  Did teachers use a variety of teaching techniques 
that motivated and challenged each student’s 
learning?
  •  Was technology used to enhance your learning 
mathematics?
  •  Did teachers assess your learning frequently with a 
variety of techniques?
 2.  Recall your experiences in mathematics. Does your 
background illustrate positive or negative examples 
of the principles?
 3.  Do a web search about the No Child Left Behind 
Act, and locate sources that support the act and 
those that express reservations. What are the major 
requirements of No Child Left Behind? What are the 
speciﬁ c areas of disagreement and concern? Are 
there any points of agreement?

Defining a

Mathematics 
Curriculum
he vision of mathematics presented in the Principles and 
Standards for School Mathematics (National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics, 2000) emphasizes thinking 
and problem solving within a well-balanced curricu-
lum of content knowledge and process skills for PK–12 
students. Students are actively engaged in interesting and 
meaningful activities to develop mathematics concepts and build criti-
cal skills while solving problems. In this chapter we describe the National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) content and process standards 
through classroom vignettes and examples that demonstrate how content 
and process standards are developed in student-centered classrooms.
In this chapter you will read about:

CHAPTER 2

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Connecting Concepts, Skills, 
and Application
The NCTM curriculum standards present a compre-
hensive overview of what students should know and 
be able to do in mathematics as they progress in 
school from PK through grade 12. Instead of mem-
orizing procedures and deﬁ nitions out of context, 
students learn concepts and mathematical proce-
dures through problems that require mathematical 
reasoning.
The NCTM standards provide a model for many 
state-adopted mathematics standards-based cur-
ricula. When ﬁ rst looking at state standards, teach-
ers may feel overwhelmed if they believe that each 
standard is an isolated topic or skill. However, the 
standards actually encourage teachers to build con-
nections and relationships among concepts, skills, 
and applications in mathematics and other subject 
areas. In one lesson or activity, several related con-
cepts or skills can be introduced, developed, or re-
viewed. Classroom vignettes and examples in this 
chapter illustrate how teachers connect mathemat-
ics concepts with each other, with other subjects, 
and with children’s interests and experiences.
What Elementary Children Need 
to Know in Mathematics
The ﬁ ve content standards and ﬁ ve process stan-
dards in the NCTM standards identify the content 
knowledge and the mathematical processes de-
veloped over the PK–12 curriculum. In this chapter 
we explain the importance and meaning of both 
TABLE 2.1 • Mathematics Curriculum Principle: Content Standards

content and process standards. Tables 2.1 and 2.2 
provide an overview of the content standards and 
the process standards, respectively. In Appendix A 
the content standards for students’ mathematical 
growth and proﬁ ciency across four grade bands 
include expectations that provide benchmarks for 
teachers. In Part 2 of the textbook we provide activi-
ties, lessons, and examples that show how content 
is taught within the framework provided by the pro-
cess standards. Rather than being separate topics, 
the process standards are integrated into lessons 
and activities presented to children.
Numbers and Number Operations
Learning about numbers and number operations 
has been and still is a central element of elementary 
school mathematics. Although computational pro-
ﬁ ciency is essential, understanding how numbers 
work and reasoning about numbers, called number 
sense and computational ﬂ uency, respectively, are 
emphasized. Rather than memorizing isolated facts 
and procedures, students construct understandings 
about numbers and number systems as the founda-
tion for learning operations, facts, and procedures.
For children, understanding numbers progresses 
from counting objects and matching sets with nu-
merals, to using objects, pictures, and symbols that 
represent place values for tens, hundreds, even mil-
lions and billions. Concepts of addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division begin with stories about 
everyday events using simple numbers. The stories 
provide the problems that are solved through ac-
tion, pictures, and number sentences. Stories with 
larger numbers or fractions draw on understand-

Problem Solving
Instructional programs from PK through grade 12 should enable all students to
•  Build new mathematical knowledge through problem solving
•  Solve problems that arise in mathematics and other contexts
•  Apply and adapt a variety of appropriate strategies to solve problems
•  Monitor and reﬂ ect on the process of mathematical problem solving
Reasoning and Proof
Instructional programs from PK through grade 12 should enable all students to
•  Recognize reasoning and proof as fundamental aspects of mathematics
•  Make and investigate mathematical conjectures
•  Develop and evaluate mathematical arguments
•  Select and use various types of reasoning and methods of proof
Communication
Instructional programs from PK through grade 12 should enable all students to
•  Organize and consolidate their mathematical thinking through communication
•  Communicate their mathematical thinking coherently and clearly to peers, teachers, and others
•  Analyze and evaluate the mathematical thinking and strategies of others
•  Use the language of mathematics to express mathematical ideas precisely
Connections

•  Recognize and use connections among mathematical ideas
•  Understand how mathematical ideas interconnect and build on one another to produce a coherent whole
•  Recognize and apply mathematics in context outside of mathematics
Representation
Instructional programs from PK through grade 12 should enable all students to
•  Create and use representations to organize, record, and communicate mathematical ideas
•  Select, apply, and translate among mathematical representations to solve problems
•  Use representations to model and interpret physical, social, and mathematical phenomena

ing of operations and allow students to solve prob-
lems. Computational ﬂ uency is the ultimate goal for 
students, because they can solve problems using 
paper-and-pencil techniques, technology, or esti-
mation or mental computation. They should know 
which computational technique is most appropriate 
and how precise they need to be to get a reason-
able answer. Throughout the development of num-
ber sense, thinking about numbers is emphasized so 
that students can solve more complex problems, jus-
tify their strategy, and explain whether the answer is 
reasonable.
While students learn about numbers, they can 
also be learning about other standards. In this pri-
mary-grade vignette, a teacher bridges from number 
facts to an algebraic number pattern.
Ms. Munoz shows two beads on a string 
(Figure 2.1), then adds three more beads. 
She asks students what number sentence to 
write, and students suggest 2  3  5. With 
standing of number operations and algebra 
but also integrates processes of problem 
solving, representation, reasoning, and com-
munication into the lesson.
E X E RC I S E
Why would the teacher ask students to generate 
rules for number operations? How is making a rule 
different from learning the addition and subtrac-
tion facts? •••
Geometry
Geometry and spatial sense are central mathemati-
cal ideas in our three-dimensional world. Many 
activities—playing sports, driving, gardening, key-
boarding—require spatial sense. People use spatial 
awareness when they arrange furniture, pack bag-
gage, and wrap presents. Artists, architects, and en-
gineers create sophisticated and aesthetic products 
that use an understanding of geometry.
Many mathematical concepts are represented 
with geometry. The number line is a one-dimen-
sional model for addition and subtraction. A map is 
a two-dimensional grid representation showing rela-
tive locations of buildings, streets, and cities. The 
same two-dimensional coordinate grid is used for 
graphing algebraic equations and showing area.
In elementary mathematics, children learn 
about geometry and develop spatial sense in their 
environment. They ﬁ nd relationships among shapes 
and angles as they explore their world. Geometry 
activities activate creativity, problem solving, and 
reasoning in students’ pictures and designs, such as 
quilt patterns.
Kai watches his grandmother use the “dia-
mond in a square” pattern to make a quilt 
(Figure 2.2). He ﬁ nds graph paper and starts 
drawing the quilt designs with squares and 
triangles. He ﬁ nds that the triangles are re-
ally larger squares rotated 45 degrees around 
the center square. He has to ﬁ gure out how 
long the side of each new square is and no-
tices that the sides get longer, but the angles 
stay the same.
When Kai takes his quilt to school, his third-
grade teacher, Ms. Scott, recognizes that quilts are 
a good way to integrate geometry, art, and measure-
E

blocks at their desks, children create more 
examples of adding 3, draw pictures of their 
blocks, and write other number sentences. 
After recording several sentences on the
board, she asks: “What is 5 plus 3? What is 8
plus 3? What is 12 plus 3?” Using a hundreds 
chart, students mark a starting number with
a green chip and put a red chip on “plus
3.” After several examples, Ms. Munoz asks
if they see a pattern for “plus 3,” and they 
respond that plus 3 is like counting 3 more.
Finally, she says, “I am thinking of a mystery
number. Now I add 3 and have 26. What 
was the mystery number?” Children put the 
red chip on 26 and count down 3 to ﬁ nd 23.
They continue ﬁ nding mystery numbers with 
partners. The teacher asks children to gen-
eralize a rule for adding 3 that encourages
them to think about how numbers work. 
Asking about a mystery number, Ms. Munoz 
engages children in algebraic thinking x  3

In the sixth grade, Ms. Ledford ﬁ nds quilt pat-
terns with 3-4-5 triangles to introduce similar 
triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. To 
extend her students’ understanding, she takes 
the class outside, where she has placed a 2-
meter upright bar in the ground that is casting 
a 1.5-meter shadow (Fig ure 2.3). She asks the 
students how they could use this information 
to estimate the height of the oak tree in the 
school yard. This lesson involves students in 
problem solving, calculations, algebraic rea-
soning, and connecting geometric principles 
to the real world.
E

What is the approximate height of the tree shown in 
Figure 2.3? How does this activity connect geometry 
with measurement? •••
Measurement
People measure length, area, volume and capacity, 
mass, angle, time, temperature, and money nearly 
every day. Likewise, elementary school children 
learn measurement concepts and skills through their 
daily activities. They weigh fruit and vegetables on 
a variety of scales. They measure the length of the 
hall, the room, and their bodies. They use television 
or bus schedules to plan activities. They measure 
angles and areas when creating art projects. Mea-
surement is a natural activity for students, and the 
concepts and skills of measurement, such as itera-
tion, benchmarks for common units, approximation, 
and precision, develop through these experiences.
Measuring the area of rectangles (Figure 2.4) 
may begin as a counting exercise, but students soon 
realize that multiplication is a faster way to deter-
mine the area. When area is represented as a multi-
plication fact—4  6  24—they have the ﬁ rst step 
of an algebraic formula (length  width  area) to 
represent any rectangular area.

count shows compounding interest. Telling time is 
a basic skill for organizing life activities, and ther-
mometers are essential tools for weather and per-
sonal health. Comparison shopping is done with 
ﬂ yers from newspapers, catalogs, and advertise-
ments. Sy Ning uses her knowledge of measurement 
to decide which pizza is the best deal for the Liu 
family.
Sy Ning compares the price of small, me-
dium, and large pizzas (Figure 2.5). She 
estimates the area of each pizza using pr 2, 
approximating p  3. She concludes that 
the area of the 12-inch pizza is more than 
twice that of the 8-inch pizza, but the price 
is less than double. Because one large pizza 
costs almost $5.00 less than two small ones, 
the family buys a large pizza with one-half 
cheese and pepperoni and one-half vegetar-
ian toppings.
Data Analysis and Probability
In an information age, data are often organized and 
presented in the form of tables and graphs. Newspa-
pers display information in charts, and content read-
ing in social studies and science depends on inter-
pretation of graphical information. Graphs showing 
average temperature and average rainfall help stu-
dents understand the climatic differences between 
a desert and a rainforest.
By organizing, displaying, and analyzing infor-
mation that they have collected, students learn how 
to interpret data and draw conclusions. Children 
collect information about birthdays, favorite pizza, 
letters in names, hair color, and height of plants 
grown from seeds. They turn these data into tables, 
charts, and graphs. When students have collected 
information from their classmates and the students 
in the next class, they can compare and contrast the 
information gathered.
E X E RC I S E
Find a table, chart, or graph in a newspaper. Write 
three to ﬁ ve questions about the information 
displayed, including both factual and inferential 
questions. Trade with classmates to answer the 
questions they have written. What did you learn 
from the activity? •••
Probability is the study of chance—how likely an 
event will occur. Forecasting weather involves prob-
ability based on atmospheric conditions. Health 
and auto insurance premiums are calculated for 
different people on the likelihood of their having 
illnesses or being involved in an accident. Under-
standing chance is an important mathematical con-
cept for understanding many aspects of life. Prob-
ability experiments also provide opportunities for 
data collection.
After the experiment of rolling one die 60 times 
(Figure 2.6), students see that the expected and the 
observed results are not exactly the same, but when 
they add all the results from all the groups, they ﬁ nd 
that the expectation of equal probability for each 
number is quite accurate. Before students roll two 
dice 60 times and record their results in a chart, 
Mr. King asks them to predict how many of each 
sum they will roll. Based on their previous experi-
ment, they predict 5 of each number 1 through 12.

Solving the problem involved more than calcula-

Making a schedule with routine and special events
uses the clock and calendar as tools. Charting

rolling one die compare to those of the students? 
What happens when you combine all the results in 
the class? Based on your experiment with two dice, 
what problems did the students ﬁ nd with their 
predictions? •••
The newspaper reported that the state lottery 
was worth $157 million, and ﬁ fth-grade stu-
dents wanted to know how people could win. 
Mrs. Imari asked students what they knew 
about the lottery. When she found they had 
little understanding, she decided to introduce 
probability experiments and simulations.
The next day, 
Mrs. Imari introduced a 
bag with 99 yellow chips 
and 1 red chip (Figure 
2.7). Each child removed 
a chip, recorded the 
color, and put it back in 
the bag. Only 2 students 
out of 117 students in the 
ﬁ fth grade had drawn 
a red chip. The ratio of 
2 to 117 meant that the 
chance of getting a red 
chip was about 1 in 60 
compared to the actual 
ratio of 1 red to 99 yel-
low. Next, in a learning 
center, students experi-
mented by drawing one 
chip from a bag holding 
999 yellow chips and 
1 red chip; no student 
E
picked a red chip. After other sampling 
exercises with objects and computer simula-
tions, students concluded that as the number 
of chips increases, the chance of winning is 
reduced. When they talked about the lottery, 
they saw that the chance of picking six win-
ning numbers out of all the possible combi-
nations meant that any one person would 
have a very low probability of winning. The 
lottery ticket states that the chance of win-
ning is 1 in 16,000,000, or 0.00000000625—
close to zero probability.
Activities and lessons with data and probability 
are engaging for students. Students enjoy taking sur-
veys and comparing results. They enjoy rolling dice, 
spinning spinners, and drawing chips from a bag. 
These activities are also easy to integrate into other 
subject lessons.

you calculate the probability of drawing those two 
numbers in sequence? •••
Algebra
Algebra has been the traditional topic for high 
school mathematics, but the 2000 NCTM standards 
included algebra as a priority for all grades. Although 
algebraic concepts and thinking have been embed-
ded in elementary mathematics, they were not rec-
ognized or well developed. Concepts of patterns, 
relationships, change, variability, and equality are 
fundamental to the study of numbers, operations, 
geometry, measurement, and data. Algebra is just 
one more step when a teacher asks students to use 
their observations to create a general rule, predict, 
estimate, and reason about missing information. A 
kindergarten class performs algebra when they ana-
lyze a pattern and represent it in many forms.
Ms. McDowell’s children in kindergarten 
can ﬁ nd, read, label, and extend patterns of 
pictures and shapes. She wants them to rep-
resent patterns in other ways. She asks them 
how to act out the shape pattern—circle-

square-triangle, circle-square-triangle—us-
ing actions and sounds. They respond with 
snap-clap-stomp and animal sounds: “woof-
meow-oink.” She asks how many different 
sounds or actions are in each sequence, they 
reply “three.” Finally, she asks if they could 
write the sequence using letters. They de-
cide they would need three different letters 
(Figure 2.8).
Patterns are the beginning of algebraic thinking. 
Collecting observations about concrete models in a 
table makes number patterns and sequences more 
apparent.

Work with a partner to represent a pattern of your 
own in ﬁ ve different ways: shape, picture, sound,

Students in the fourth 
grade at Viejo Elementary 
School build a triangle-
shaped tower with cubes 
(Figure 2.9a). They count 
the number of blocks on each level: 3, 5, 7, 
9, . . . , and the total number. They note that 
each row increases by 2 and predict that 
the next row will have 11 blocks in it. They 
predict the total will be 35 because 24  
11  35; then they build the next level and 
conﬁ rm their reasoning. Mrs. Simmons chal-
lenges them to answer the question “How 
E
many total blocks would be in a tower hav-
ing 10 rows?” without building all 10 rows. 
The students organize their results in a table 
(Figure 2.9b) to ﬁ nd a pattern. The explora-
tion was not over because a student was 
puzzled.
The next day, Yolanda 
asked why the top row was 
missing. Mrs. Simmons 
asked if that would change 
their results. When they put 
one cube on the top (Fig -
ure 2.9c), they found a different pattern (Fig -
ure 2.9d). Sebastian said that the totals of the 
blocks 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . . were squared num-
bers because they were the result of multi-
plying a number by itself: 1  1, 2  2, 3 

blocks would be 100 because 10  10  100. 
Mrs. Simmons asked how many blocks it 
would take to build a triangle shape with 20, 
50, and 100 rows. Then she asked her stu-
dents to compare their tables to see if they 
could ﬁ nd a formula for the total number of 
blocks in the ﬁ rst tower.
E X E RC I S E
What would be the total number of blocks needed 
to complete the tower with 12 rows—without the 
top block and with the top block? •••
Through exploration with a concrete model, stu-
dents found several patterns and ways to represent 
the towers. Algebraic teaching and algebraic think-
ing occurs every time students ask questions about 
combinations and possibilities.
•  What comes next?
•  What is missing?
•  What would happen if . . . ?
•  If this changed, what would happen?
Opportunities for ﬁ nding and extending patterns, 
using variables, observing change, and using sym-
bolic notation are found in almost every lesson.
Learning Mathematical Processes
The ﬁ ve process standards (see Table 2.2) empha-
size how children learn and think about mathemat-
ics. The process standards are threaded through the 
content standards emphasizing the context for learn-
ing mathematics. The ﬁ ve process standards intro-
duced in this chapter are integrated into Part Two of 
this book with content activities and lessons.
Problem Solving
Many people recall learning mathematics by memo-
rizing facts followed with a few word problems at 
the end of the unit or chapter. In a modern math-
ematics program, problems are not an afterthought. 
Instead, children begin with stories and situations 
that require them to develop concepts and skills to 
solve problems. In “learning through problem solv-
ing” (Schroeder & Lester, 1989), real-life and simu-
lated problem situations provide context and reason 
for learning mathematics. Problem solving is the 
central goal of mathematics instruction.
E
Students need a variety of engaging experiences 
to develop proﬁ ciency in problem solving. Newer 
elementary textbooks and supplemental materials 
implement the standards with many stories and situ-
ational problems for students and teachers to solve. 
Puzzles and games also develop problem-solving 
strategies. Interesting problems are also found in 
newspapers or on the Internet. An article about the 
world’s largest dormitory (Hoppe, 1999) included 
statistics about the largest dormitory in the United 
States at the University of Texas. A listing of the gal-
lons of water used, pounds of cereal and dozens of 
eggs eaten, and tons of garbage hauled away gen-
erated questions about consumption and waste at 
school and at home. These topics became math-
ematical investigations connected to science and 
social studies.
Many good problems are encountered in class-
rooms throughout the school year. Teachers and 
students identify problems and investigate alterna-
tive solutions.
•  A class needs sashes for a school program. Each 
sash has three stripes of different-colored mate-
rial, and each stripe is 4 inches wide and 48 
inches long. How many sashes are needed? How 
many yards of each color of material are needed? 
What is the cost of 1 yard of material? What will 
be the cost of all the sashes?
•  Two computers are in the classroom. How can 
everybody get a turn? What is the best way to 
schedule the computers with the least interrup-
tion of other activities?
•  A class is investigating climatic changes in its re-
gion of the country. What is the average monthly 
rainfall for the past 5 years? How do these aver-
ages compare with the same averages for the past 
100 years? Has the average for any given month 
changed? How has temperature changed over the 
past 100 years?
•  A class is studying nutrition as part of a health 
unit. What number of calories is recommended 
for girls in the class? for boys? What ratio of calo-
ries from fats to total calories is recommended? 
What is the average daily intake of calories of 
each child in the class? How are the calories for 
each child distributed among the food types? 
How much does each child’s calorie intake vary 
from what is recommended?

20 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Realistic and open-ended problems invite realistic 
and open-ended problem solving. Nonroutine prob-
lems involve important mathematics concepts and 
skills. Classroom investigations are called problem-
based learning. Thorp and Sage (1999) describe 
problem-based learning as “focused, experiential 
learning (minds-on, hands-on) organized around 
the investigation and resolution of messy, real-world 
problems.” By creating a “learning adventure,” teach-
ers work with students to solve problems with mean-
ing. All the sources of problems contribute to the 
development of problem solving and provide a vari-
ety of problems for student engagement. In Chapter 
8 we introduce some problem-solving strategies that 
are used by children and adults when they encoun-
ter problems.
Reasoning and Proof
Elementary students demonstrate reasoning and 
proof when they explain their thinking. In the con-
text of mathematics-rich activities and problems, 
students tell, show, write, draw, and act out what 
they are doing and explain why. By providing expe-
riences for students to construct their own solutions 
and understandings, teachers encourage children’s 
thinking.
The teacher may ini-
tiate problems that are 
rich with mathematical 
concepts or follow up on 
a student interest. The 
lottery vignette describes 
a real-life problem of in-
terest to students. Stu-
dents experienced simple 
samples, then more com-
plex samples, and drew 
conclusions based on the 
data and evidence they generated. Throughout the 
investigations, they predicted, hypothesized, con-
jectured, and reasoned using data.
During learning, children often have partial un-
derstanding or misconceptions. Young children 
are preoperational, meaning that their thinking is 
strongly inﬂ uenced by visual impressions.
Mariel, age 5, has learned to identify 
squares, rectangles, circles, and triangles. 
The triangle shape used in her classroom is 
an equilateral triangle (Figure 2.10a). When 
introduced to another triangle, she refuses 
to name it a triangle. The name is limited by 
her understanding of “triangles.”
As students develop cognitively, they reason 
more ﬂ exibly. Classiﬁ cation based on the relation-
ship between shapes is a powerful reasoning pro-
cess. After working with a set of triangles, third grad-
ers recognize that some attributes are common to 
all triangles and that some characteristics identify 
speciﬁ c triangles. One writes a journal entry ex-
plaining what the cooperative group decided about 
triangles.
All triangles have three sides and three 
angles. Equilateral triangles are special 
because they have three congruent sides 
and three congruent angles of 60 degrees. 
Right triangles are special because they all 
have one right angle. If right triangles have 
two sides the same length, they are isosceles 
right triangles. Scalene triangles have no 
congruent sides. Scalene triangles might 
also be right triangles.
Teachers encourage mathematical discourse by 
asking open-ended questions based on mathemati-
cal tasks that engage students’ interest and thinking. 
Teachers must resist the temptation to provide quick 
and easy answers. Instead, they should ask students 
to explain their reasoning whether the answer is 
correct or not. Errors are opportunities for students 
to develop reasoning and sound mathematical con-
cepts. Disagreements and arguments are important 
in a classroom that encourages thinking.

Communication
The NCTM principles and standards challenge teach-
ers to organize classrooms so that they promote 
communication and collaboration. Mathematics is 
often remembered as a solitary exercise of writing 
answers in workbooks or worksheets. Today, talk-
ing, reading, writing, acting, building, and drawing 
are valued ways of learning mathematics.
Communication is as fundamental to learning 
mathematics as it is to reading and language arts. 
In every lesson, children share their thinking and 
improve their reasoning through oral discussions, 
written descriptions, journals, tables, charts, and 
graphs. In the vignette about block towers, students 
constructed models and counted blocks. Data 
placed in tables led to conclusions, predictions, and 
new questions. Students who snap, clap, and stomp 
various patterns are communicating understanding 
of sequence and repetition that they then symbol-
ize with pictures and symbols. As children listen to 
explanations and solutions, they hear alternative 
ways of thinking and may 
clarify their ideas.
In the real world, peo-
ple often work together 
on common goals or 
problems. The elementary 
classroom models coop-
erative efforts of informa-
tion sharing and task fo-
cus. A new play area calls 
on children to collaborate 
and negotiate the design. 
Each grade level could 
work on the task and 
make recommendations 
using diagrams and writ-
ten explanations.
•  A new surface is being put on the school’s play-
ground, and markings for old activities will be 
covered. What game and activity spaces should 
be laid out on the new surface? What is the best 
way to lay out the spaces for the least possible 
interference among players of different games?
Talking, sharing, discussing, and even arguing 
contrasts with traditional classrooms where stu-
dents work in isolation on getting the one right an-
swer. Promoting mathematics as a collaborative and 
communicative enterprise challenges teachers to re-
think their ground rules for teaching mathematics.
Connection
Connecting mathematics asks students and teach-
ers to ﬁ nd mathematics in the real world, especially 
things related to students’ lives and interests, asso-
ciations among mathematical concepts, and ways 
that mathematics are related to other school sub-
jects and topics. “When am I ever going to use this?” 
is answered through activities and problems that 
connect mathematics to real problems that make 
sense to children.
School mathematics can be taught in connected 
ways or in disconnected ways. Disconnected math-
ematics is sometimes directed by textbooks and 
other materials. Connected mathematics is still fo-
cused on the development of concepts and skills 
but is open to many opportunities to build these 
skills through problem solving. The problems can 
be real, invented, based on classroom situations, 
drawn from other subjects, or generated by student 
interest. The lottery problem connected the interest 
of students to mathematical concepts of probability, 
data analysis, and number operations and to pro-
cesses of problem solving, reasoning, and commu-
nication. Many classroom situations illustrate con-
nections to children’s experiences.
•  A third-grade class sells pizzas at a Parents’ Night 
program. How much should the pizzas cost? How 
many pizzas will be needed? How many slices 
can be cut from one pizza? What is a fair price to 
charge for one slice? What is a reasonable proﬁ t?
•  A science unit on plant growth includes experi-
ments comparing growth under different light 
conditions. What measurements need to be 
made and how often? What units and measuring 
instruments are required? What is the best way to 
record observations? How should the results of 
the project be reported?
•  Ms. Wolfgang asks the students to use the news-
paper advertisements from the home improve-
ment store to determine how much it would cost 
to carpet a platform being built for a stage and 
reading area (Figure 2.11). The platform is 8 feet 
6 inches by 11 feet 9 inches, but the cost of carpet 
is given in dollars per square yard. One group of 
students decides to calculate the dimensions in 

22 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
feet and then in square feet, or approximately 
9 feet  12 feet  108 square feet, and then 
converts to square yards (108  9  12 square 
yards). Another group converts feet to yards and 
approximates with 3 yards  4 yards  12 square 
yards. If carpet is priced at $11.79 per square yard, 
they determine the cost as about $144, and then 
remembered the sales tax of 7.5% that must be 
added. They decided $150 was a good estimate 
of the total cost.
Solving the carpet problem requires measure-
ment, addition, division, multiplication, estimation, 
and percent. The diagram allows students to see 
how multiplication is used to solve area (3  4 
12 square yards) and ﬁnd the total cost (12 yards 
$12 per yard  $144). Students may also want to look 
at different ﬂ ooring materials related to economics 
topics in social studies.
Interdisciplinary teaching with integrated themes 
and activities (Table 2.3) builds children’s sense of 
how concepts in one subject link to concepts in 
mathematics.

Mathematical Representation
When adults recall their experiences with math-
ematics in school, they often only remember ﬁ ll-
ing out worksheets with numbers or writing on the 
board. Mathematical ideas can be expressed in 
many ways: physical models, pictures, diagrams, 
tables, graphs, charts, and a variety of symbols. The 
E
block tower problem was represented concretely 
with blocks, graphically in a table, and symbolically 
with formulas. The lottery problem was acted out 
through sampling, recorded in tables, and could be 
simulated with computer programs. “Half” is shown 
in pictures of areas and sets and symbolically as a 
common fraction, a decimal fraction, or a percent. 
Although “mean” and “median” are computed in spe-
ciﬁ c ways, students are sometimes confused by the 
differences. When means and medians for various 
data sets are displayed graphically, the differences 
may be more apparent. Using different representa-
tions contributes to the meaning and complexity of 
a concept.
Place value representation is a complex notion 
that children develop over several years. Children 
start with a naïve notion of one numeral or name 
for each amount. Two is one more than 1, 6 is one 
more than 5, 11 is one more than 10. The idea that 
numbers are just a never-ending sequence of words 
related by “plus 1” must change before students com-
pute with larger numbers. They need to see and know 
that the number system is based on groups of 10 and 
that number values can be represented in many 
ways. The number 16 can be shown by 16 blocks ar-
ranged in many ways, pictures of 16 objects, 1 rod 
and 6 cubes with place value blocks, a 4  4 grid,

 1, 10  6, 20  4, and XVI. Instead of being limited 
to one idea about 16 (Figure 2.12), children must un-
derstand that multiple representations are essential 
to developing a true understanding of number.
Integrating Process 
and Content Standards
Mathematics content and processes develop through 
many experiences with mathematics-rich activities 
and situations coupled with opportunities to com-
municate and connect those experiences. Effective 
teachers integrate content and process standards 
into every lesson and unit. In each of the vignettes 
and examples in this chapter, concepts and pro-
cesses have been highlighted. A unit on statistics has 
students measure and record their heights in inches 
(Figure 2.13a) and centimeters (Figure 2.13b). Then 
they organize the measurements for the class in a 
table (Figure 2.13c) and a graph (Figure 2.13d). In-
formation from the table and the graph describes 
the heights of children in the room and allows for 
conclusions about heights of the group.
•  “All the students are shorter than 70 inches (180 
centimeters) tall, and everybody is taller than 
45 inches (110 centimeters).”
•  “Most students are about 55 inches (140 centime-
ters) tall.”
•  “Most children are between 53 inches (130 centi-
meters) and 58 inches (145 centimeters) tall.”

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Students note extremes or limits, variation in heights, 
and a tendency of heights to cluster. These observa-
tions introduce statistical concepts of range, mean, 
median, and mode. The focus for this lesson is statis-
tical concept, skills, and language, but students also 
use knowledge of numbers and number operations, 
measurement, and algebraic thinking. Later in the 
year, an integrated unit in social studies and science 
on climate provides another chance to apply range, 
median, and mean to data on rain-
fall and temperature. Some teach-
ers fear that the greater emphasis 
on testing will limit their efforts to 
do exciting projects and stimulat-
ing teaching. In reality, instruction 
based on the NCTM principles and 
standards develops essential con-
cepts and skills in the curriculum 
and the demands for accountabil-
ity. When children learn important 
mathematics in meaningful ways, 
they learn the mathematics they 
need for their lives.
Many resources are available 
for teachers. NCTM provides publi-
cations and materials that support 
teachers’ efforts in implementing standards-based 
instruction. Membership in NCTM includes a sub-
scription to one of three journals. For elementary 
and early childhood teachers, Teaching Children 
Mathematics is recommended. Mathematics Teach-
ing in the Middle School is written for middle-grade 
teachers. The NCTM website http://www.nctm.org pro-
vides many helpful links for teachers, such as sam-
ple e-lessons, technology integration, and activities 
in the Illuminations website. NCTM also sponsors lo-
cal, state, regional, and national conferences each 
year with presentations and exhibits for teachers. 
Many other publishers and suppliers of mathematics 
teaching materials have coordinated their materials 
and publications with the standards.

Chapter 2 Deﬁ ning a Comprehensive Mathematics Curriculum

Working with teachers in your school or on your 
team helps you to focus on the needs of the chil-
dren in your room or grade level. Sharing ideas, 
articles, and materials with colleagues helps you to 
grow professionally. Many school districts employ a 
mathematics consultant or coordinator who knows 
about available resources. An experienced men-
tor also can help a new teacher ﬁ nd resources and 
learn how to use them.
Finding Focus
Teachers sometimes feel overwhelmed by national 
and state standards. In response to the concern that 
the curriculum was “a mile wide and an inch deep,” 
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in 
September 2006 published Curriculum Focal Points 
for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics 
that highlights three core ideas, called focal points,

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Summary
The worlds of 1910 and 2010 are different, and the math-
ematics that students need to live and thrive in the 21st 
century is different. A balanced program of number, ge-
ometry, algebra, measurement, and data analysis con-
cepts and skills replaces a mathematics program focused 
primarily on computation. Development of thinking skills 
and application of mathematics to solving problems 
breaks away from a focus on memorization. Understand-
ing what problems to solve and when and how to solve 
them is the center of the modern mathematics program.
NCTM recognizes the changing need of content and 
context for school mathematics in The Principles and 
Standards for School Mathematics (National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics, 2000). Five content standards 
and ﬁ ve process standards provide a coherent vision of 
mathematics to help students become productive and 
thinking citizens. Five major content topics are devel-
oped across all grade levels: numbers and operations, 
algebra, geometry, measurement, and data analysis and 
probability. Learning content occurs when students are 
communicating about mathematics, reasoning and solv-
ing problems, connecting mathematics to their world, 
and demonstrating their understanding in a variety of 
ways. The standards serve as a framework for state cur-
ricula in mathematics. They challenge teachers to focus 
on important mathematical content and skills that enable 
students to become proﬁ cient problem solvers.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Find the curriculum standards for your school or 
state on the Internet. Compare the NCTM content 
and process standards to your state or local math-
ematics curriculum. If you do not know the URL for 
your state’s department of education website, search 
for “mathematics standards state.” What similarities 
or differences do you ﬁ nd between the NCTM stan-
dards and your school or state’s standards?
 2.  Observe in a mathematics classroom, and de-
cide whether you see principles and standards in 
practice.
 3.  Describe an ideal classroom that would exemplify 
the principles and standards. What would you ex-
pect to see and hear in the classroom?
 4.  Look through a catalog of mathematics materials. 
Identify materials related to each of the content and 
process standards.
 5.  Go to http://www.nctm.org and read about the prin-
ciples and standards. Look at the resources avail-
able to teachers on this website.
 6.  Not all educators and parents agree with the NCTM 
standards. Conduct an Internet search for sites that 
raise objections to the standards. Do you agree or 
disagree with their arguments?

at each grade level. The principles and standards 
are still the framework for mathematics curriculum 
and instruction with problem solving as the central 
theme. The focal points listed in Table 2.4 identify 
three critical knowledge and skills at each grade 
level. The purpose was not to narrow the curricu-
lum to three concepts, but to help teachers organize 
instruction with attention to some essential develop-
mental knowledge.
The publication as well as the website www.nctm
.org describe ways teachers can utilize the focal 
points in planning and teaching. For example in 
grade 4, knowledge and skill with multidigit mul-
tiplication, area of two-dimensional shapes, and 
decimal fractions are emphasized. Students might 
cover boxes with centimeter grid paper and ﬁ nd 
connections among multiplication, area, and deci-
mal fractions.

Mathematics 
for Every Child
athematics knowledge and skill provide a key for entry into a 
rapidly changing technological world. In the middle of the 
last century the idea that only a few students, primarily 
white male students, could be successful in mathematics 
was widely accepted in American society. This perception 
denied female and minority students, students with spe-
cial needs, and students with linguistic differences access to advanced 
mathematics programs. As a result, females and minorities had fewer 
opportunities to learn and faced limited opportunities in college and 
vocational choices.
 
In 1998–1999, the NCTM Board of Directors renewed the challenge to 
schools and educators to provide equal opportunities (National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics, 2000, p. 13):
The Board of Directors sees the comprehensive mathematics 
education of every child as its most compelling goal. By “every 
child” we mean every child—no exceptions. We are particularly 
concerned about students who have been denied access in any 
way to educational opportunities for any reason, such as language, 
ethnicity, physical impairment, gender, socioeconomic status, and 
so on. We emphasize that “every child” includes
•  learners of English as a second language and speakers 
of English as a ﬁ rst language;
•  members of underrepresented ethnic groups and members 
of well-represented groups;
•  students who are physically challenged and those who are not;
•  females and males;

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Equity in Mathematics Learning
Whether teachers work in a self-contained setting 
or as specialists in mathematics, they have a profes-
sional responsibility to provide a mathematics-rich 
environment for all—boys and girls, students with 
limited English proﬁ ciency, members of all cultural 
and ethnic groups, students who are physically and 
learning challenged, students who are gifted and 
talented, and learners of every style and orienta-
tion. Meeting the needs of every student is not easy, 
but every teacher must work toward that goal. When 
students fail to develop their full potential in math-
ematics in elementary school, they have difﬁ culty 
with mathematics in later grades. Those in high 
school who lack the prerequisite understanding 
and skills for college and university study are unpre-
pared to enter many occupations. The social and 
economic implications for individuals and society 
as a whole are great when students are not nurtured 
in mathematics.
In this chapter we con -
sider equity in mathe-
matics learning from sev-
eral viewpoints: gender, 
ethnicity, limited English 
proﬁ ciency, 
technologi-
cal equity, special needs, 
giftedness, and learning 
styles. Each of these groups presents its own chal-
lenges for the classroom teacher, challenges that 
must be met to ensure that every child in each of 
these groups is able to learn interesting and valu-
able mathematics.
•  students who live in poverty and those who do not;
•  students who have not been successful and those who have been
successful in school and in mathematics.
The Board of Directors commits the organization and every group 
effort within the organization to this goal.
In a recent position statement (2005) NCTM restates and extends 
this commitment and challenge (http://www.nctm.org
(
):
Every student should have equitable and optimal opportunities to learn
mathematics free from bias—intentional or unintentional—based on
race, gender, socioeconomic status, or language. In order to close the
achievement gap, all students need the opportunity to learn challenging 
mathematics from a well-qualiﬁ ed teacher who will make connections 
to the background, needs, and cultures of all learners.
In this chapter you will read about:
 Ways to include diverse cultural aspects in mathematics teaching
 The role of ethnomathematics in teaching mathematics
 Strategies for teaching mathematics to English-language learners
 Teaching strategies for students with learning disabilities

mathematics

Chapter 3 Mathematics for Every Child 
29
Gender
Only a few decades ago one of the truisms in educa-
tion was “Math is for boys, English is for girls.” Not 
that girls didn’t achieve in mathematics—some did. 
But the expectation was that boys should do well 
in mathematics. Test scores in high school and col-
lege enrollment ﬁ gures supported the truism. In the 
minds of many, mathematics was the domain of 
men, not women.
In recent years evidence put this “truism” to rest 
forever. Girls can do mathematics as well as boys, 
and recent test scores support that stand. The most 
recent test results of the National Assessment of Ed-
ucational Progress (2005) show only a slight differ-
ence in mathematics scores between boys and girls 
(girls’ score, 278; boys’ score, 280). The difference 
between the genders has remained about the same 
over the past decade, and scores for both have con-
tinued to rise. Thus, as a percent of the mean test 
score for boys and girls, the difference between the 
genders continues to shrink, to the point that any dif-
ferences are now statistically insigniﬁ cant. A meta-
analysis of recent mathematics scores on the SAT 
shows no difference in girls’ and boys’ scores (Bar-
nette & Rivers, 2004). Girl’s enrollment in mathemat-
ics courses in high school and college continues to 
rise but still trails boys’ enrollment ﬁ gures.
Although the facts show no gender differences 
in mathematics achievement, there are still reports 
of girls being treated differently from boys in math-
ematics classes in subtle ways. In the past teachers 
at all levels devoted more classroom time to helping 
boys. Boys were encouraged more than girls to think 
through a problem, as opposed to being given direct 
cues or directions for solving it. Teachers tended to 
call on boys more than girls during class discus-
sions, and boys were praised more frequently than 
girls (Huber & Scanlon, 1995; Sadker & Sadker, 1994; 
Tapasak, 1990). Although today’s classrooms show 
less of this gender distinction, there is still work to 
be done. Even parents’ attitudes reﬂ ect this distinc-
tion in mathematics. Parents tend to attribute their 
girls’ mathematics achievement to hard work, but 
the boys’ achievement is attributed to natural talent 
(Gershaw, 2006; McCookLast, 2005).
Children learn that being a boy or a girl 
makes a difference in what they are ex-
pected to be, do, think, and feel. This learn-
ing process is called gender socialization. 
Differences in treatment and expectations 
. . . inﬂ uence the kinds of skills each sex de-
velops, how conﬁ dent children feel as learn-
ers, and even what intellectual risks they are 
willing to take. . . . Girls learn to approach 
math and science with greater uncertainty 
and ambivalence than boys, with inadequate 
practice and uncertainty in particular skill 
areas (like spatial skills) and, more generally, 
with conﬂ icts about competence and inde-
pendence. (Davenport, 1994, pp. 1–2)
Even when teachers treat students equally, de-
rogatory remarks from male students about female 
students’ capabilities and interests in mathematics 
have negative effects on females. Female students 
may downplay their interest and skills when they 
reach middle school because of beliefs that females 
are not or should not be as good in mathematics 
as males. Gallagher and Kaufman and Campbell 
provide a fuller discussion of causes and effects of 
gender differences in mathematics (see Gallagher & 
Kaufman, 2004; Campbell, 1995).
Even though these societal attitudes ﬂ y in the 
face of facts and educational policies, they do have 
an effect on young women. Fewer girls enroll in up-
per-level mathematics courses in high school or 
become mathematics majors in college. One study 
found that 9% of girls in grade 4 expressed a dis-
like for mathematics. By grade 12 the percentage 
had risen to 50% (Chacon & Soto-Johnson, 2003). 
A long-term study followed students from middle 
school through high school for a period of 17 years. 
The ﬁ ndings showed that although girls had higher 
grades, they had a lower interest in math than boys 
at every grade level and their interest in math de-
clined every year from grade 7 through high school 
(Steeh, 2002). Clearly much more must be done to 
ensure that our young women remain conﬁ dent 
in their mathematics ability and that they develop 
and maintain a desire to pursue more advanced 
mathematics.
There are always going to be differences between 
the genders in classrooms. Training little boys to be 
more like girls in their decorum or little girls to imi-
tate boys in their energy level is counterproductive. 
Both genders beneﬁ t the classroom. It is important 

30 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
to recognize those bene-
ﬁ ts and to help all students 
gain from them.
One stereotypical dif-
ference between boys and 
girls that can beneﬁ t boys 
in mathematics is boys’ 
risk-taking tendency. A 
stereotypical elementary 
school classroom can ﬁ nd 
boys out of their seats, nois-
ily interacting with others, 
and taking and issuing dares to each other. Most of 
the girls are composed, on task, and following the 
teacher’s directions. When these behaviors are ex-
tended to mathematics, they can work to the boys’ 
beneﬁ t. Consider the approach to nonroutine prob-
lems that each type of student will take. Students 
who have practiced only the routine algorithms (a 
set of instructions used to solve a problem, such as 
the procedure for long division) and solution strat-
egies presented by the teacher in class may ﬁ nd 
that such routine approaches are not helpful with 
nonroutine problems. Risk-takers who have tried 
alternative approaches, used guessing, and created 
their own solution strategies are in a position to try 
something different and so are not intimidated by a 
problem that is unfamiliar and cannot be solved by 
the routine algorithms learned in class. A teacher 
who is alert to such stereotypical tendencies will 
help girls confront and solve nonroutine problems. 
At the same time the teacher will assist the boys to 
master classroom procedures and strategies when 
they are explored.
Research suggests that gender affects spatial 
sense. The ability to view objects, mentally ma-
nipulate them, and move between two and three 
dimensions is related to gender. Among children, 
only 17% of girls achieved the average score that 
boys did on tests of spatial sense (Linn & Petersen, 
1986). Further research has supported this gender 
factor in spatial sense (Greenes & Tsankova, 2004; 
Levine et al., 1999). If no intervention is done, then 
the gap in spatial sense becomes larger as children 
move from grade to grade, until the difference be-
gins to affect other areas of mathematics learning. 
The solution is simply to teach spatial sense in the el-
ementary classroom along with other mathematics 
topics. When students (regardless of gender) who 
have a poorly developed spatial sense are given the 
opportunity to improve and extend that ability, they 
quickly erase any deﬁ cit within a few grades. Thus 
the single-gender difference in mathematics may be 
overcome with a focused effort in the primary and 
elementary classrooms. See Chapter 17 for activities 
that develop spatial sense.
In closing, gender is no barrier to achievement 
in mathematics. Girls and boys bring various talents 
and abilities to their mathematics, which serve to 
enrich a mathematics classroom. At one time math-
ematics may have been only for boys, but not any-
more. More than ever, mathematics belongs to ev-
eryone, and the role of the classroom teacher is to 
ensure that both girls and boys believe and achieve 
in mathematics.
Ethnic and Cultural Differences
Students from ethnic or cultural groups different 
from the dominant culture may encounter inequita-
ble treatment. According to Secada (1991), a math-
ematics curriculum that fails to reﬂ ect the lives of 
children from culturally different groups may stereo-
type mathematics as belonging to a few privileged 
groups. In addition, in the United States expectations 
for achievement in mathematics are sometimes not 
as high for these students as for Asians and white 
students. Gloria Ladson-Billings (1995, p. 38) illus-
trates this difference:
White, middle-class students are treated as 
if they already have knowledge, and experi-
ence instruction as apprenticeship. However, 
African American students often are treated 
as if they have no knowledge and experi-
ence instruction as teaching.
When students are apprenticed, they are 
afforded the opportunity to perform tasks 
that they have not fully learned. . . . In the 
classroom, this apprenticing is played out by 
teachers treating white, middle-class stu-
dents as if they are competent in areas they 
are not. They are treated as if they come 
with knowledge (which they do).
However, African American young-
sters often are treated as if they have no 
knowledge.
Thus, as “empty vessels” they must be 
ﬁ lled.

 
Chapter 3 Mathematics for Every Child 
31
Ladson-Billings noted that African American stu-
dents received more teacher-directed lessons in 
speciﬁ c knowledge and skills and fewer opportuni-
ties to engage in problem-solving situations that re-
quired independent thought and action.
No evidence supports 
any claim that African 
American, Latino Ameri-
can, 
Native 
American, 
Asian American, or any 
other group of students 
lacks the ability to learn 
mathematics. 
What 
is 
lacking in many instances 
is a common background for learning mathemat-
ics. Many students live in socioeconomic environ-
ments that offer different background-building ex-
periences. Ladson-Billings (1995) cites a speciﬁ c 
example of how socioeconomic circumstances in-
ﬂ uence students’ thinking: A problem asks, “Which 
is a more economical way to commute to work, a 
bus pass that costs $65 a month or a one-way fare 
for $1.50?” The answer depends on experience. One 
student might consider one-way fares better be-
cause a parent’s transportation cost would be $60 
when commuting to a single job for 20 workdays 
each month. Other students could view the pass as 
less costly than individual fares, if a monthly pass 
would allow for unlimited trips between home, em-
ployment, shopping, and other important sites. So-
cioeconomic conditions and a narrow range of ex-
periences may impede early learning, but they are 
not reasons for believing that students are less able 
to learn mathematics and should aim for less lofty 
goals than other students. In keeping with the key 
point for teaching diverse students, it is important 
to provide all children with a fair and equitable op-
portunity to learn mathematics.
Multiculturalism
When students are from different cultural or eth -
nic backgrounds, introducing multicultural aspects 
into the mathematics classroom can be construc-
tive. Multiculturalism in mathematics suggests using 
materials from many cultures to explain mathemat-
ics concepts, to apply mathematical ideas, and to 
provide a context for mathematics problems. Thus 
there is more to multiculturalism than hanging post-
ers on the wall or focusing on a few special holidays. 
Grounding mathematics in meaningful contexts 
for children is crucial; otherwise mathematics be-
comes a dance of symbols and abstract numerical 
relationships.
Putting 
mathematics 
in meaningful settings in-
volves more than chang-
ing the names of people 
in word problems to re -
ﬂ ect different ethnic back-
grounds. It involves prob-
lems in real-life settings 
that children from differ-
ent ethnic backgrounds 
will ﬁ nd compelling. Chil-
dren can be a source of multicultural mathematics 
material. A teacher who knows the children in the 
classroom and their backgrounds can place math-
ematics in meaningful contexts for them. When 
mathematics is couched in signiﬁ cant situations for 
children, they begin to understand that mathemat-
ics is a valuable subject, one that has real worth 
in their personal lives, as reﬂ ected in their ethnic 
background. Generic settings that can appeal to 
children from various ethnic backgrounds include 
native cooking and recipes, crafts involving mea-
surement and geometry, designing and building a 
house, shopping for native foods and goods. Read-
ing multicultural stories with mathematics themes is 
an effective way to fold multiculturalism into math-
ematics class. Table 3.1 is a list of some multicultural 
storybooks with mathematics themes to them.
Storytelling can also feature multicultural 
themes. An effective storyteller can be more engag-
ing than a story in a book. These stories or folktales 
can come from a variety of sources, including the 
students themselves (see Goral & Gnadinger, 2006). 
An advantage of storytelling is that the teacher can 
adjust the story to emphasize a particular point or 
mathematics concept. In addition to stories, songs 
that feature mathematical concepts or numbers 
may also be part of mathematics class. The list in 
Table 3.2 is adapted from Galda and Cullinan (2006). 
It contains songs and folktales that feature a speciﬁ c 
number.
Ethnomathematics
In 1985, Uribitan D’Ambrosio introduced the term 
ethnomathematics. He used it to refer to mathemat-

32 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
ics as seen through a cultural ﬁ lter. Ethnomath-
ematics is the “study of the interaction between 
mathematics and human culture” (Johnson, 2006). 
All mathematics developed from a cultural need, 
regardless of the historical setting. Geometry con-
cepts grew out of a need to measure land, build 
dwellings, and ﬁ nd one’s way between villages and 
cities. The rise of commerce set in motion the de-
velopment of accounting and the algorithms we use 
today. Consequently, ethnomathematics reﬂ ects 
situations that led to the development of mathemat-
ics in various cultures. Ethnomathematics informs 
teachers and students about how mathematics was 
developed in response to societal needs, and it is 
shaped by cultural settings and issues today. Thus 
ethnomathematics delves more deeply into the in-
terplay between mathematics and culture than does 
multiculturalism.
Every culture developed mathematics to ﬁ t a 
particular need. Children illuminate these develop-
ments by asking their parents how they used math-
ematics in their native land, under what situations 
they learned to use mathematics, and how they use 
mathematics in their everyday lives. Rather than 
sanitize mathematics from all cultural inﬂ uences, 
mathematics becomes the shaper and tool of all 
civilizations. Minority students are encouraged 
by and involved in mathematics that is intimately 
connected to their cultural background. Table 3.3 
presents 10 ways of including culturally relevant ac-
tivities in the classroom. These topics and related 
projects can motivate students from diverse ethnic 
backgrounds to learn mathematics.
Multicultural themes should be integrated into 
the mathematics curriculum. They could be the 
settings that introduce mathematics concepts, il-
luminate those concepts, or summarize the study 
of a particular concept. Multiculturalism is not an

TABLE 3.3 • Activities That Draw on the Cultural and Ethnic Background of Children
1. History of Mathematics
Biographies and anecdotes about Chinese, Hindu, and Persian mathematicians can be sources of interesting, humanizing 
stories for children. Teachers can relate these stories to students at appropriate times during mathematics class. Children 
could also act out the stories, playing the roles of mathematician and others in these minidramas (see Johnson, 1991, 1999).
2. Number Systems
Studying the numerical systems of the Egyptians, Native Americans, or the Maya is broadening for all children. Children can 
make posters describing the other systems. They can also change the prices on price tags or in circulars to show prices in 
other numerical systems.
3. Counting Language
Learning to count in the language of another student can be a means of introducing multiculturalism into the classroom. 
Many languages have a counting system that is much more logical than ours. In many languages, 11 is expressed as “ten-
one,” 12 is “ten-two,” up to 19, “ten-nine”; 21 is “two-ten-one,” 22 is “two-ten-two,” 31 is “three-ten-one,” and so forth. 
Children can teach the class to count in their native language. They could also show their counting words in a visual exhibit 
such as a poster or table display.
4. Algorithms
The algorithms we use for computation may be different in another culture. Ask children to share their algorithms. Russian 
peasant multiplication or lattice multiplication are interesting and effective alternatives to algorithms commonly used in the 
United States. Students can explain the algorithms that they or their parents use that are alternative algorithms to the ones 
studied in class. A homework assignment might be to compute using an alternative algorithm.
5. Problem Contexts
Teachers might provide contexts for story problems that are drawn from settings and activities familiar to other cultures. 
Students can write out meaningful contexts or problems to use in class.
6. Multicultural Literature
Folktales or foreign literature may be used to teach mathematics in context. Children can ask parents and relatives to relate 
these tales to them. The children can then bring the tales to class.
7. Art
Symmetry patterns or artworks from different cultures may be used to promote geometric understandings. Navajo basket 
designs, African mandalas, or Asian needlepoint designs are full of symmetry and geometric ﬁ gures. Some students may 
have native artwork at home that they can bring to class. Children can produce artwork that resembles the native art. Chil-
dren can also cut out examples of native art in magazines and assemble collages to represent the native artwork.
8. Recreational Mathematics
Games such as Pente, GO!, Sudoku, or Mancala involve strategies that promote logical thinking. One station of an activity 
center can be stocked with these different games.
9. Calendars
Calendars from different cultures include different names for months, days of the week, and frequently different ways of 
recording the date. Foreign names might be included in the daily calendar reading. Several foreign language calendars could 
be displayed around the classroom, and different students assigned to read the date each day.
10. Notation
It can be beneﬁ cial to have children show and explain their different notations for familiar representations. For example, 
some Latin American children will correctly write AB∠C for ∠ABC or QR

S for QRS. Children can share the notation they 
learned in their native land at appropriate times during mathematics class. Groups of students could design posters to show 
the notations that other cultures use.

add-on to supplement the study of mathematics. It is 
the vehicle for the very study of mathematics.
Every 
mathematics 
classroom has its own cul-
ture, either one that recog-
nizes and prizes the vari-
ous ethnic backgrounds 
of its students or one that 
ignores all cultural back-
grounds and sets mathematics in a culturally neutral 
context. To best encourage ethnically diverse stu-
dents, the teacher must acknowledge their cultural 
and ethnic backgrounds and use those backgrounds 
to enliven and enhance their study of mathematics.
Mathematics may be the ﬁ rst subject area that 
culturally diverse students begin to learn, but teach-
ers cannot assume that students with computational 
proﬁ ciency understand number and operational 
concepts. Certainly, many children from all cultural 
backgrounds have learned pencil-and-paper com-
putations. However, focusing exclusively on compu-
tations deprives the student of language and con-
cept development needed for problem solving and 
reasoning. Problem solving, best done in the con-
text of real-world story problems, should be based 
on children’s experiences. Zanger (1998) reports a 
classroom project of collecting and publishing math 
problems written by students and parents. At ﬁ rst 
the parents were wary, but when the book was pub-
lished, it became an immediate hit with students, 
who now had problems related to their experiences. 
Students unable to express themselves fully in Eng-
lish might write out problems in their ﬁ rst language 
accompanied by graphic depictions. These prob-
lems can then be translated by another student or 
faculty member. When the teacher writes real-world 
problems, the problems should be concise, clear, 
and free of slang or unfamiliar idioms.
Many school districts provide professional devel-
opment for teachers who work with cultural, ethnic, 
and language diversity. A new teacher should take 
advantage of these professional opportunities. Un-
derstanding the principles of good mathematics is a 
foundation, but additional preparation provides the 
background to become more sensitive to the spe-
ciﬁ c cultural and ethnic groups in the local district 
and to become familiar with programs for language 
learners offered in and beyond the classroom.
Students Who Have Limited 
English Proﬁ ciency
The United States has a well-deserved reputation as 
a melting pot of races, cultures, and nationalities. 
In the nation’s classrooms nearly 6 million students 
have limited English proﬁ ciency (LEP). By some es-
timates, within 20 years most students in American 
schools will not speak English as a ﬁ rst language. As 
the number of such students has grown, educational 
policies for these students have changed. More and 
more states are eliminating bilingual or foreign lan-
guage classrooms in favor of schooling LEP students 
in regular English-speaking classrooms. The result is 
that more and more teachers will have LEP students 
in class.
The ﬁ rst language of 
LEP students is intimately 
tied to their cultural or 
ethnic background. It is 
the language spoken at 
home and in their social 
community, and it is the 
means by which LEP stu-
dents communicate with 
family, peers, and neigh-
bors about their neighbor-
hood and community, all 
of which are immersed in 
their native culture. Many 
LEP students might speak 
English only at school.
LEP students learn English over several years. 
Table 3.4, adapted from the Virginia State Board 
of Education, gives some sense of how long it can 
take for LEP students to communicate effectively in 
English.
The timeline in Table 3.4 assumes continuous liv-
ing in the United States. Many LEP children return to 
their native lands every year, sometimes for weeks 
at a time. During their visit they will rarely speak 
or hear English, and so such visits may delay the 
development suggested in the table. With Table 3.4 
as a guide, teachers can begin to understand why 
a child who can carry on a perfectly good English 
conversation in the playground can rightly claim he 
cannot understand the English discussions in the 
classroom. By some estimates, instructional class-

 
Chapter 3 Mathematics for Every Child 
35
room English lags behind conversational English by 
up to 5 years. An added factor is that mathematics 
has its own language, which is quite different from 
conversational English. Words and terms that chil-
dren hear only in a mathematics class include de-
nominator, numerator, quotient, isosceles, greatest 
common factor, and composite, to name a few. As 
a consequence, mathematics English is even more 
challenging than general classroom English.
A number of teaching strategies can help LEP 
students in the classroom. For example, speaking 
slowly and clearly and carefully pronouncing each 
word is helpful to LEP students. In spoken and written 
speech teachers should avoid slang, colloquialisms, 
and other unusual linguistic expressions, including 
contractions. It can be beneﬁ cial to LEP students 
to use familiar phrases and vocabulary, especially 
when introducing new concepts. That way they are 
able to focus on the mathematics involved and not 
have to wrestle with the English content. Sometimes 
a simple alteration in speech patterns can be advan-
tageous. Instead of using pronouns, teachers can 
use full referents. Not “What is its area?” but “What 
is the circle’s area?” Do not expect LEP students to 
copy material from the board or overhead screen. 
Instead, prepare a handout for them (actually for the 
whole class) so they can focus on discussions and 
explanations and not on the task of accurate copy-
ing. In a similar light, when writing on the board, 
print rather than use cursive.
Extralinguistic clues are particularly helpful to 
LEP students. Appropriate gestures, facial expres-
sions, examples and nonexamples, and models or 
manipulatives can illuminate a discussion that might 
otherwise be unintelligible to LEP students. When 
introducing new terms or vocabulary, teachers can 
write these on the board beforehand and point to 
the speciﬁ c word as it is being discussed, along with 
some model or action to clarify its meaning, such as 
pointing to a picture of a rectangle when that term 
is used.
A well-meaning teacher may use childish vocab-
ulary and an extremely slow pace in conversations 
directed to LEP students. LEP students can perceive 
these childish speech patterns and may react nega-
tively to them. Avoid speaking louder than normal 
to LEP students, as some people do when assist-
ing a foreign tourist with directions. LEP students

can sense this and may react against it. If a teacher 
makes any of these errors, recognizing the error and 
correcting it is the key.
Grouping is another way to support learning En-
glish. English learners can work in small groups to 
solve story problems or open-ended problems. An 
all-English-learning group allows children to com-
municate freely with one another about the problem 
and its potential solutions. At other times, English 
learners might be grouped with English speakers 
who can model procedures and behaviors appropri-
ate for the mathematics classroom. English learners 
can also be grouped with bilingual children. Such 
a grouping validates their culture and supports the 
maintenance of their ﬁ rst language while learn-
ing mathematics. As language learners gain con-
ﬁ dence, they may make an oral presentation to a 
small group, where they can make use of gestures, 
intonations, and visual aids.
Another aspect of teaching mathematics to LEP 
students involves the mathematics itself, the words 
and symbols of mathematics. There are many terms 
in mathematics that have entirely different mean-
ings in conversational English. A list of these words 
includes:
 
Right 
Volume 
Left
 
Square 
Face 
Variable
 
Mode 
Median 
Round
Native English speakers can tell from the context 
which meaning of the term is suggested, but not LEP 
students. They need time to develop the ability to 
discern what meaning such words convey.
Consider mathematics homophones, such as 
one/won, whole/hole, cent/scent, and arc/ark. Even 
a native English-speaking child needs assistance 
to discern the correct word and meaning. LEP stu-
dents require more time and experience before they 
can do so. Then there are soundalike words that are 
difﬁ cult for LEP students to distinguish: line/lion, 
three/tree, leave/leaf, graph/graft, four/fourth, and 
angle/angel. In all these cases the teacher who pays 
careful attention to the mathematics vocabulary 
seeks to clarify any confusion before it becomes 
problematic.
Another aspect of mathematics to consider is 
the symbols of its language. Many symbols are not 
as universally used and accepted as we might ex -
pect. For example, the 
number 3.14 is written 3,14 
by some cultures, whereas 
the number 3,452 is writ-
ten 3.453. We write $1 but 
read this as “one dollar,” 
with the leading symbol 
($) read last. However, 
we read 5¢, 3, 4 lbs, and 
6 yds from left to right, as 
the symbols appear. Some LEP students read right to 
left, so the number 86 means “sixty-eight” to them.
A simple expression such as 8  2 is read several 
different ways in English:
8 divided by 2
2 goes into 8
2 divided into 8
8 divided in half
Consider how confusing this simple expression and 
others can be to LEP students. Becoming aware of 
the subtle aspects of language is an important ﬁ rst 
step for teachers to help LEP and other students be-
come successful in mathematics.

Give four English expressions that are equivalent to 
the mathematics expression 7  2. •••
Assessing LEP students in mathematics can be 
challenging. Is the difﬁ culty with a mathematics 
concept or a homework problem due to a language 
issue or the mathematics involved? At times LEP 
children might frame an explanation in their native 
language. Another child or a teacher might then 
translate the answer. This enables the child to com-
municate without the burden of trying to write in a 
new language, and the teacher has a more accurate 
understanding of the child’s progress.
Many LEP students learn different algorithms 
for the four basic operations in their native lands. 
It may be more advantageous to allow LEP students 
to continue to use the algorithms they have already 
learned rather than insist that they adopt the famil-
iar algorithms we use in the United States. Allow-
ing LEP students to use their native algorithms also 
E

validates the students’ cultural background, as sug-
gested in the section on multiculturalism. For exam-
ple, students from some Latino cultures will perform 
two-digit subtraction as shown here.

This algorithm avoids regrouping. Instead, 10 units 
are added to the units of the larger number, and one 
10 is added to the tens digit of the smaller number. 
Because both numbers were increased by 10, the 
difference between the resulting values is the same 
as it was for the original values.
It is important to remember that LEP students 
may be further advanced in their mathematics than 
the rest of the students in the class. They simply 
need to develop a command of English that will en-
able them to contribute to the class and progress in 
their mathematical knowledge. With your help they 
can succeed.
Technological Equity
Technological advances have changed the land-
scape of mathematics education. Calculators, com-
puter software, and the Internet have had profound 
effects on the teaching and learning of mathemat-
ics. These new and emerging technologies will have 
a yet undetermined effect on mathematics teaching 
and learning. We advocate taking appropriate ad-
vantage of existing technologies to improve math-
ematics learning.
The positive effects of technology must be 
viewed through the lens of equity. Not all students 
have the same access to the technologies we discuss 
throughout the text. Many schools provide calcula-
tors and software programs. The question of equity 
arises with access to the Internet. Many students 
can use a computer at home to explore the Internet 
and to try some of the interactive lessons in later 
chapters. However, Internet access is not univer-
sal. According to a recent Education Week survey, 
about 1 in 5 students does not have a computer at 
home (Education Week, 2006). Not all children with 
a computer at home have Internet access. For some 
children with Internet access, one or both parents 
may work from home and cannot give up valuable 
computer time. Teachers may interview students to 
assess their home computer situation. See Chapter 
6 for information about how useful the computer, 
calculator, and the Internet are for helping children 
learn mathematics.
What about children who do not have any Inter-
net access at home? What can be done to ensure 
that all children have appropriate opportunities to 
use the Internet? A teacher can arrange for students 
to use the classroom or school library computers 
during the school day or before or after school or a 
computer in the public library. Children once went 
to the library to use the encyclopedias and other 
reference texts. Library opportunities for children, 
however, must be carefully considered. To require 
a child to visit a public library several times a week 
seems unfair when others in the class can use a 
computer at home. Even one public library visit in 
a two-week period may be burdensome because of 
location or transportation. Teachers can get all the 
facts involving their students before deciding what 
is reasonable for out-of-school computer use. The 
central tenet is that all students should have equi-
table and appropriate opportunities to succeed in 
mathematics.
Students Who Have Difﬁ culty 
Learning Mathematics
Difﬁ culty learning mathematics denotes a wide 
range of impediments that students must deal with. 
One child may have a disability in reading, whereas 
another may have difﬁ culty in mathematics; one 
child with disabilities may be hyperactive, whereas 
another may be quiet and withdrawn. Difﬁ culty 
learning mathematics can stem from a variety of 
sources, including emotional, learning, and cogni-
tive disabilities. In other words, children with learn-
ing disabilities are a heterogeneous group (Mercer, 
1992, p. 25).
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA), a federal law, requires that children with 
disabilities have free public education in the “least 
restricted environment.” Rather than being placed 
in isolated special education settings, more and 
more students with disabilities are being included in 
the regular classroom, sometimes with instructional 

38 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
support from aides or special education teachers. 
Inclusion means that teachers work with students 
with a variety of cognitive abilities, learning styles, 
social problems, and physical challenges. The chal-
lenge is to ﬁ nd strategies that maximize learning for 
all learners.
The learning expecta-
tions and nature of the in-
structional support for stu-
dents with special needs 
is outlined in an individu-
alized educational plan, 
commonly referred to as 
IEP. Based on individual-
ized goals, the teacher 
may modify instructional 
techniques and assign-
ments as described in the 
plan. Growing evidence 
shows that active engagement of students is as 
beneﬁ cial for students with learning disabilities as 
for those without diagnosed disabilities. Table 3.5 
outlines types of problems associated with students 
who have learning disabilities.
For many children with special needs, especially 
those with learning and cognitive disabilities, their 
difﬁ culty comes from the fact that their processing 
time is slower than that of regular children. They 
may require more time to understand a mathematics 
concept, apply it, and make it theirs. One approach 
to help children access new mathematics might be 
termed overlearning. Overlearning involves learn -
ing, practicing, and drilling the same math fact, 
procedure, or algorithm many times to achieve the 
ability to use it without prompting. For example, 
all children practice the algorithm for multiplica-
tion with whole numbers, so they learn it and can 
develop the habit of using it automatically, without 
having to think through each step of the algorithm 
every time they use it. Alternative algorithms, dis-
cussed in Chapter 12, may be less confusing for 
many students who struggle with traditional algo-
rithms. Students with special needs will require 
more time with such an algorithm, careful and re-
peated modeling of the algorithm by their teacher, 
and many repeated practice sessions to achieve a 
measure of mastery. However, it is not necessary to 
insist on mastery of math facts or a particular algo-
rithm before children with leaning disabilities can 
move forward with their mathematics learning.
Students with disabili-
ties can also beneﬁ t from 
math cards. Students write 
their own math facts on 
an index card, or they 
write information to help 
them with a mathematical 
concept or process. For 
example, the math card shown on page 39 was used 
by a child with special needs to help him recall the 
steps in the long division algorithm. He had previ-
ously engaged in developmental activities to build 
his understanding of division but needed help to 
complete the steps in the division algorithm.

These math cards and similar learning aids 
should be available to students whenever they need 
them. Sometimes children outgrow them and do 
not require the prompts the cards provide. In other 
cases the cards continue to serve as a security blan-
ket, a quick reminder to students of what they have 
already mastered. Still other children will require 
the math cards for all their academic lives and may 
use similar cards for life outside the classroom.
Many students with special needs have difﬁ culty 
with their visual perception. The page of a standard 
mathematics textbook might be an overwhelming 
swirl of colors, pictures, and symbols. Students 
might cover up the nonessential part of a page when 
solving a problem from their book. They might use 
a piece of cardboard with a rectangular opening 
cut in it. The opening could be shifted around the 
page to reveal a problem, diagram, or example. 
Children with visual difﬁ culties or trouble with ﬁ ne 
motor skills will ﬁ nd some of the algorithms difﬁ cult 
because of the requirement of precise placement 
of digits as they use the algorithm. The algorithm

vide a grid for them to use, as

needs children. These sites contain lesson plans or

Gifted and Talented Students
Why are students who are gifted and talented in-
cluded in a chapter on equity in mathematics? After 
all, if these students are gifted, do they really need 
any assistance to achieve? The point here is not to 
help gifted and talented students meet a speciﬁ c 
achievement level that is established for all students. 
Rather, the point is to meet their speciﬁ c needs. All 
children, including gifted and talented children, de-
serve a challenging mathematics curriculum, one 
that will advance their knowledge of mathematics 
at a pace that will continue to motivate them. In ad-
dition, many gifted and talented students are at risk. 
Surprisingly, the dropout rate for gifted and talented 
students (about 20%) nearly matched the dropout 
rate of the general student population (about 25%) 
in several studies (Ruf, 2006; Renzulli & Park, 2002; 
Schneider, 1998). Thus gifted and talented students 
deserve a place in a chapter on equity.
At one time, intelligence test scores were used as 
the sole determiner of gifted and talented students; 
today, identiﬁ cation is based on multiple criteria. 
Laurence Ridge and Joseph Renzulli (1981) identi-
ﬁ ed three clusters of traits: above-average general 
ability, task commitment, and creativity. Table 3.6 
lists the characteristics of each cluster. Test scores, 
teacher observations, and work samples are often 
used to evaluate these characteristics. In the past, 
qualiﬁ ed gifted students were eligible for various 
services, ranging from special programs and activi-
ties during the school day to enrichment classes and 
extracurricular programs.
The federal No Child Left Behind Act has had 
some unexpected consequences for gifted and tal-
ented education. The act focuses attention on under-
achieving groups, seeking to raise their mathemat-
ics performance, but it ignores gifted and talented 
students. As of 2004, 22 states did not contribute any 
funds to gifted and talented programs, and 5 oth-
ers earmarked only $250,000 to support gifted and 
talented education. At present, only 2 cents of every 
$100 in federal funds for education is dedicated to 
gifted and talented learning (Bilger, 2004). An ex-
ample of how gifted and talented funding is drying 
up can be found in Illinois. In 2002, Illinois provided 
$19 million for gifted and talented programs. In 
2004, all gifted and talented funding was eliminated 
(Shermo, 2004).
Gifted students are far more likely to be in a reg-
ular classroom for the entire school day. Although 
gifted students will be able to achieve basic mathe-
matics without any special attention, these students 
who are gifted in mathematics deserve as much at-
tention to their needs as any other group of students 
to meet their full potential in mathematics.
In addition to the characteristics listed in Table 
3.6, classroom teachers should also recognize other 
pertinent characteristics of gifted students in math-
ematics. Gifted students may immerse themselves in 
one or two mathematics topics intensely for a period 
of time. They often have original ways of thinking 
7 8
 5 2

 
Chapter 3 Mathematics for Every Child 
41
and a willingness to try different approaches and in-
ventive problem solutions. Despite the stereotype of 
gifted children as ideal students, they are individu-
als with the full range of behaviors, including be-
ing stubborn, messy, forgetful, or rebellious. Traits 
of gifted students—such as questioning authority, 
extreme imagination, and absolute focus on one 
topic—often dismay teachers but may be signs of 
boredom and a need for additional responsibility 
and challenge.
Gifted students do not learn concepts and skills 
automatically; they need to participate in a planned, 
systematic mathematics program in which they 
learn basic mathematical concepts, develop rea-
sonable proﬁ ciency with basic facts and algorithms 
and other skills, and apply their knowledge to solv-
ing problems. However, gifted students may learn 
at a rapid pace and need additional opportunities 
beyond the basic curriculum.
To challenge and provide quality mathematics 
to gifted and talented students, teachers need to 
identify gifted and talented students in the class. 
Test scores and grades might assist in identifying 
these students, but they are not the only identifying 
characteristics. Additional characteristics, listed in 
Table 3.7, were developed by Russian educator Igor 
Krutetskii, who found that gifted and talented stu-
dents in mathematics exhibited a number of these 
characteristics to a high degree.
After identifying potential gifted and talented stu-
dents in mathematics, what helps them reach their 
full potential? In a word, challenge. If gifted children 
are not challenged by the curriculum early in their 
school years, they will equate smart with easy. As a 
result, challenges and hard work will feel threatening 
to their self-esteem. Many gifted children sit through 
lessons that they fully understand and could easily 
teach to the rest of the class.

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Challenges for gifted students can take many 
forms. A well-meaning teacher might provide extra 
problems to keep a gifted student on task, but this 
serves only to punish students who complete an as-
signment quickly. In this case gifted and talented 
children quickly learn that their hard work results 
only in more work to do. Instead of assigning more 
of the same types of problem, challenge problems 
such as brainteasers might be used to spark atten-
tion and motivate gifted students to move beyond 
the typical problems at hand. In many cases gifted 
students could prepare a presentation to the class of 
their ﬁ ndings or solution strategies. At a minimum 
they could explain their results to the teacher in 
written and/or oral form.
When assigning homework to a class, some 
teachers allow students to try the most difﬁ cult 
problems ﬁ rst. If students can solve the most dif-
ﬁ cult problems, then they do not need to solve all 
the problems on the assignment. In this instance all 
students should have the opportunity to try solving 
only the difﬁ cult problems. It may be surprising to 
see who tries to do so. At times students who suc-
cessfully solve the most difﬁ cult problems are not 
the ones the teacher might have identiﬁ ed as gifted 
and talented.
Another approach used by some teachers pro-
vides the opportunity for gifted students to test out 
of a unit of study. For example, a gifted student might 
try the unit test at the start of the unit. If the child 
scores high enough, then she might spend math-
ematics time on a project or exploration in lieu of 
the unit topic. This will prevent gifted students from 
spending time in what they do not need, review of 
a topic that the rest of the class must practice. As 
suggested earlier, the results of their explorations 
might be reported to the class and certainly to the 
teacher.
A common strategy that many teachers use is 
to have gifted and talented children tutor or assist 
students who are having difﬁ culty with a particular 
topic. It is true that both can beneﬁ t from such an ar-
rangement; the struggling students receive individu-
alized help, and the gifted students explicitly explain 
the mathematics at hand, perhaps formalizing their 
innate understanding of a topic. However, gifted 
and talented students are in school to advance their 
own mathematics, not to teach others, which is the 
teacher’s responsibility. We recommend that gifted 
and talented students be used sparingly as tutors or 
teachers.
All the preceding discussion applies to large-
group instruction or individualized assignments. 
When forming small groups with gifted and talented 
students, teachers should place one gifted student in 
a group with regular students or form a group com-
posed of all gifted and talented students. When a 
gifted student is in a small group with regular stu-
dents, both beneﬁ t. Regular students beneﬁ t from 
observing the effort and time on task that many 
gifted students exhibit. They also beneﬁ t from the 
insights gifted children have and the conclusions 
that they make. The gifted children beneﬁ t by de-
veloping interpersonal skills and by framing their 
mathematics concepts into formal expressions that 
they can communicate to others. By doing so, they 
solidify the foundations for building even more ad-
vanced mathematical understandings.
When only gifted students work together in a 
small group, they have the opportunity to work with 
peers who are able to assimilate and organize in-
formation quickly and completely. They can work 
with group members who are able to conceptual-
ize relationships and make conclusions as quickly 
as they can. As a group, much should be expected 
of them. They should produce excellent results, far 
beyond those expected of other groups. In addition, 
they should make a class presentation of their ﬁ nd-
ings so that the entire class can beneﬁ t from their 
concerted efforts.
In closing, having gifted students in the class-
room requires a teacher to ensure that their educa-
tional needs are met, just as the needs of all other 
children are met. At times, gifted students can be 
frustrating, charming, and inspiring, all in the same 
day. That is simply who they are, and it is the chal-
lenge for a classroom teacher to help these children 
achieve and meet their potential in mathematics.
Individual Learning Styles
Mathematics teachers work not only with students 
of many ethnic and cultural backgrounds, language 
differences, and learning capabilities but also with 
students with individual learning styles. Recent re-
search and theories about learning point out differ-
ences in children’s learning styles and strengths.

Multiple 
Intelligences
The theory of multiple 
intelligences was ﬁ rst 
proposed 
by 
Howard 
Gardner in 1983. In Frames 
of the Mind: The Theory 
of Multiple Intelligences,
Gardner asserts that peo-
ple are capable, or even 
gifted, in different ways. Gardner, Kagan and Ka-
gan, and other advocates of multiple intelligences 
believe that no single description of intelligence 
exists. Intelligence tests focus on only one type of 
learning, typically verbal knowledge, but individuals 
are “smart in different ways” (Kagan & Kagan, 1998, 
p. xix). Gardner initially identiﬁ ed seven intelligences: 
linguistic, logical/mathematical, spatial, body/kin -
 esthetic, musical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. 
He has since added an eighth intelligence: natural-
ist. Figure 3.1 gives a short description of each of the 
eight intelligences.
In each intelligence area, individual differences 
also occur. Individuals may feel more comfortable 
with some of the intelligences and less comfortable 
with others. Differences may occur within an intelli-
gence; a person might be comfortable writing prose 
but not at all comfortable writing poetry or speak-
ing before an audience. A person with the natural-
ist intelligence may be comfortable around plants 
but have little interest in animals. Linguistic (verbal) 
intelligence has been the mainstay of traditional 
schooling. Even logical/mathematical intelligence, 
strongly related to problem solving, reasoning, and 
mathematical thinking, receives little attention in 
classrooms where teacher-directed lessons are the 
primary means of instruction.
In real-world activities the intelligences are inte-
grated, and several may be needed to complete com-
plex tasks. Carpeting a house requires a number of 
intelligences: drawing a picture of each room (spa-
tial), measuring each room (bodily/kinesthetic), 
calculating square yards and cost (logical/mathe-
matical), and discussing choices and making selec-
tions (linguistic and interpersonal). By offering all 
children a rich curriculum with a variety of hands-
on problem-solving activities, teachers provide the 
variety needed to appeal to and develop all the 
intelligences.

Learning Styles
Learning styles is another way of describing how 
people receive, process, and respond to their world. 
Learning modalities is one way of describing 
learning. Do learners prefer to process informa-
tion visually, auditorily, kinesthetically, or in some 
combination? Do learners prefer to learn individu-
ally or in groups, with quiet or background noise, in 
structured or open-ended assignments (Carbo et al., 
1986)? Other style descriptions focus on speciﬁ c as-
pects of learning and personality on a continuum. 
Table 3.8 lists eight different learning styles with 
the related adjectives at the extreme points of the 
continuum.
Based on present research and understanding of 
individual differences, teachers cannot design les-
sons speciﬁ c to the styles and intelligences of each 
child. Instead, effective teaching must allow for 
learning needs of a wide variety of learners. Variety 
in teaching approaches, use of materials, focus on

meaning, and relating to individual needs and inter-
ests are key ideas in teaching the many students in 
any classroom. The characteristics of good teach-
ing are congruent with constructivist principles, re-
search on effective teaching, and strategies for a di-
verse classroom. A balanced approach encourages 
student thinking and creativity, autonomy of thought 
and action, and meaningful learning in many con-
texts. Design of worthwhile and challenging math-

Summary
Students have special learning needs in mathematics. Stu-
dents with disabilities may need classroom adaptations 
to support their learning. Gifted and talented students 
need additional challenges. Students who have limited 
English proﬁ ciency will require accommodations to sup-
port their mathematics learning. Multiple intelligences 
and learning styles underscore the need for variety in 
teaching and learning activities in the classroom because 
all students have individual learning characteristics. We 
no longer try to teach all students the same way, reason-
ing that equal treatment for all students means equitable 
treatment. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter said, 
“There is no greater inequality than the equal treatment 
of un-equals.” Treating all children the same does not 
ensure that they are all treated fairly. Treating children 
fairly requires providing all of them with opportunities 
to reach their full potential in mathematics regardless 
of what individual accommodations are needed. Only 
when children’s needs are met can it be said that they 
are treated equally.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Look through a recent elementary school mathemat-
ics textbook series to see if it portrays a good mix of 
male/female, majority/minority, and children with/
without physical disabilities. What effect do you 
believe the children portrayed in textbooks have on 
the children who use those books?
 2.  At what level of schooling—early elementary, 
intermediate grades, junior high, senior high, or col-
lege—do you believe the best mathematics teaching 
occurs? Why?
 3.  Do a ministudy of yourself. Which of the eight intel-
ligences discussed in this chapter do you think best 
characterize you? What personal characteristics 
prompted you to name these intelligences?
 4.  How would you characterize your learning style?
 5.  Print out the abstracts for three to ﬁ ve research 
articles dealing with gifted students. What did you 
learn from reading these abstracts that is useful to 
you as a teacher? Which articles would you like to 
read in full?
 6.  What is the difference between ethnomathematics 
and multiculturalism?

Learning 
Mathematics
hen states and local school districts develop curricula using 
the NCTM principles and standards, they answer the ques-
tion, What mathematics should students know? Accord-
ing to the standards in Principles and Standards for School 
Mathe matics (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 
2000), students need conceptual knowledge and skills in numerical opera-
tions, geometry, measurement, data analysis, probability, and algebra 
with an emphasis on problem solving and application in meaningful 
contexts.
 
The next question for teachers is, How should I teach mathematics? 
The NCTM principle of teaching and the principle of learning address this 
question. Knowledge about learning and effective teaching are based on 
learning theory and research and are veriﬁ ed in classroom practice. Teach-
ers who understand how children grasp concepts in mathematics provide 
instructional experiences that support the needs of the learner and the 
demands of the content. The learning needs of a diverse student population 
reinforce the need for teachers to understand how students learn mathemat-
ics. In this chapter we review theories of learning and research on learning 
mathematics.

CHAPTER 4

48 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Learning is a complex cognitive process. For more 
than 100 years psychologists have observed people 
as they mastered skills; from their observations 
they formed new concepts and developed learning 
theories to explain this complex process. No single 
theory explains all the nuances and complexities 
involved in learning. However, understanding vari-
ous learning theories provides a foundation for the 
choices that teachers make in their teaching. A brief 
synopsis of learning theories as they relate to teach-
ing mathematics reinforces information from child 
development or educational psychology in the con-
text of mathematics instruction.
Theories of Learning
Behaviorism
Behaviorism is a theory of learning that focuses 
on observable behaviors and on ways to increase 
behaviors deemed positive and decrease behaviors 
deemed undesirable. In the late 19th century the 
“mental discipline” theory of learning inﬂ uenced 
the way mathematics was taught. According to this 
theory, the mind is like a muscle and beneﬁ ts from 
exercise, just as muscles do. Early in the 20th century 
stimulus-response theory explained that learning 
occurs when a bond, or connection, is established 
between a stimulus and a response. Thorndike, Pav-
lov, Skinner, and others demonstrated the effects of 
different conditioning plans on a variety of animals. 
Positive reinforcement, such as rewards of food 
or water, led animals to perform a task again and 
again. Animals could be trained to respond to a cer-
tain stimulus by prior rewards.
Behaviorism has a long history in teaching, as 
many teachers subscribe to the stimulus-response 
theory by “exercising” the brain. Drill and practice 
of facts and mathematical procedures is based on a 
belief that repetition establishes strong bonds. Since 
the 1930s researchers and theoreticians have chal-
lenged the stimulus-response theory as too simplis-
tic to explain all learning. If learning occurs only as 
a response to a stimulus, how can people create new 
words, new art, new music, new inventions, or even 
new theories? Cognitive and information theories 
explore how learning is inﬂ uenced by language and 
culture, individual and social experiences, intention 
and motivation, and neurophysiological processes.
E X E RC I S E
Can you think of something you have learned 
through repetition? What happened when you 
continued to practice the skill or knowledge? What 
happened when you stopped practicing? •••
Cognitive Theories
Cognitive theories share a common belief that men-
tal processes occur between the stimulus and re-
sponse. Mental processes, or cognitions, although 
not directly observable, result in highly individual-
ized responses or learning; therefore human beings 
learn by creating their own unique understandings 
from their experiences. The major differences be-
tween behaviorist and cognitive theories are sum-
marized in Table 4.1.
Different cognitive theories explain learning 
by emphasizing different aspects. Some cognitive 
theories focus on how complex learning proceeds 
from one level or stage to the next. Cognitive-
developmental theories, such as those of Jean 
Piaget, Richard Skemp, and Jerome Bruner, propose 
levels of successively more complex intellectual 
understanding or conceptualization. Other theories 
explain learning through the functions or mecha-
nisms that are involved. Information-processing 
models compare learning to computer functions, 
and brain-based theories explain learning in terms 
of how the brain receives, stores, and retrieves infor-
mation. Constructivism is another term associated 
with cognitive theories. Regardless of the particular 
model used, cognitive theories center around the 
idea of constructing meaning from experience.
Key Concepts in Learning 
Mathematics
Focus on Meaning
In the 1930s the meaning theory of William 
Brownell challenged the mental exercise and train-
ing focus of the stimulus-response theory. Brownell’s 
meaning theory suggested that children must un-
derstand what they are learning if learning is to be 
permanent. When children generate their own solu-
tions to problems while investigating the meanings 
of mathematical concepts with manipulative materi-
als and other learning aids, they are demonstrating 
E

49
the meaning theory (Brownell, 1986). Marilyn Burns, 
a leading mathematics educator, also emphasizes 
the importance of meaning in learning mathemat-
ics. She suggests that teachers must do “what makes 
sense” rather than teaching by rote (Burns, 1993).
E X E RC I S E
Can you think of something you “learned” even if 
you did not understand it? How did that experience 
make you feel? How d o you feel when you learn 
something you really understand? •••
Developmental Stages
Piaget described learning in four stages: sensorimo-
tor, preoperational, concrete operational, and for-
mal operational. The sensorimotor stage occurs 
between birth and age 2– 3 years. Foundations for 
later mental growth and mathematical understand-
ing are developed at this stage. For instance, chil-
dren learn to recognize people and things and to 
hold mental images when the people or things can 
no longer be seen. This ability, called object per-
manence, is essential for recalling past experiences 
to connect with new experiences. Rather than “out 
of sight, out of mind,” children need to be able to re-
member events, objects, and ideas even when they 
are no longer present.
E
During the preoperational stage (age 2– 3 to 
age 6– 7), children gradually change from being 
egocentric and dominated by their idiosyncratic 
perceptions of the world to beginning to become 
aware of feelings and points of view of others in 
their world. Children develop symbol systems, in-
cluding objects, pictures, actions, and language, 
to represent their experience. Blocks can be build-
ings or trucks, cups or plates, people or numbers. 
Representing ideas and actions with objects is an 
important step toward understanding pictures and, 
later, symbols. Children’s concepts of number and 
space start with concrete objects and interactions 
with peers and adults.
During the concrete operational stage (ages 
7– 12), children master the underlying structure of 
number, geometry, and measurement. Work with 
concrete objects is the foundation for developing 
mathematical concepts represented with pictures, 
symbols, and mental images. Children learn about 
classiﬁ cation systems based on attributes of objects, 
events, and people and how they are alike and dif-
ferent. They gradually consider multiple attributes si-
multaneously: The cube is red, rough, thick, and big; 
the triangle is yellow, thin, smooth, and small (Fig -
ure 4.1). Children recognize actions that are revers-
ible or inverses, such as opening and closing doors 
or joining and separating sets. Addition and subtrac-

tion are reversible because one reverses, or undoes, 
the other. Children learn to think about parts and 
wholes needed in fractions and division. Manipula-
tions of objects and pictures develop into mental 
images and operations as children internalize those 
actions.
Starting at ages 11– 13, more sophisticated ways 
of thinking about mathematics, including propor-
tional reasoning, propositional reasoning, and cor-
relational reasoning, begin and continue to develop 
during the teenage years and into adulthood. For-
mal operational thinking enables children and 
adults to form hypotheses, analyze situations to 
consider all factors that bear on them, draw conclu-
sions, and test them against reality.
Through the stages of learning and interaction 
with objects, events, and people in their world, 
children construct meaning for new experiences 
in relation to old ideas and experiences. Complex 
mental structures, or schema, represent the unique 
understanding of how the world works. As new ex-
periences are assimilated, or taken into the mental 
framework, they are compared to existing schema. 
If they do not correspond, they create a state of dis-
equilibrium. Disequilibrium ends when learners rec-
oncile new experiences through accommodation 
or by modifying their understanding. Piaget saw 
learning as a continual process of assimilation and 
accommodation. Confusion and making mistakes 
in the process of assimilation and accommodation 
are natural and necessary parts of constructing new 
schema.
Social Interactions
Lev Vygotsky believed that interactions between 
the learner and the physical world are strongly in-
ﬂ uenced by social interactions; his theory is called 
social constructivism. According to Vygotsky 
(1962), learning is enhanced as adults and peers 
provide language and feedback while learners pro-
cess experiences. The zone of proximal develop-
ment is just beyond the learner’s current capabilities 
but can be reached with assistance from adults or 
peers. Scaffolding occurs when adults or peers sup-
port learners while they construct meaning from 
their experience.
Concrete Experiences
Richard Skemp describes learning at two levels: ex-
perience and abstraction. Interaction with physical 
objects during the early stages of concept learning 
provides a foundation for later internalization of 
ideas. Later, physical experiences are processed 
again at the abstract level. An underlying structure, 
or schema, allows prior learning to serve as a basis 
for future learning. Time for reﬂ ection and opportu-
nity to use knowledge are essential for organizing 
thoughts.
Similar ideas about using physical models for 
conceptual learning were proposed by Dienes 
(1969). His work with manipulatives, such as base-10 
blocks (Dienes blocks), convinced him that learn-
ing improved when concepts were shown in “mul-
tiple embodiments” rather than a single representa-
tion; place value can be demonstrated with base-10 
blocks in addition to bundles of stirring sticks, bean 
sticks, and Uniﬁ x cubes.
Levels of Representation
Jerome Bruner (1960) was interested in how chil-
dren recognize and represent concepts. Like Dienes, 
Bruner advocated discovery learning and learning 
through hands-on activities. Bruner’s ﬁ rst stage of 
representation is enactive, suggesting the role of 
physical objects in learning. The second level is 
ikonic, referring to pictorial and graphic represen-
tations. Finally, the symbolic level involves using 
words, numerals, and other symbols to represent 
ideas, objects, and actions. Bruner’s levels of rep-
resentation are related to both Piaget’s stages and 
Skemp and Dienes’s ideas about the need for physi-
cal experiences in the development of meaning.

Procedural Learning
Learning a procedure, how to do something, is 
another important aspect in mathematics. James 
Hiebert and Patricia Lefevre (1986) deﬁ ne proce-
dural knowledge as recognizing symbols and learn-
ing rules. Recognizing symbols is illustrated when 
a child identiﬁ es “” as a plus or addition sign but 
does not know what addition means. Learning 
the rules and steps of an algorithm is procedural 
learning. If students learn procedures without their 
meanings, they often use the procedures at inap-
propriate times. “Invert and multiply” is a procedure 
that is often misapplied because students do not un-
derstand when or why the procedure makes sense.
Conceptual knowledge provides meaning for pro-
cedures. Conceptual knowledge is a schema built 
on many rich relationships. A student who knows 
when joining sets is needed and follows the symbols 
and procedures in solving a problem demonstrates 
both conceptual understanding and procedural 
knowledge of addition. Estimation skills draw on 
understanding the concepts behind procedures. If 
asked to ﬁ nd the square root of 950, a student might 
say, “I don’t remember the steps, but the answer is 
a little more than 30 because 30  30 is 900.” A stu-
dent who has only memorized the procedure for cal-
culating square roots will say, “I don’t remember the 
rule, so I don’t know the square root of 950.”
Short-Term to Long-Term Memory
Although cognitive scientists agree that cognitive 
processes occur between stimulus and response, 
exactly how learning occurs is still a subject of 
lively debate. One cognitive theory—information 
processing—uses a computer as a metaphor for 
learning. Instinctual behavior is similar to read-only 
memory (ROM) in a computer; it is preprogrammed. 
Random access memory (RAM) is short-term mem-
ory that the computer receives and stores temporar-
ily but does not retain when turned off. Learning be-
comes permanent when new ideas and experiences 
are transferred from short-term memory to long-term 
memory, where it is stored for later retrieval and use. 
Information is stored in the computer’s permanent 
memory based on the needs and choices of the 
computer user.
Lefrancois (2000) describes the similarities and 
differences between learning by humans and learn-
ing by computers with models and metaphors. The 
neural network, or connectionist, model has appeal 
because it mirrors the structure of the human brain 
and accounts for the dynamic nature of learning. 
Neural networks are similar to the constructivist 
idea of schema. Which memories are stored and 
how they are retrieved in the brain are apparently 
controlled by the learner’s emotions, motivations, 
and intentions. Deciding what is important to re-
member and making meaning from experience in-
crease retention and retrieval. Strong emotions also 
appear to aid memory. The brain mechanisms be-
hind human emotions, motivations, and intentions 
are not fully understood, although many cognitive 
scientists continue to investigate brain anatomy and 
functioning.
Pattern Making
In the past 30 years new technologies designed for 
medical diagnosis have enabled researchers to “see” 
which parts of the brain are active during learning 
activities. According to Leslie Hart, learning occurs 
because the brain is built to ﬁ nd patterns and to 
make connections between experiences. “Learning 
[is] the extraction from confusion of meaningful 
patterns” (Hart 1983, p. 67). Hart suggests six prem-
ises about how the brain is built to learn:
1.  The brain is by nature a magniﬁ cent pattern-
detecting apparatus, even in the early years.
2.  Pattern detection and identiﬁ cation involves 
both features and relationships and is greatly 
speeded up by the use of clues and categoriz -
ing . . . procedure[s].
3.  Negative clues play an essential role.
4.  The brain uses clues in a probabilistic fashion, 
not by . . . adding up.
5.  Pattern recognition depends heavily on what 
experience one brings to a situation.
6.  Children and youngsters must often revise 
the patterns they have extracted, to ﬁ t new 
experiences.
Instead of being a passive receiver of stimuli, the 
brain is an active processor of information. How the 
brain turns experience into knowledge is still being 
explored, but the formation of synaptic and dendritic 
connections between brain cells appears to be the 
biological mechanism of learning. Regardless, the 
conclusion is that the brain makes sense of experi-

ences by ﬁ nding relations and connections between 
old and new information (Jensen, 1998, pp. 90– 98). 
Children process experiences into knowledge and 
skills because they have human brains.
Thinking to Learn
In reviewing the implications of brain research for 
teaching, Eric Jensen (1998) found two elements 
important: “First, the learning is challenging, with 
new information and experiences. . . . Second, there 
must be some way to learn from the experiences 
through interactive feedback” (pp. 32– 33). If learn-
ers are engaged in novel, complex, and varied expe-
riences, they become critical thinkers and problem 
solvers. Interactive feedback includes both internal 
and external information: what children tell them-
selves and information received from adults, peers, 
and interactions with the physical world. Physical 
and social interactions provide new information for 
the construction of linguistic, social, scientiﬁ c, and 
mathematical knowledge.
The metaphors for learning from computer and 
brain models connect with constructivist theories of 
learning:
•  People create meaning by ﬁ nding relationships 
and patterns in their experiences.
•  What people learn and how they learn and how 
long they remember depend on unique motiva-
tions, intentions, and emotions of individual 
learners.
Human beings undoubtedly learn some things 
in behaviorist ways. The hot stove is a stimulus 
that evokes a strong, immediate, and long-lasting 
response in the unwary toddler or adult. Repeat-
ing a telephone number keeps it active in short-
term memory. But humans use more sophisticated 
learning strategies than instinct and repetition; they 
perform unexpected and complex cognitive tasks 
when they learn concepts, act creatively, and solve 
problems. Cognitive theories conjecture that people 
transcend their immediate physical sensations and 
think. Cognitive theories are generalizations about 
learning because individuals learn in idiosyncratic 
ways based on their experiences, intentions, social 
interaction, and maturity. The theories are complex 
because human learning is complex.
Research in Learning and 
Teaching Mathematics
Theories about learning are developed and tested 
through research studies on how children learn and 
how teachers teach mathematics. Through educa-
tional research, educators and psychologists ask 
and answer questions about how children learn 
and how teachers can improve their effectiveness 
in teaching. Research describes, explains, and pro-
vides information about learning and teaching.
By reading research and research summaries, 
teachers learn more about how children learn 
and what techniques can be used to improve their 
learning. With electronic databases and search en -
gines, teachers can ﬁ nd research studies on almost 
any topic in teaching or learning mathematics. The 
ERIC Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics, and 
Environmental Education is the major source of 
research information about mathematics with the 
AskERIC database (available at http://ericir.syr.edu). 
For example, by entering the key words fractions,
elementary mathematics, and research, a complete 
bibliography of research studies and other articles 
provide research about teaching and learning 
fractions. Figure 4.2 shows the abstract of a study 
from the ERIC database that describes misconcep-
tions about fractions. A search on “research” into 
“problem solving” strategies yields an abstract 
(Figure 4.3) that explains kindergartners’ problem-
solving processes. After reading the abstract, teach-
ers can decide whether they want to read the entire 
study.
In educational journals and full-text online ser-
vices, teachers can ﬁ nd complete studies that in-
clude questions they are trying to answer, the sub-
jects who participated in the study, how data were 
collected and analyzed, and conclusions or an-
swers drawn from the data. InfoTrac College Edition 
and EBSCO are other database services that allow 
searches and offer many full-text articles.

Abstract: Students come to the classroom with theories that they have actively constructed from their everyday 
experiences. However, some of these theories are incomplete half-truths. Although such misconceptions interfere 
with new learning, students are often emotionally and intellectually attached to them. Some common mathematical 
misconceptions involve: (1) confusion between variables and labels, with failure to understand that variables stand 
for numerical expressions; (2) mistakes about the way that an original price and a sale price reﬂ ect one another; 
(3) misconceptions about the independent nature of chance events; and (4) reluctance to multiply fractions. Hispanic 
students display some unique mathematical error patterns resulting from differences in language or culture. In addition, 
linguistic difﬁ culties increase the frequency with which Hispanic students commit the same errors as Anglo students. Since 
students will not easily give up their misconceptions, lecturing them on a particular topic has little effect. Instead, teachers 
must help students to dismantle their own misconceptions.
One effective technique induces conﬂ ict by drawing out the contradictions in students’ misconceptions. In the three steps 
of this technique, the teacher probes for qualitative, quantitative, and conceptual understanding, asking questions rather 
than telling students the right answer.
In the process of resolving the conﬂ icts that arise, students actively reconstruct the concept in question and truly overcome 
their misconceptions.

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Research in Mathematics Education (English, 2003) 
collect current reviews of research on important top-
ics for teaching and learning. ERIC digests provide 
short summaries of research and research-based 
best practices.
Based on a review of research, Grouws and Ce-
bulla (2002) made 10 recommendations (available 
at http://www.ericse.org/digests/dse00-10.html) with direct 
application for teachers of mathematics. Current re-
search is also available through the website of the 
National Center for Improving Student Learning and 
Achievement in Mathematics and Science (available 
at http://www.wcer.wisc.edu /ncisla/).
Recommendations given in Table 4.2 support 
cognitive theories about learning. Constructivist 
teaching depends on teachers knowing how chil-
dren learn and connecting important content to the 
needs and interests of the learner. Galileo wrote, 
“You cannot teach a man anything; you can only 
help him ﬁ nd it within himself.” Constructivist 
teaching has roots in the theories of Piaget, Bruner, 
Skemp, and Vygotsky and is consistent with current 
research on teaching and learning. Research is the 
foundation for the recommendations about learning 
and teaching found in the Principles and Standards 
for School Mathematics (National Council of Teach-
ers of Mathematics, 2000). NCTM continually up-
dates research through its publications such as Les-
sons Learned from Research (Sowder & Schappelle, 
2002). Gerald A. Goldin (1990, p. 31) cites six themes 
on which teaching mathematics in a constructivist 
manner is based:
TABLE 4.2 •  Recommendations Based on Research for Improving 
Student Achievement in Mathematics
1.  The extent of the students’ opportunity to learn mathematics content bears directly and decisively on student 
mathematics achievement.
2.  Focusing instruction on the meaningful development of important mathematical ideas increases the level of 
student learning.
 
•  Emphasize the mathematical meanings of ideas, including how the idea, concept, or skill is connected in multiple ways 
to other mathematical ideas in a logically consistent and sensible manner.
 
•  Create a classroom learning context in which students can construct meaning.
 
•  Make explicit the connections between mathematics and other subjects.
 
•  Attend to student meanings and student understandings.
3.  Students can learn both concepts and skills by solving problems.
Research suggests that it is not necessary for teachers to focus ﬁ rst on skill development and then move on to problem 
solving. Both can be done together. Skills can be developed on an as-needed basis, or their development can be 
supplemented through the use of technology. In fact, there is evidence that if students are initially drilled too much on 
isolated skills, they have a harder time making sense of them later.
4.  Giving students both an opportunity to discover and invent new knowledge and an opportunity to practice 
what they have learned improves student achievement.
Balance is needed between the time students spend practicing routine procedures and the time they devote to inventing 
and discovering new ideas. To increase opportunities for invention, teachers should frequently use nonroutine problems, 
periodically introduce a lesson involving a new skill by posing it as a problem to be solved, and regularly allow students to 
build new knowledge based on their intuitive knowledge and informal procedures.
5.  Teaching that incorporates students’ intuitive solution methods can increase student learning, especially 
when combined with opportunities for student interaction and discussion.
Research results suggest that teachers should concentrate on providing opportunities for students to interact in problem-
rich situations. Besides providing appropriate problem-rich situations, teachers must encourage students to ﬁ nd their 
own solution methods and give them opportunities to share and compare their solution methods and answers. One 
way to organize such instruction is to have students work in small groups initially and then share ideas and solutions in a 
whole-class discussion.
6.  Using small groups of students to work on activities, problems, and assignments can increase student 
mathematics achievement.
When using small groups for mathematics instruction, teachers should:
•  Choose tasks that deal with important mathematical concepts and ideas
•  Select tasks that are appropriate for group work

 
Chapter 4 Learning Mathematics 
55
1.  Mathematics is viewed as invented or constructed 
by human beings; it is not an independent body 
of “truths” or an abstract and necessary set of 
rules.
2.  Mathematical meaning is constructed by the 
learner rather than imparted by the teacher.
3.  Mathematical learning occurs most effectively 
through guided discovery, meaningful applica-
tion, and problem solving rather than imitation 
and reliance on the rote use of algorithms for 
manipulating symbols.
4.  Study and assessment of learners must occur 
through individual interviews and small-group 
observations that go beyond paper-and-pencil 
tests.
5.  Effective teaching occurs through the creation of 
classroom learning environments that encourage 
the development of diverse and creative 
problem-solving processes in students.
6.  Teachers must consider the origins of math-
ematical knowledge to understand that such 
knowledge is constructed and that mathematical 
learning is a constructive process.
A constructivist teacher develops opportunities 
for children to activate prior knowledge and to ac-
quire, understand, apply, and reﬂ ect on knowledge 
(Zahorik, 1995). Teachers who understand both 
the structure of mathematics and the processes of 
learning create classrooms that lead to success for 
the learners.
TABLE 4.2 •  Continued
•  Consider having students initially work individually on a task and then follow with group work where students share 
and build on their individual ideas and work
•  Give clear instructions to the groups and set clear expectations
•  Emphasize both group goals and individual accountability
•  Choose tasks that students ﬁ nd interesting
•  Ensure that there is closure to the group work, where key ideas and methods are brought to the surface either by the 
teacher or the students, or both
 7.  Whole-class discussion following individual and group work improves student achievement.
It is important that whole-class discussion follows student work on problem-solving activities. The discussion should be 
a summary of individual work in which key ideas are brought to the surface. This can be accomplished through students 
presenting and discussing their individual solution methods, or through other methods of achieving closure that are led 
by the teacher, the students, or both.
 8.  Teaching mathematics with a focus on number sense encourages students to become problem solvers in a 
wide variety of situations and to view mathematics as a discipline in which thinking is important.
Competence in the many aspects of number sense is an important mathematical outcome for students. Over 90% of 
the computation done outside the classroom is done without pencil and paper, using mental computation, estimation, 
or a calculator. However, in many classrooms, efforts to instill number sense are given insufﬁ cient attention.
 9.  Long-term use of concrete materials is positively related to increases in student mathematics achievement 
and improved attitudes toward mathematics.
Research suggests that teachers use manipulative materials regularly in order to give students hands-on experience that 
helps them construct useful meanings for the mathematical ideas they are learning. Use of the same materials to teach 
multiple ideas over the course of schooling shortens the amount of time it takes to introduce the material and helps 
students see connections between ideas.
10.  Using calculators in the learning of mathematics can result in increased achievement and improved student 
attitudes.
One valuable use for calculators is as a tool for exploration and discovery in problem-solving situations and when 
introducing new mathematical content. By reducing computation time and providing immediate feedback, calculators 
help students focus on understanding their work and justifying their methods and results. The graphing calculator is 
particularly useful in helping to illustrate and develop graphical concepts and in making connections between algebraic 
and geometric ideas.

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Teachers and Action Research
Many teachers do not realize that by asking and 
answering questions about student learning and 
effective teaching, they conduct research in their 
classrooms. Teachers describe, explain, and try 
methods to improve their students’ learning. They 
assess student learning by collecting data, draw-
ing conclusions, and changing their techniques to 
increase learning. This process, called classroom 
action research, is central to improving teaching 
and learning. Many articles in the journal Teaching 
Children Mathematics are based on practices that 
teachers deem successful. For example, Ambrose 
and Falkner (2001) report on students’ thinking, un-
derstanding of concepts, and use of geometry vo-
cabulary as a result of building polyhedra. In some 
issues of Teaching Children Mathematics a problem 
for students is presented, and several months later 
a follow-up article shows different student solutions 
with a discussion of various strategies. This feature 
gives teachers insight into student thinking and 
models classroom research.
Summary
Learning theories and research provide understanding of 
learning and teaching processes for teachers. Although 
behaviorist theories and practices of drill and practice 
have often dominated mathematics instruction, new re-
search supports a more cognitive approach to teaching. 
The cognitive approach recognizes the importance of 
individual differences in motivation, emotion, experi-
ence, language, and culture and how these differences 
can inﬂ uence how and what students learn. Key ideas 
for teaching based on cognitive theories include focus 
on meaning, developmental stages in learning, social 
interaction, concrete experiences with multiple repre-
sentations, learning meaningful procedures, building 
long-term strategic memory, and ﬁ nding patterns. As indi-
cated by cognitive research and theories, teachers need 
to provide instruction that engages students actively in 
constructing mathematical concepts and building skills 
in a meaningful context.
Through journals and technology teachers have ac-
cess to the latest research about learning and teaching. 
Speciﬁ c studies or reviews of research that summarize 
and synthesize current research are found in journals and 
online. Teachers also ask and answer questions in their 
own classrooms as they assess student learning and de-
termine which techniques are most effective for learners.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Bransford and colleagues (1999, p. 108) said, “The 
alliance of factual knowledge, procedural proﬁ -
ciency, and conceptual understanding makes all 
three components usable in powerful ways. Stu-
dents who memorize facts or procedures without 
understanding often are not sure when or how to 
use what they know, and such learning is often quite 
fragile.” Is this approach more behaviorist or cogni-
tive in nature? Explain your answer.
 2.  Compare the recommendations for teachers from re-
search by Grouws and Cebulla (2002) with the “key 
ideas” from cognitive theories. Which points match 
between them and which do not?

Organizing 
Effective 
Instruction
ffective teaching strategies in mathematics emerge when 
learning theories, research on teaching and learning, and 
successful teaching practices are taken into consideration 
and drawn upon. Constructivism is the theory that best 
explains the complexities of learning mathematical 
concepts and procedures in a developmental process. By exploring 
materials and discussing interesting mathematics-rich problems, students 
construct mathematical concepts and develop skills. In a challenging and 
supportive classroom, teachers organize mathematical tasks and encour-
age student engagement and communication by the way they manage 
space, time, and materials. In this chapter we describe how teachers make 
plans and implement instruction and how the decisions they make foster 
conceptual and procedural knowledge.

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
What Is Effective 
Mathematics Teaching?
New and experienced teachers ask two questions 
about their mathematics teaching:
1.  What concepts, skills, and applications should 
children learn?
2.  What are the most effective ways to develop 
these concepts, skills, and applications?
The ﬁ rst question, about the expected content and 
processes of mathematics, can be answered by re-
ferring to the state and district learning objectives, 
which are often based on the NCTM standards pre-
sented in Chapters 1 and 2. The answer to the sec-
ond question, about teaching content and process 
skills, is further developed in Part 2 of this text.
Effective teaching depends on the knowledge 
and skills that teachers bring to instruction decisions 
and the choices teachers make in implementing 
this pedagogical knowledge. Teachers must make 
many decisions about the way they teach. Teachers 
plan worthwhile mathematics experiences, interact 
with children while they are learning, and monitor 
student’s progress. Successful teachers understand 
how children learn and vary their teaching based 
on group and individual needs. Because no single 
instructional approach works for every child and 
every concept, effective teachers build a repertoire 
of instructional skills and techniques with charac-
teristics suggested by theory, research, and practice, 
such as those cited in Chapter 4.
•  Teachers engage children actively in learning.
•  Teachers encourage students to reﬂ ect on their 
experiences and construct meaning.
•  Teachers invite children to think at higher cogni-
tive levels.
•  Teachers help children connect mathematics to 
their lives.
•  Teachers encourage children to communicate 
their ideas in many forms and settings.
•  Teachers constantly monitor and assess students’ 
understanding and skill.
•  Teachers adjust their instruction to ﬁ t the needs, 
levels, and interests of children.
•  Teachers create a positive learning environment 
that supports critical and creative thinking.
Using Objectives to Guide 
Mathematics Instruction
Three classroom vignettes illustrate how teachers at 
different grade levels adapt lessons to match the con-
tent with the level of students. The general objective 
for each lesson is for students to collect data and 
represent information on a bar graph with a title and 
key and to draw conclusions based on the data.
First-Grade Graphing
Mr. Gable plans a lesson on classiﬁ cation and rep-
resentation for ﬁ rst-graders using the objective “Stu-
dents will sort 20 wooden blocks into groups by 
color and display the information on a bar graph.” 
Students gather in a circle on the ﬂ oor. Mr. Gable 
places a red ﬂ ower on red construction paper, a 
blue glove on blue paper, and a yellow ﬁ re engine 
on yellow paper. Students notice the objects match 
the color of the paper. He asks students where new 
objects belong, and children place them on the cor-
responding color. Students talk about which color 
has the most or least objects, how many more red 
has than yellow, and so forth (see Figure 5.1a).
(a)
(b)
Figure 5.1 (a) Object graph and (b) bar graph
Then Mr. Gable gives each pair of students 20 
blocks of three colors and matching construction 
paper. He asks them to sort the blocks by color and 
to count them. After placing the blocks in groups,
students move the blocks on 1-inch graph paper and 
color in the squares on the paper (see Figure 5.1b).
After putting graphs on a bulletin board, Mr. Ga-
ble asks questions: “How many graphs show seven
or more red cubes? Are there any graphs with fewer 
than three of a color? Which graph has the most red
cubes?” Activities and lessons over several weeks
focus on classifying and graphing.

Third-Grade Data Collection
Mrs. Alfaro plans a lesson with this objective: “Given 
centimeter-squared paper, students will collect data 
on a topic of their choice and construct a bar graph, 
including a title and key, showing the results.” She 
asks students to write their favorite sandwich on 
2-inch sticky notes with their initials. Students put 
their sticky notes on a white board with others of the 
same type: peanut butter, peanut butter with jelly, 
grilled cheese, bologna, bacon and tomato, and 
“other.” After grouping, they line the sticky notes up, 
starting at the base.
An overhead transparency of graph paper shows 
labeled columns with the six types of sandwiches. 
Initials of each child are transferred to a correspond-
ing square on the transparency. Finally, Mrs. Alfaro 
asks students to supply a title; the group decides on 
“Yum-Yum: Our Favorite Sandwiches.” She writes, “1 
square  1 sandwich” beneath the title and labels it 
the “key” for the graph (see Figure 5.2).
The next day, students work in groups of three 
to poll each other about other favorites: pizza, ice 
cream, sports teams, pets, singing groups, colors, 
and dream cars. Over two or three days, the stu-
dents collect data, organize them, and display them 
on graphs with titles and a key. The activity is con-
cluded when groups show their graphs and report 
conclusions drawn from them.
Students poll students in other classes to com-
pare their class results with those for other groups.
Sixth-Grade Rainfall Graph
Ms. Clary’s students have had experiences with bar 
graphs and know how to determine the mean aver-
age for a set of numbers, so she wants them to work 
independently on graphing for an interdisciplinary 
social studies and science unit on weather. The per-
formance task is, “Given a chart of the monthly rain-
fall for the last 10 years, students will use a computer 
spreadsheet to compute the mean average rainfall for 
each month, create a bar graph showing the mean av-
erage monthly rainfall, and write a short paragraph in 
which they describe weather trends over the 10 years 
using mean averages and extremes.” She allows the 
students to pick any city in the United States using 
data from almanacs and the Internet. After entering 
the data on the computer, students use the average 
function on the spreadsheet and create bar and line 
graphs. Students take turns working as computer 
consultants if problems occur.
After a week, each student has a table and bar 
graph of mean rainfall (see Figure 5.3) and an essay

about the weather pattern in the city. As they look 
for similarities and differences in rainfall patterns 
across the United States, they identify weather pat-
terns such as droughts, events such as El Niño and 
La Niña, and hurricanes.
Using standards and objectives as beginning 
points, these three teachers demonstrate character-
istics for successful teachers through their ﬂ exibility 
and adaptation. The content objectives and skill lev-
els are met with different tasks and materials, but all 
challenge students and encourage thinking.
Becoming an Effective Teacher
The three teachers from the vignettes exhibit excel-
lent teaching techniques. However, acquiring all 
the qualities of effective teaching does not occur 
overnight; teaching is a continuous improvement 
process. Ten principles for preparing new teachers 
were adopted by the Interstate New Teacher As-
sessment and Support Consortium (INTASC). The 
INTASC standards, listed in Table 5.1, outline what 
beginning teachers should know and be able to 
do. These statements provide a framework for new 
teachers entering the profession and are adapted 
by many states for new teachers. In practice, the 10 
standards are not 10 separate practices. Combined 
they represent what good teachers know and do on 
a daily basis.

tion standards in your state, describe how the 
teachers in each vignette exhibited the characteris-
tics of effective teaching. •••
Using Objectives in Planning 
Mathematics Instruction
Teachers coordinate and manage many instruc-
tional decisions as they create a classroom that en-
courages children’s mathematical thinking.
•  How do teachers plan lessons and units based on 
curriculum objectives?
•  What teaching approaches and strategies engage 
students in worthwhile learning activities?
Many states and school districts adopt or adapt the 
NCTM standards when writing their curriculum goals 
E
and performance objectives. Wording of objec-
tives varies, but the scope and sequence are often 
similar. Performance objectives, also called instruc-
tional objectives and learning targets or bench-
marks, describe what students should know and be 
TABLE 5.1 •  INTASC Beginning Teacher 
Standards
1. Content Pedagogy
The teacher understands the central concepts, tools of 
inquiry, and structures of the discipline he or she teaches 
and can create learning experiences that make these 
aspects of subject matter meaningful for students.
2. Student Development
The teacher understands how children learn and develop 
and can provide learning opportunities that support a 
child’s intellectual, social, and personal development.
3. Diverse Learners
The teacher understands how students differ in their 
approaches to learning and creates instructional 
opportunities that are adapted to diverse learners.
4. Multiple Instructional Strategies
The teacher understands and uses a variety of instruc-
tional strategies to encourage student development of 
critical thinking, problem solving, and performance skills.
5. Motivation and Management
The teacher uses an understanding of individual and 
group motivation and behavior to create a learning 
environment that encourages positive social interaction, 
active engagement in learning, and self-motivation.
6. Communication and Technology
The teacher uses knowledge of effective verbal, non-
verbal, and media communication techniques to foster 
active inquiry, collaboration, and supportive interaction in 
the classroom.
7. Planning
The teacher plans instruction based on knowledge of 
subject matter, students, the community, and curriculum 
goals.
8. Assessment
The teacher understands and uses formal and informal 
assessment strategies to evaluate and ensure the con-
tinuous intellectual, social, and physical development of 
the learner.
9. Reﬂ ective Practice: Professional Growth
The teacher is a reﬂ ective practitioner who continually 
evaluates the effects of his or her choices and actions 
on others (students, parents, and other professionals 
in the learning community) and who actively seeks out 
opportunities to grow professionally.
10. School and Community Involvement
The teacher fosters relationships with colleagues, par-
ents, and agencies in the larger community to support 
students’ learning and well-being.

able to do as a result of instruction. By knowing the 
expectations for the grade level they teach, as well 
as objectives for earlier and later grades, teachers 
see how content and skills develop over time. By 
aligning the curriculum, teams of teachers on the 
same grade level and across grade levels in a school 
coordinate their objectives, instructional practices, 
and assessments so that all children have a positive 
learning experience.
Long-Range Planning
In a long-range plan teachers outline how instruc-
tional topics and objectives for the year are devel-
oped and sequenced. Planning across the year al-
lows time for development, review, and extension 
of topics and balances instructional time so that 
all standards receive attention and build on one 
another. With increasing emphasis on accountabil-
ity, teachers also consider when state assessments 
are scheduled and make sure that content is devel-
oped and reviewed before the test. A fourth-grade 
teacher’s preliminary plan for the year is shown in 
Table 5.2. A long-range plan is subject to change 
to take advantage of learning opportunities and 
learner needs.
Unit Planning
Teachers create two- or three-week instructional 
units based on the long-range plan that included 
varied lessons and activities. A three-week instruc-
tional unit on addition and subtraction of two- and 
three-digit numbers in third grade might include 
eight directed teaching/thinking lessons, six learn-
ing center and computer-based activities, three 
games, and two investigations or student-centered 
projects. Multiple learning experiences provide for 
varied learning styles, interests, and abilities within 
the topic. Unit planning also considers various stu-
dent groupings from whole class to small group to 
individual learning.
Learning activities are sequenced so that new 
concepts and skills are introduced and developed 
in a logical way. A real-life or imagined problem cap-
tures children’s interest. Good instructional prob-
lems motivate learning and have mathematical con-
cepts and skills embedded in them. A teacher starts 
a lesson or unit with problems based on a children’s 
book, newspaper article, children’s lives, or manipu-
latives. How Many Snails: A Counting Book (by Paul 
Giganti) introduces counting, classiﬁ cation, subtrac-
tion, and fractions by asking students to count sets 
of objects with different attributes. A newspaper ar-
ticle states that the state is running out of telephone 
numbers and brings up questions about how many

telephone numbers are possible in any area code. 
This discussion includes large numbers, multiplica-
tion, and combinations.
Teachers also consider the sequence of activi-
ties in a unit. Teachers introduce new concepts with 
simple examples and move to more sophisticated 
concepts as children become successful. Patterning 
might be explored with A-B repetition ﬁ rst, then A-A-
B, then A-B-C and A-B-C-B. Measurement of length is 
modeled with paper clips and a chain of paper clips 
before the ruler is introduced. Students compare 
and classify the size of angles on triangles. Little, 
big, and corner angles are later renamed “acute, 
obtuse, and right” angles and are compared to an-
gles found in different ﬁ gures. As students gain skill 
and conﬁ dence, situations and vocabulary become 
more complex.
Effective teachers incorporate different levels of 
representation in lessons moving from concrete ob-
jects to pictures to symbols and eventually to mental 
images and operations. Mathematical concepts are 
developed using stories, models, pictures, tables 
and graphs, and number sentences or formulas. This 
sequence of introducing material to students builds 
understanding of essential attributes of mathemati-
cal concepts. Realistic contexts give way to sym-
bolic representations. Mental computation, number 
sense, reasonableness of answer, estimation, and 
spatial sense are indicators of students’ ability to 
reason abstractly.
Students also develop from speciﬁ c to general 
solutions. Learning the blue-blue-red pattern with 
blocks is speciﬁ c, but patterning is a fundamental 
thinking skill that extends beyond learning one 
pattern. Identifying and labeling many patterns in 
many situations and many forms (A-B-C, A-B-C-B, A-
A-B-C) creates a generalized skill. Finding the area 
of a rectangle or a triangle by counting square units 
is a solution strategy for that shape. However, noting 
that the area of rectangles is determined by multi-
plying the length by the height is a generalized rule. 
Finding that the area of a triangle is half the area 
of its related rectangle extends the ﬁ rst rule (Fig -
ure 5.4). As children take speciﬁ c solutions and gen-
erate a formula for the area of all triangles, they are 
thinking algebraically. Figure 5.5 summarizes some 
important sequences that teachers consider in plan-
ning their units to maximize student learning.

Daily Lesson Planning
The daily lesson plan focuses on the activities pre-
sented in a single day in the context of the unit plan 
as well as the long-range plan. Instructional decisions 
on a daily lesson plan are speciﬁ c, because teach-

 
Chapter 5 Organizing Effective Instruction 
63
ing optimizes student learning. Teachers ask, “What 
types of activities should I plan for today?” to guide 
children toward mastery of the objectives for the 
unit. Each day contributes to attainment of the unit, 
and teachers have several approaches available.
Varying Teaching Approaches
Some teachers believe that standards or curricu-
lum objectives limit their creativity and ﬂ exibility in 
teaching mathematics. Although standards guide in-
structional goals, effective teachers choose the tech-
niques and activities that address student learning 
styles, preferences, intelligences, and needs. Meet-
ing all students’ needs requires varied instructional 
approaches, including informal or exploratory activ-
ities, directed teaching/thinking lessons, and prob-
lem-based projects or investigations.
Informal or Exploratory Activities
When planning daily lessons, some lessons should 
provide time for students to informally explore con-
cepts. Work with manipulatives, playing games, and 
setting up learning centers are informal approaches 
that have many beneﬁ ts for student learning. Infor-
mal activities with manipulatives prepare children 
for directed teaching episodes and investigations 
with materials. Children are fascinated by new ma-
terials, so experienced teachers provide students 
exploratory time with materials before using them 
in directed activities. When students have worked 
with materials before a directed lesson, they con-
centrate on the content of the 
lesson rather than on the nov-
elty of the materials. Manipu-
latives have mathematics con-
cepts and skills embedded in 
them. When children spontane-
ously build a stair-step pattern 
with Cuisenaire rods (Figure 
5.6), they are modeling the plus-
1 rule for learning basic facts: 
1  1  2, 2  1  3, 3  1 
 4, and so on. Arranging pattern blocks is an explo-
ration of proportionality and fractional parts (Fig -
ure 5.7). Informal experiences give students a head 
start on understanding because they have already 
experienced a concept through their hands-on ex-
ploration. Finally, informal explorations invite cre-
ativity and critical thinking through open-ended 
tasks. Students create new uses and new rules with 
games and objects. Informal activities allow stu-
dents to individualize their learning. The teacher 
serves as a guide and facilitator while students work 
informally.
•  Individual student’s needs and interests can be 
addressed by offering choice as part of informal 
activities. Different children learn at different lev-
els of understanding with the same materials. In-
formal activities encourage independent thought 
and autonomous action, and they provide variety 
in the instructional approaches in the classroom.
•  By selecting the materials and the tasks care-
fully, teachers extend engaged learning time for 
students. While teachers work with individuals or 
small groups, students in the classroom explore 
materials and activities related to the objectives 
using directions from printed materials or task 
cards. Task cards coordinated with manipulatives 
challenge students to complete an activity. For 
example, a task card on patterning with colored 
shapes may leave several blank spaces for stu-
dents to complete the pattern with pattern blocks.
Informal activities provide valuable learning for all 
students when teachers select appropriate materials 
and tasks, monitor and assess student work, discuss 
the concepts being encountered, and introduce 
vocabulary related to the activities. If students es-
tablish a purpose for exploratory activities, they are 
more likely to see them as important. Children in all 
elementary grades, as well as middle and secondary 
levels, need exploratory experiences as new con-
cepts and materials are introduced. Informal activi-
ties, learning centers, and games extend skills and 
topics from a previous grade or earlier in the year.
Directed Teaching/Thinking Lessons
A different approach to daily planning is a directed 
teaching/thinking lesson. Some people see direct 
teaching as teacher-controlled or even scripted les-

naire rod stairs 
demonstrate 1.
Figure 5.7 Pattern blocks show fractional parts.

64 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
sons, but the directed teaching/thinking lesson 
in mathematics is interactive and incorporates ma-
nipulative materials, visual aids, discussion and 
argument, and interesting performance tasks to 
encourage thinking. A directed teaching/thinking 
lesson can be taught to small groups or the whole 
class. Small groups are often more effective because 
the teacher closely observes children’s work with 
materials, watches their eyes, and listens to their 
comments.
During a unit, the teacher uses the directed 
teaching/thinking format to introduce, reinforce, 
and extend key concepts and skills several times 
while working toward student mastery. A lesson plan 
serves as a road map for a well-thought-out lesson 
with a destination (the instructional objective) and 
a route (procedures needed to master the objec-
tive). Robert Gagne (1985) describes a well-planned 
lesson in nine events that can be grouped into three 
phases: preparation, presentation, and practice.
Preparation (Motivation and Preparation: 
Setting the Stage)
•  Gain the learner’s attention.
•  Inform the learner of the learning objective 
or task.
•  Recall prior experiences, information, and 
prerequisite skills.
Presentation (Instructional Input and Modeling)
•  Present new content or skills by demonstrating 
and describing critical attributes.
•  Provide guided practice with additional 
examples.
•  Elicit performance on a learning task.
•  Check for understanding.
Practice (Independent Practice)
•  Provide feedback and assess performance.
•  Apply content or skill in new situation.
In the ﬁ rst phase the teacher creates the mind set for 
learning. A stimulating introduction helps students 
focus their attention on the concept being explored. 
Teachers have many ways of creating an expectancy 
or anticipation for learning: a children’s literature 
book on a concept, a manipulative for modeling, or 
a problem situation related to the concept being de-
veloped. A mystery box might contain something re-
lated to the lesson, and students guess the contents; 
for example, an orange in the mystery box might 
introduce spheres. A recent newspaper headline or 
personal experience might pique student interest in 
a new topic. A number puzzle gets students think-
ing about mathematics. These activities motivate 
students to shift their attention from a previous ac-
tivity, such as recess or reading, to mathematics and 
activates prior knowledge for the concept or skill be-
ing addressed.
In the second phase of a directed teaching/think-
ing activity, students develop understanding of new 
content. According to Gagne’s plan, the teacher ex-
plains and models the new content or skill and the 
student models what the teacher has done. How-
ever, a more constructivist approach, described 
in Chapter 4, places the teacher as a facilitator of 
student learning. In this role the teacher prepares a 
problem or situation that engages students’ thinking 
about an important mathematical concept or skill. 
Rather than tell the students what to do and think, 
the teacher asks questions and elicits student ideas. 
The performance task requires the student to think 
mathematically. When children rearrange blocks to 
show regrouping for two-digit addition or roll two 
number cubes and record the results on a graph, 
the activity itself carries the content. Students learn 
by doing mathematics. In this way the critical attri-
butes of the concept are developed by the learner. 
As the activity progresses, the teacher labels the ac-
tions with more formal vocabulary and introduces 
symbols as they are needed.
As teachers check for understanding, they dis-
cover that some students need more explanation 
and examples, whereas others are ready for guided 
practice. During guided practice, students work in 
pairs or independently on problems that extend 
their thinking and skill. The teacher monitors student 
work and gives corrective feedback or guiding ques-
tions as needed. As students progress, the teacher 
asks students to generate their own problems. Stu-
dents who show understanding of the concept or 
skill are ready for the third phase; others need more 
time and examples.
In the third phase of the directed teaching/think-
ing lesson the teacher still monitors student work but 
the student works more independently. Independent 
practice is appropriate when students understand 

 
Chapter 5 Organizing Effective Instruction 
65
the skill or content (Figure 5.8). Students may also 
practice and extend their new concepts and skills 
through problems, projects, and investigations.
E X E RC I S E
The lesson cycle in Figure 5.8 is often called the 
Hunter lesson model, named for educator Madeline 
Hunter, who popularized it. Discuss the lesson cycle 
with a classmate, and compare it to Gagne’s events 
of instruction. •••
Writing Plans for Directed Teaching/Thinking 
Lessons. When writing lesson plans, teachers re-
alize that all activities support the core concept of 
the unit. Whether called the focus, the big idea, or 
E
the essential question, teachers and students con-
nect each day with the unit goals. Without focus on 
the central concept, individual lessons become dis-
jointed. The NCTM standards and expectations help 
teachers ﬁ nd the central ideas for planning.
Lesson plans can be written in many formats, but 
they typically include four or ﬁ ve common elements: 
instructional objectives; step-by-step procedures for 
introducing, guiding, and generalizing the concept 
or skill; materials needed; evaluation techniques; 
and modiﬁ cations for special learners. The blank 
lesson plan format in Figure 5.9 is based on the 
lesson cycle; a sample lesson plan is shown in Fig-
ure 5.10. In Chapters 8 through 16 lesson plans and 
activities for each content standard are presented.

elementary mathematics textbooks. Find three les-
son plans on the Internet and determine how well 
they match the lesson plan format in Figure 5.9. 
What is similar and what is different? •••
Problem-Based Projects 
and Investigations
Another instructional approach is problem-based 
projects or investigations. While investigating a 
problem, students explore and apply concepts and 
skills, expand ideas, and draw conclusions. Investi-
gations can be initiated by the teacher or by students 
E
with the teacher providing technical assistance and 
support. Sometimes, students may require speciﬁ c 
instruction on a mathematics concept related to 
their problem.
Investigation or projects reﬂ ect classroom or real-
world situations. In Ms. Hale’s ﬁ fth-grade class pass-
ing trains were visible from the classroom window. 
One student kept a log of the trains and their sched-
ules on the north and south routes. With encourage-
ment the student researched the trains and discov-
ered coal was the cargo, where the coal was coming 
from and where it was going, the speed of the train, 
and how scheduling prevented train wrecks. A re-
tired train engineer served as a resource person for 
the project. The culmination of the investigation was 
a paper, posters, and a presentation to classmates. A

Instructional Objective: Students will solve story problems using subtraction of 3-digit numerals by 
modeling decomposition with manipulatives and recording the regrouping.
Materials: Have students prepare 3  5 cards in learning center in packs of 100s, 10s, and 1s with rubber 
bands. Distribute 1000 3  5 cards for each group of 4, so that each group has some of each amount.
Procedure: Motivation and preparation: Setting the stage
•  Review place value with dice game, placing numerals to make the largest 4-digit number.
•  Model several subtraction stories with two digit numbers.
•  Tell stories to match the numbers in the problems. Students may use the 100s chart to ﬁnd the 
answers

•  Introduce the regrouping and renaming subtraction model with packs of cards and have students 
follow. “You had 37 cents and spent 22 cents on a pencil.”
•  Put 3 packs of 10 and 7 single cards on the board tray. Remove 22 of them. Ask how many are still 
on the tray.
•  Model several other problems.
•  Compare the answers to answers using the 100s chart.
•  When students demonstrate understanding of regrouping, tell a story with larger numbers: “In 
January, Mrs. Cardwell ordered 1000 Valentine cards for her card shop. On Monday, February 1, she 
still had 862 cards for sale. By Friday, February 5, she only had 374 cards on the shelf. How many had 
she sold during the week?”
Instructional input and modeling
•  Ask students to show how many cards she had at the start with the card sets.
•  Ask students to remove enough cards to show what she had on Monday using regrouping.
•  Then ask them to show how many cards she sold during the week.

•  After a few minutes, ask groups to share their solutions and process.
•  If students used subtraction processes other than decomposition, such as equal addition or 
compensation, accept these solutions and have students discuss different approaches.

•  Provide several more problems.
•  Ask students to tell a story for each subtraction example and model it with cards. They also may use 
one of the other processes to see if they get the same answer.

•  Ask students who are modeling accurately to make up several more problems together.
•  For students who are showing difﬁculty, plan a small-group reteach. Students who are catching on 
can pick three problems from page 93 to work. Go back and review simple subtraction.

teacher who is aware of student interests can make 
time for such projects. Other students might be in-
terested in horses, dinosaurs, or astronauts, which 
could generate investigations that lead to mathemati-
cal questions and concepts as well as interdisciplin-
ary ideas.
•  How fast can different horses run?
•  How big were dinosaurs? How much did they eat?
•  How fast does the shuttle ﬂ y when taking off and 
while in orbit?
Classroom projects provide investigation opportuni-
ties. Ms. Shivey asked ﬁ rst-graders to design board 
games for practicing addition and subtraction facts. 
They played commercial board games to become 
familiar with game structure. Using poster board, 
dice, index cards, and colored pens, they designed 
and constructed games, played their game with 
peers, and revised the game. A two-week creative 
project resulted in many weeks of fact practice as 
well as problem solving, communicating, and rea-
soning. Although penalties were favorite design fea-
tures, the ﬁ rst-graders learned quickly that nobody 
wanted to play games that were impossible to win.
Newspapers are sources of problem-based proj-
ects. When the newspaper reported that a new 
area code was needed, students wanted to know 
why. They discovered that telephone companies re-
served thousands of telephone numbers for future 
use by new subscribers and for new technologies, 
such as cell phones and fax machines. This inves-
tigation led to population statistics and work with 
large numbers. Another article showed how far dif-
ferent animals could jump compared to their body 
length: ﬂ eas, rabbits, kangaroos, and the best hu-
man jumpers. Interest in jumping animals led to in-
terest in world records and then led to activities in 
linear measurement.
Because investigations are open-ended, student 
success is based on whether they complete their task 
and demonstrate the target knowledge and skill. As-
sessment reﬂ ects the learning goal, the choice of 
suitable sources of information, the completeness 
and accuracy of information, and the manner in 
which it is summarized and reported. Many teach-
ers use a K-W-H-L chart for organizing investiga-
tions. Students list what they know, what they want 
to know, and how they are going to conduct the in-
vestigation (including resources they will use) and 
ﬁ nally report on what was learned. Investigations 
provide curriculum differentiation for gifted and tal-
ented students; however, all students beneﬁ t from 
an investigation approach. Some students complete 
several investigations in a year; others may work 
on only one or two. Investigations on different top-
ics can go on simultaneously. Although curriculum 
goals are established by standards, problem-based 
investigations provide a way that students can push 
the curriculum. Providing time and support for 
project-based learning stimulates students to be in-
dependent learners.
Integrating Multiple Approaches
Because children learn mathematics in many ways, 
as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, teachers must 
teach using various approaches. When teachers vary 
their instruction with informal activities, directed 
teaching/thinking lessons, and investigations, they 
provide for students who have different learning 
strengths and needs. Within a unit, teachers want 
to balance exploratory, teacher-guided, and project-
type activities.
Each instructional approach invites children to 
construct mathematical knowledge and to develop 
skills. Informal experiences build background and 
provide practice and maintenance of skills. Directed 
teaching/thinking lessons provide engagement and 
interaction as teachers and students develop con-
cepts, skills, and vocabulary. Investigations allow 
students to pursue mathematical and interdisciplin-
ary projects beyond the predetermined curriculum. 
Individual students may need speciﬁ c modiﬁ cations 
based on their individual plans, but many times ac-
commodations that work for one student can also 
help other students.

The success of each instructional approach is inﬂ u-
enced by other decisions that teachers make about 
mathematics instruction and its delivery. New and 
experienced teachers ask questions about the 
amount and types of practice and homework they 
should assign. They also make decisions about how 
to organize students for instruction. In addition, they 
encourage mathematical conversations by the type 

 
Chapter 5 Organizing Effective Instruction 
69
of questions they ask. Decisions on these topics in-
ﬂ uence how they teach and the learning environ-
ment they create.
Practice
Practice is often equated with intense, isolated drills 
of number facts. In a constructive classroom, prac-
tice has a broader meaning. Practice in a construc-
tivist sense means having many rich and stimulating 
experiences with a concept or skill rather than rep-
etition of the same experience. The concept of area 
is developed when students measure various sur-
faces using tiles, cards, or sticky notes of different 
sizes. Understanding of area measurement is not ex-
pected to be a one-time event but an accumulation 
of related experiences. Informal games and learn-
ing center activities provide multiple experiences in 
learning. The trading game described in Chapters 9 
and 10 helps students at different levels come to new 
understandings of how numbers work.
Guided and independent practice built into di-
rected teaching/thinking lessons allows the teacher 
to observe and question students during learning. By 
assessing students, teachers decide whether some 
need additional developmental work and which 
ones are ready for independent practice or projects. 
Only after students have demonstrated understand-
ing of concepts and proﬁ ciency is independent prac-
tice appropriate. Unless students are 70–80% proﬁ -
cient, practice may reinforce incorrect thinking. If 
sufﬁ cient time is spent on conceptual development 
with a variety of activities and teaching approaches, 
students build strong understanding, which reduces 
time and energy spent with practice.
When students understand number operations 
and develop strategies for learning facts, most are 
successful with fact practice. Without understand-
ing or strategies, however, most ﬁ nd fact practice 
frustrating and defeating. Timed drills are cited as a 
major source of mathematics anxiety. By following 
some simple guidelines, teachers can avoid harmful 
aspects of drill:
•  Develop concepts and skills before independent 
practice is started.
•  Emphasize understanding and accuracy as the 
most important outcome. Speed is a secondary 
goal and varies from student to student.
•  Keep practice sessions short, perhaps 5 minutes.
•  Use a variety of practice activities, including 
games, ﬂ ash cards, and computer programs.
•  Avoid comparison of students. The time re -
quired to master the facts differs from student to 
student.
•  Allow children to monitor their own progress and 
record their improvement.
Homework
Homework seems like a rather simple issue, but 
homework practices are often complicated by is-
sues such as the age of the child, the demands of the 
content, and the support and expectations of par-
ents. Schools may adopt formal policies about the 
nature and amount of homework at different grade 
levels to provide some consistency in practice, but 
many homework policies are unwritten. New teach-
ers should ask about the homework policies in a 
school.
Homework activities are usually of two types: ex-
ploratory or conceptual activities and independent 
practice of skills. At-home exploratory or concep-
tual activities connect school mathematics to home 
and back. Kindergartners might bring an object or 
picture that is “round” or “square” from home. Third-
graders can ﬁ nd how far they travel from home to 
school on the bus, in the car, or by walking. Sixth-
graders could look at the calories on food pack-
ages and create menus using a balanced food plan. 
Teachers also develop take-home backpacks with 
mathematics games, puzzles, or books to stimulate 
exploratory or practice activities.
Independent practice or drill activities often 
come from worksheets or textbook pages. Students 
should understand what they are to do so that they 
can complete the sheet with little assistance. Par-
ents complain when students do not know what to 
do and when the homework takes too long to com-
plete. More is not better. If students understand and 
are successful, 10 to 20 examples are sufﬁ cient. If 
students cannot complete 10 or 20 examples, assign-
ing 50 or 100 creates frustration for students and par-
ents. Some teachers set a time limit on homework, 
such as “work as many examples as you can in 10 
minutes.”
Responding to homework is another issue with 
many different opinions. Some teachers insist on 
grading homework, while others check for accuracy 

70 
Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
and understanding. By removing the emphasis on 
grading, teachers and students look at homework 
differently. Students who check their own home -
work can see what they got right and wrong. Self-
assessment allows them to ﬁ nd out what they 
understand. With a quick check of homework, 
teachers identify strengths and weaknesses of 
the class or individuals. A mistake on homework 
or seat work provides an opportunity to correct a 
misunderstanding.
Grouping
Flexible grouping means that the teacher uses dif-
ferent instructional groups appropriate to the task or 
situation. Students can work independently, in small 
groups, or in the whole-class setting. Groups are not 
ﬁ xed but are reorganized periodically so children 
can work with a variety of peers on different tasks. 
Each grouping format has advantages and disadvan-
tages. Students working alone gain independence 
but miss the opportunity to discuss, explain, and 
justify their work with peers. Whole-class instruc-
tion seems efﬁ cient because all the students appear 
to be learning the same thing, but individuals may 
not be engaged with the group task at all. When 
whole-group instruction is the only instructional 
format, some students are unchallenged and bored 
while other students are lost. Small groups of three 
to six students have many instructional advantages. 
Students of similar abilities or interests can work to-
gether for a unit or project.
Flexible grouping avoids 
the dangers of tracking, 
or grouping students by 
ability and keeping stu-
dents together for long pe-
riods. Tracking frequently 
works to the detriment of 
lower-ability students, with 
instruction that deempha-
sizes concepts and over-
emphasizes isolated skills. 
Tracking 
also 
isolates 
the lower-ability students 
from the modeling and 
support of more proﬁ cient 
students. The lower-track 
students often have the 
least qualiﬁ ed and least 
experienced teachers and the least opportunity to 
experience a full and balanced curriculum.
The equity principle advocates a balanced, stim-
ulating curriculum for all students. When children 
have the opportunity to work together to learn and 
solve problems, all are advantaged. Using multiple 
instructional approaches increases interest in learn-
ing with lessons that draw on students’ background 
experiences. Informal activities and projects in-
crease enrichment of the curriculum, greater per-
sonalization of instruction, and student interaction 
and discussion.
Cooperative Group Learning
Cooperative learning is a grouping strategy that is 
designed to increase student participation by capi-
talizing on the social aspects of learning. In math-
ematics, students cooperate while working together 
on a geometry puzzle, measuring the playground, 
or reviewing for a test. Spencer Kagan (1994) identi-
ﬁ ed basic principles for implementing cooperative 
learning successfully: positive interdependence, in-
dividual accountability, equal participation, and si-
multaneous interaction. Positive interdependence
means that team success is achieved through the 
successes and contributions of each member. In-
dividual accountability requires that team mem-
bers be held accountable for contributions and re-
sults of the team effort. Every student on the team is 
responsible for learning the content and skill, and 
the team is accountable for all the team members’ 
being successful. Equal participation means that 
team members have equal opportunity to partici-
pate; an activity is not dominated by one member, 
nor can members choose not to participate. In tra-
ditional instruction, interchanges are often between 
the teacher and one student at a time. Coopera-
tive learning involves several students at the same 
time—simultaneous interaction.
In cooperative learning students are organized in 
groups, or teams, that are heterogeneous so that stu-
dents with different skill levels, ethnic and cultural 
backgrounds, socioeconomic status, and other char-
acteristics work together. English-language learners 
work with bilingual students or English speakers. 
Teachers balance teams with higher-, middle-, and 
lower-skill students. Simpler, shorter mathematics 
tasks, such as covering the desk with tiles or play-
ing a game on addition facts, may be done in pairs. 

 
Chapter 5 Organizing Effective Instruction 
71
Cooperative-learning activities may be done with 
two to six students, but many teachers prefer teams 
of four because they are small enough for active par-
ticipation by everyone and large enough for diver-
sity of members and roles. Larger teams result in stu-
dents’ withdrawing from tasks and observing rather 
than participating. Many teachers assign speciﬁ c 
roles within the teams, such as recorder, reporter, 
materials manager, teacher contact, and convener. 
Students rotate roles so they all gain social and or-
ganizational skills.
Team building and cooperative skills are also es-
sential to cooperative learning. Team members bond 
by sharing who they are, where they have been, and 
what they aspire to become. Choosing a team name, 
designing an insignia, or creating a motto encour-
ages team pride and identity. Students learn about 
each other and appreciate the skills and experience 
each one brings to the task. Interpersonal skills are 
developed through cooperation with teammates. 
Students learn to participate actively and equally, 
to share and rotate responsibilities, and to report 
results of group activities. An effective teacher pro-
motes cooperative skills by modeling them, select-
ing students to role-play for practice, and holding 
discussions and evaluations of cooperative efforts.
Kagan (at http://www.cooperativelearning.com) de-
scribes 20 cooperative learning structures for dif-
ferent purposes from complex to simple tasks. Stu-
dents unfamiliar with cooperative learning begin 
with simple activities and structures for a speciﬁ c 
task for a short time. In Pairs/Check two students 
solve problems, check each other, and correct each 
other if needed. For Think/Pair/Share individuals 
work individually on a problem or task, then discuss 
their results with a partner, and ﬁ nally share with 
all members of the team to see if all team members 
understand the content or process.
A cooperative structure of intermediate com-
plexity is Numbered Heads Together. When a learn-
ing task and objective is presented, each team is 
responsible for all members’ mastering the content 
or skill. The teacher calls on team members by num-
ber. If the team member answers a question or dem-
onstrates a skill, the team earns points. In Jigsaw 
students leave their home team to become part of 
an expert group. Each team member becomes an 
“expert” on one aspect of the content or skill and 
teaches the home team (Figure 5.11). If the topic is 
angles, students become experts on acute angles, 
right angles, obtuse angles, and measuring angles. 
When all parts of the content come together, stu-
dents gain a complete understanding of angles. 
Jigsaw places responsibility on each team member 
to contribute to the overall completion of a divided 
task, story, or chapter.
Students learning English beneﬁ t from coopera-
tive learning because they use and hear English in 
a less threatening context than whole-class discus-
sions. Cooperative groups accommodate students 
with learning disabilities as well as gifted and tal-
ented students. Students with learning disabilities 
beneﬁ t from interaction with other students. Stu-
dents proﬁ cient in mathematics extend their un-
derstanding when they teach others and exchange 
ideas with team partners. For students with limited 
mathematics proﬁ ciency, group cooperation sup-
ports their learning.
Cooperative learning also beneﬁ ts students from 
different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Lee Little 
Soldier (1989) says that cooperative learning sup-
ports the Native American value of learning based 
on cooperation rather than competition. She notes 
that “traditional Indian families encourage children 
to develop independence, to make wise decisions, 
and to abide by them. Thus the locus of control of 
Indian children is internal, rather than external, and 
they are not accustomed to viewing adults as authori-
ties who impose their will on others” (pp. 162–163).

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Carol Malloy (1997), in a discussion of African 
American students and mathematics, observes, “In-
structional models that permit students to partici-
pate in cooperative rather than competitive learn-
ing activities will allow students to take advantage of 
their community focus and interdependence as well 
as their preference for learning through social and 
affective emphases” (p. 29). The structure of coop-
erative groups means that all students have opportu-
nities to participate, make contributions, and share 
the results of their work. Instead of every person for 
him- or herself, cooperative learning is based on the 
Three Musketeers philosophy of one for all, and all 
for one. The group succeeds only when all the part-
ners succeed.
Cooperative learning has been the subject of 
research for more than 30 years. Research and re-
views of the literature about cooperative learning by 
Slavin (1987, 1989) attest to its beneﬁ ts for student 
achievement. Of 68 studies on cooperative learning 
that were judged to be adequately controlled, 72% 
showed higher achievement for cooperative-learn-
ing groups. Cooperative approaches are effective 
over a range of achievement measures and different 
students; the more complex the outcomes (higher-
order processing of information, problem solving), 
the greater the effects. Marzano and colleagues 
(2003), in an extensive review of research on in-
structional strategies, found that cooperative learn-
ing was highly effective in raising student achieve-
ment an average of 30 percentile (Marzano, 2003).
Encouraging Mathematical 
Conversations
Teachers encourage or discourage talk and thinking 
with the questions they ask children. While watching 
informal activities, checking for understanding in a 
lesson, or guiding an investigation, teachers need 
to ask more open-ended questions. Open-ended 
questions ask students to explain their reasoning. 
Closed questions call for short, speciﬁ c answers.
Closed Questions 
Open-Ended Questions

or less than Cereal y? 
or Cereal y? Why?
What is the formula for  
Given this triangle, how 
the area of this triangle? 
 could you determine its 
area? Is there more than 
one way to show it?
Asking good questions is an important teaching skill 
to develop. Without preparation, teachers tend to 
ask questions that have short, factual answers. Good 
questions challenge students to think at a deeper 
level. The teacher can write several open-ended 
questions in a lesson to elicit student understand-
ing and misconceptions. After asking higher level 
questions, teachers should also allow enough time, 
called wait time, so that one or more students can 
respond and engage in discussion.
Managing the Instructional 
Environment
Managing the instructional environment also inﬂ u-
ences instruction. Teacher decisions about the time, 
space, materials, textbooks, and other resources for 
teaching can encourage or discourage student in-
teraction and increase or decrease independence 
and responsibility of children managing their own 
learning.
Time
Teachers seldom say that they have too much time 
for teaching. Careful planning helps teachers maxi-
mize engaged learning time for active learning. 
Long-range planning helps teachers balance topics 
throughout the year. Standards have a scope and 
sequence of content and process, but teachers allo-
cate time for introduction, development, and main-
tenance of concepts and skills throughout the year. 
Teachers also balance time for mathematics with 
other subjects. If mathematics is scheduled for 1 hour 
daily, the teacher has about 180 hours to develop 
knowledge and skills. Every minute is precious.
Teachers maximize time by integrating math-
ematics with different subjects. Measuring tempera-
ture or mass addresses science and mathematics 
standards. A graphing lesson that compares state 
or country populations includes mathematics skills 
and social studies content. Interdisciplinary plan-
ning means instructional time does double duty
If mathematics lasts 50 minutes or an hour, an 
effective teacher maximizes student engaged time 
with a variety of activities by using a parallel sched-
ule (Figure 5.12). Some students participate in di-
rected lessons while others work in learning centers, 
on projects, on the computer, or on seat work. The 
teacher teaches a whole-group lesson, reteaches 
with a small group, assesses individuals, and moni-

tors student work during the period. The teacher pro-
vides closure to the math period by reviewing major 
points and discussing issues and questions raised 
by students. Offering a variety of different learning 
activities is important whether teachers plan a ﬁ xed 
mathematics period, an integrated day, or a parallel-
activity schedule.
Space
How teachers organize space in the classroom also 
inﬂ uences the classroom climate. A classroom with 
desks lined up in rows with the teacher’s desk in 
front implies a teacher-centered approach. If desks 
are arranged in groups of four or tables with centers 
and materials displayed around the room, the room 
invites more student interaction (Figure 5.13). Even 
if student desks are in rows, teachers may allow stu-
dents to move their desks together for activities or to 
work together on the ﬂ oor or at a table. Changing the 
room arrangement is natural as children progress 
and new topics are introduced. Displaying student 
work on bulletin boards also reinforces the topics 
being studied. Students can post samples of work 
or alternative answers to problems. Then the bulle-
tin board contributes to discussion of mathematics 
concepts and ideas.
Learning Centers
Learning centers are areas in the classroom set 
up with materials that students can use in their 
learning. With learning centers students engage in 
informal or exploratory work, review and maintain

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
prior skills, and conduct problem-based investiga-
tions. Students can work independently and/or have 
speciﬁ c tasks that are required. Some learning cen-
ters contain a variety of manipulatives that can be 
used every day in mathematics instruction: calcu-
lators; games, puzzles, and books; paper, crayons, 
and marking pens. Other centers support speciﬁ c 
instructional objectives. For studying geometry, the 
center might include geometry puzzles, geoboards, 
tangrams, and pattern blocks.
•  A data center may contain spinners, number 
cubes, a clipboard for data collection, and a com-
puter for entering data, analyzing, and displaying 
graphs.
•  A sand or water tub with plastic containers of 
various sizes and units provides exploration of 
volume and capacity.
•  A game center includes games and puzzles for 
developing strategy, practicing number facts, or 
learning geometry terms.
•  Computers are set up with software selected to 
support the instructional goal or maintain skills 
from earlier units.
•  A classroom store may be adapted to different 
instructional purposes. Play money and empty 
product boxes are all that primary-grade children 
need to play store while they learn about the 
exchange of money for goods. Third- and fourth-
graders pay and make change, practicing subtrac-
tion skills. Fifth- or sixth-graders can set up a real 
store in which students buy school pencils or 
notebooks and keep records of the proﬁ t and loss 
in the store.
Task cards or other assignment options in the learn-
ing center encourage independent work. For prob-
ability the assignment shown in Figure 5.14 might be 
posted. The task card for measurement illustrated in 
Figure 5.15 guides students’ measurement activities 
with a centimeter ruler. Advance planning and se-
lection of materials is essential for implementation 
of learning centers, but because they do not require 
constant supervision by the teacher, the teacher 
can be engaged in other instructional or assess-
ment tasks. However, rotating and updating materi-
als in the center is important because new options 
increase students’ interest.
Manipulatives
Manipulatives, sometimes called objects to think 
with, include a variety of objects—for example, 
blocks, scales, coins, rulers, puzzles, and contain-
ers. Stones or sticks were probably the ﬁ rst manipu-
latives used; today the choice of materials seems 
endless, with educational catalogs full of materials 
that support mathematical thinking (see Appendix 
B). Manipulatives can be as simple as folding paper 
to demonstrate fractional parts or as elaborate as a 
classroom kit of place-value blocks. The value of a 
manipulative is in its use. Skilled teachers help stu-
dents discover mathematics embedded in the mate-
rials. Matching the manipulatives to the concept or 
operation being taught is the key for using them to 
scaffold students’ understanding.
Exploring Probability
Each group is to select one probablility device: spinner, die, or coin. Follow the directions and 
record the number of times for each result.
■  If you choose a spinner, spin it 50 times and count how many times the pointer stops at 
each color.
■  If you select a die, roll it 50 times and count how many times each number lands on top.
■  If you have a coin, toss it 50 times and record the number of heads and tails.
When you have completed the task, discuss the results, make a table or graph showing the 
results, and write a statement that tells what you have observed. Was this the result you 
expected, or did it surprise you?
This activity should take about 15 minutes. You may repeat this assignment three times 
with different probability devices. Place the results of your experiment, with conclusions, in 
your folder.
Figure 5.14 
Probability assignment for

Chapter 5 Organizing Effective Instruction 
75
Manipulatives can be packaged for easy dis-
tribution and compact storage. Plastic shoeboxes 
and zip bags are often used for these reasons. Be-
cause schools cannot buy every manipulative for 
every teacher; sharing resources is essential. With 
a central mathematics storage area for the school 
or grade level, teachers can check out materials as 
they teach a topic.
Some people believe that manipulatives are just 
for younger children or for slow learners. However, 
manipulatives support learning of concepts by creat-
ing physical models that become mental models for 
concepts and processes. Many manipulatives can 
be used for several mathematics concepts. Teachers 
need to know what concepts are being developed 
by the manipulative so they can encourage students 
to develop the concept or skill. Table 5.3 shows the 
connection between mathematical concepts with 
appropriate manipulatives.
Textbooks and Other Printed Materials
Although recent textbook series claim to address 
the NCTM and state standards, research shows that 
they are only partially successful. Written to ap-
peal to the widest audience, textbooks include a 
little of everything. Used in a conceptual teaching 
plan, textbooks provide units and lessons with ac-
tivities, games, extension activities, and evaluation 
strategies. Teachers exercise professional judgment 
by determining how well any materials connect to 
standards and learning expectations of the state 
and district. Effective teachers start with the stan-
dards, not the textbook chapters, to balance topic 
coverage of them. Relying on a textbook for a long-
range plan may put too much emphasis on a topic of 
limited value and reduce treatment of other topics. 
Checking the developmental sequence of skills is 
important. One teacher found that measurement to 
the quarter inch was presented before students had 
studied fractional parts. She introduced fractions 
before starting the measurement lesson.
Textbooks and other materials are effective only 
if they serve the learning needs of the students. Even 
when a textbook includes informal and exploratory 
activities to open a lesson, some teachers start with 
sample problems. Whether teachers use the devel-
opmental lesson from the textbook or create their 
own, concept development is essential. Eliminating 
exploratory developmental activities undermines 
children’s understanding of the core concept.
NCTM and many commercial publishers provide 
supplementary materials that support the standards. 
The number of lessons, games, and activities avail-
able on the Internet is almost limitless; however, 
many materials posted on the Internet have not un-
dergone editing or a selection process. Reviewing 
activities is required to match the content and learn-
ing needs of the children. Vendors can also provide 
Using Centimeters
Use the centimeter ruler to measure the items and answer the questions. Use a com-
plete sentence to answer each question. Compare your answers with those of another 
student. If there are any discrepancies, measure the objects again to resolve them.
1.  How many centimeters long is the plastic pen?
2.  How many centimeters long is the yellow spoon?
3.  How many centimeters long is the ﬁlm box? How wide is it? Is the end of the ﬁlm 
box shaped like a square?
4.  How many centimeters long is the strip of blue paper?
5.  What are three things in the room that are less than 20-centimeters long? How long 
is each thing?

menting exciting instruction.
Children’s Literature
Only 20 years ago few children’s books that focused 
on mathematics were available beyond simple 
number books. Now concept books on every math-
ematical topic are a great addition to the materials 
teachers can use for teaching and learning. Books 
introduce concepts in realistic or imaginary set-
tings that stimulate children’s interest and thinking. 
In Chapters 8–20 children’s books on each content 
topic are listed. Bibliographies of children’s books 
organized by concept are available on several Inter-
net sites, with activities to extend the concept.

Summary
Effective teachers actively engage students in meaning-
ful mathematics tasks using a variety of instructional ap-
proaches, including informal and exploratory activities, 
directed teaching/thinking lessons, and projects and 
investigations. Exploratory activities involve students in 
independent work with manipulatives and games and al-
low them to develop an intuitive understanding of con-
cepts through their experiences. In directed teaching/
thinking lessons teachers guide students through a series 
of interactive experiences. Lessons are not lectures and 
are not passive in nature; they require students to engage 
in a problem or situation that requires development of 
mathematics skills and concepts. Projects and investiga-
tions are good extensions of learning that allow students 
to reﬁ ne their understanding and apply skills. Using a va-
riety of instructional approaches allows students with dif-
ferent skills, interests, and needs to be challenged. Unit 
planning, weekly planning, and daily planning provide a 
structure to build concepts in a logical sequence of les-
sons and activities that move from simple to complex, 
concrete to symbolic, and speciﬁ c to generalized.
Teachers confront many issues and make many or-
ganizational and management decisions that inﬂ uence 
the learning environment. Decisions are based on un-
derstanding state and local curriculum standards and 
providing a safe and stimulating environment for learn-
ing. The role and amount of practice and homework are 
practical issues. Homework can consist of conceptual 
or practice activities. Practice should be assigned only 
if students have developed a skill, or else they will be 
frustrated and will practice the skill incorrectly.
Teachers decide whether to teach large groups, small 
groups, or individuals, depending on the needs of stu-
dents on a speciﬁ c lesson. Cooperative-learning groups 
require students to work together to complete tasks and 
master content. Cooperative learning beneﬁ ts students 
with learning disabilities, gifted and talented students, 
ethnic and cross-cultural groups, and English-language 
learners because all students are supported in a positive 
social climate focused on learning.
Decisions regarding grouping and teaching strategies 
connect to classroom decisions about time allocation, 
space arrangements, and choice of materials. Because 
teachers have limited time, careful scheduling is required 
to provide time for different instructional approaches, 
activities, and groupings. Flexible seating arrangements 
encourage group cooperation and sharing. Learning 
centers contain learning materials and assignments for 
investigations, projects, and independent tasks. Manip-
ulatives are an essential part of teaching mathematics 
because they help students develop physical models 
to represent mathematics operations. All students need 
the beneﬁ ts of manipulatives in learning mathematics. 
Textbooks can be valuable resources when teachers use 
them to support developmental learning. They contain 
lessons using manipulatives and provide many sugges-
tions for games and enrichment. Teachers must review 
textbooks and other resource materials carefully to make 
sure they support the scope and sequence of their curric-
ulum. Children’s literature that addresses mathematical 
concepts is available for all topics. Children’s literature 
helps students relate mathematics to real or imagined 
situations. Lists of books and lesson plans are available 
on the Internet.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Select one performance objective from your state or 
district objectives. Find a lesson plan on the Internet 
that might be used to teach the objective. Does the 
lesson plan include all the parts of the model lesson 
plan?

 2.  Observe a mathematics lesson. Did the teacher’s les-
son ﬁ t the lesson cycle or the model lesson plan?
 3.  Interview a teacher who uses cooperative learning. 
Ask how activities are organized. Are any structures 
that are described in this textbook used in the class? 
If you cannot ﬁ nd a teacher who uses cooperative 
learning, ask if they have ever used cooperative 
learning and what they found were the strengths 
and weaknesses of cooperative learning.
 4.  Observe two classrooms and note how each teacher 
organizes the classroom. Consider student grouping, 
classroom arrangement, use of time, and availability 
of resources for student learning. How do the class-
rooms compare to the suggestions in this textbook?
 5.  Examine the teacher’s manual from a recent el-
ementary mathematics series. Is the book aligned 
with your state or district objectives? Do the lessons 
specify the performance objectives for each lesson? 
Are concepts adequately developed with activities 
and manipulatives before guided and independent 
activities are introduced? Are supplemental games 
and activities suggested? Is this a textbook you 
would like to use in your teaching? Why or why not? 
If you know a teacher who uses the textbook, ask for 
a response to the textbook.

Part 1 Guiding Elementary 

The Role of 
Technology in 
the Mathematics 
Classroom
he boundaries of mathematics education are moving, never 
to return to their former positions. New and emerg-
ing technologies are expanding how children learn 
mathematics and how teachers teach mathematics. 
Technological advances in mathematics are nothing new. 
Past technological advances, including the abacus (500 B.C.E.–1000 C.E.), 
the slide rule (c. 1600), and the pencil (c. 1800), had lasting effects on how 
mathematics was discovered, taught, and learned. The inﬂ uence of these 
inventions pales in comparison to the technological advances of the 
20th century. The inventions of the calculator, the computer, and the Internet 
promise to change mathematics learning to a far greater degree than 
the earlier inventions and will continue to do so, perhaps in ways we can 
not imagine.
 
NCTM included a technology principle in 
The Principles and Standards for School Mathemat-
ics (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 
2000). The technology principle states (p. 24):
 
 Technology is essential in teaching and learn-
ing mathematics; it inﬂ uences the mathematics 
that is taught and enhances students’ learning.

CHAPTER 6

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Calculators
Calculator use in the mathematics classroom has 
sparked more controversy than any other techno-
logical development. Opponents of calculators in 
the classroom fear the erosion of students’ skills, 
their diminished memory of basic facts, and their 
inability to perform mental math or make everyday 
estimations. Such concerns are not unreasonable, 
and many parents share these concerns. Teachers 
can help parents allay these concerns and develop 
a more positive attitude toward calculators in the 
classroom (see Hillman & Malotka, 2004). To be 
sure, calculators in the hands of students without 
any guidance is not necessarily a good thing. How-
ever, appropriate use of calculators can enhance 
students’ ability to perform mathematics.
NCTM has taken the following position (National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2005):
School mathematics programs should 
provide students with a range of knowledge, 
skills, and tools. Students need an under-
standing of number and operations, includ-
ing the use of computational procedures, 
estimation, mental mathematics, and the ap-
propriate use of the calculator. A balanced 
mathematics program develops students’ 
conﬁ dence and understanding of when and 
how to use these skills and tools. Students 
need to develop their basic mathematical 
understandings to solve problems both in 
and out of school.
Calculator Use
Calculators are neither the cure-all for learning 
mathematics nor the end of learning basic facts and 
algorithms. The calculator is a tool that, if properly 
used in the classroom, augments understanding of 
numbers and operations. But it is not a substitute 
for understanding an algorithm process or know-
ing basic number facts. A ﬁ fth-grade student who 
reaches for a calculator to determine 7  6 is not 
making suitable use of this tool, neither is a fourth 
grader who needs a calculator to decide if $5.00 is 
sufﬁ cient to purchase two items that cost $1.99 each. 
In contrast, a suitable use of a calculator might be to 
determine average daily high and low temperatures 
for a given time period.
These examples highlight the balance a class-
room teacher must provide when calculators are 
used in the classroom. Sometimes mental math-
ematics should be used, whether recalling a num-
ber fact or solving 82  5 by mentally reforming 
the problem to (80  5)  (2  5). In many cases 
mathematics problems and settings require estima-
tion skills, as with the problem of purchases with $5 
suggested earlier. Of course, there are times when a 
problem involves complex numbers and repetitious 
computations or when an exact answer is required. 
In these cases the calculator is the right tool.
Depending on the problem, however, computing 
an exact answer by mental math or paper and pen-
cil can be faster than using a calculator. The follow-
ing problems demonstrate how number sense can 
be more efﬁ cient than competent calculator use.
As the technology principle suggests, the calculator, computer, and the In-
ternet are no longer extravagant frills or add-ons. They are now essential for 
teaching and learning mathematics in the 21st century.

When students have many experiences with 
problems that use mental math, estimation, pen-
cil-and-paper computations, and calculations with 
a calculator, they develop the ability to discern the 
judicious use of a calculator while developing es-
timation and mental math skills. Teachers need to 
help students develop a sense about these types of 
mathematics solution strategies so students do not 
unnecessarily rely on a calculator to solve every 
mathematics problem.
Appropriate calculator use must be considered 
even with complex problems that require a speciﬁ c 
answer. The objective of the problem itself can help 
determine if using a calculator is called for. If the 
objective of a problem is process oriented, then 
children can beneﬁ t from pencil-and-paper com-
putation, using algorithms they have learned. A 
process-oriented problem concentrates students’ 
efforts on getting the answer by using familiar al-
gorithms. The method, or the process, is the focus. 
Such problems enable students to apply their algo-
rithms in real-life situations and to appreciate how 
empowering such algorithms are, in contrast to ster-
ile rote computations performed from a set of skill 
problems on a worksheet. Students might use their 
knowledge of multiplication to determine the area of 
their classroom in square feet and in square inches. 
If the objective of the problem is product oriented, 
then the focus is on the product students obtain to 
solve a problem. The calculator frees students from 
computational boredom and allows them to concen-
trate on the product or the answer. They can think 
about the problem itself and not on the computa-
tions that the problem requires. For example, a cal-
culator would be a proper tool to use when ﬁ nding 
the mean age in years and days of a classroom of 
students. Naturally many problems have elements of 
both process and product orientations, but usually 
one of them dominates the problem, as suggested 
by the problems here.
Beneﬁ ts of Using a Calculator
Calculators can be used to enhance children’s un-
derstanding of mathematics. Consider the following 
problem:
•  Use each of the digits 4–9 only once to form two 
three-digit numbers with the largest product 
possible.
This problem is tedious to explore using pencil and 
paper to perform the computations. In fact, such a 
problem might not even be appropriate for pencil 
and paper. The problem requires too much time 
and effort to solve using a pencil. Using a calculator 
frees students from the time-consuming drudgery of 
computation and allows them to discover patterns 
and relationships about the multiplication algo-
rithm that they use to produce the largest possible 
product.
The 
calculator 
can 
also help students explore 
mathematics concepts for 
the ﬁ rst time. Imagine a 
child entering 21.34679 
into a calculator and then 
multiplying by 10 repeat-
edly. The child then ob-
serves how the decimal 
point changes positions 
as each multiplication by 10 is entered. The calcu-
lator becomes a tool for understanding multiplica-
tion with powers of 10. Similarly, the child could 
enter a decimal fraction and then repeatedly di-
vide by 10. Young children can enter a digit (say, 5), 
then press , then . The result will be 10. Press 
 again and the result is 15, and so forth. Children 
can produce the multiples of any number this way 
and thus can learn to skip 
count using the calculator.
 Newer calculators al-
low students to enter and 
display common fractions 
and mixed numbers. A 
student who enters 1

may be surprised to see 
the answer 2
5 displayed 
rather than

puted incorrectly by 
adding the numerators 
and the de nomi na -

process with several 
more pairs of frac-
tions will help the stu-
dent anticipate a different

numerators and denominators.

discern. How did using a calculator help you? •••
As a practical condi-
tion when using calcula-
tors in the classroom, 
each student or each 
pair of students needs 
a calculator. In pri-
mary grades children 
may bring a calcu-
lator from home. 
Although all cal-
culators follow the 
same logic in their 
computational 
operations, differ-
ent manufactur-
ers use different 
color keys and 
displays. 
Different 
models of calcula-
tors include a vari-
ety of operation keys beyond the digits and the four 
major operations (, , , ). These extra keys may 
confuse younger students. When possible, a school 
set of calculators appropriate for the grade level is 
the best choice so that all students are using the 
same calculator in class and from year to year.
Research on Calculators 
in the Classroom
Research has long supported appropriate calcula-
tor use in mathematics classrooms. For example, 
in an early meta-analysis of nongraphing calculator 
studies, the researchers concluded that “the use of 
hand-held calculators improved student learning” 
(Humbree & Dassart, 1994). In addition, students’ 
attitudes toward mathematics also improved.
Subsequent studies have continued to show the 
beneﬁ ts of using calculators in the classroom (Dun-
ham & Dick, 1994; Groves, 1994). A recent synthesis 
E
of 54 research studies on the use of calculators in the 
classroom resulted in several important ﬁ ndings. A 
statistical meta-analysis of the studies showed that 
using calculators in the classroom had a positive 
effect on children’s computational and conceptual 
mathematics development. Using calculators in the 
classroom was also linked with students’ positive 
attitude toward mathematics. Perhaps surprisingly, 
students who used calculators did better on mental 
computation problems than did nonusers (Elling-
ton, 2003).
The 
meta-analysis 
compared 
mathematics 
achievement on standard tests among classes that 
used calculators in different ways. One ﬁ nding was 
that children who used the calculator in the class-
room but not on the test performed up to expec-
tations. These children maintained their pencil-
and-paper skills despite using a calculator in class. 
Another ﬁ nding was that for calculator use to beneﬁ t 
students, the students had to use calculators in their 
classroom for at least 9 weeks. Using calculators for 
shorter periods did not beneﬁ t students, and a few 
studies showed that such short-term use of calcula-
tors actually lowered students’ achievement.
The conclusion of this meta-analysis was that 
“calculators should be carefully integrated into K–2 
classrooms to strengthen the operational goals of 
these grades, as well as foster students’ problem-
solving abilities” (Ellington, 2003, p. 461). Subse-
quent studies have also continued to support the 
beneﬁ t of calculators to students’ mathematics 
learning (Grouws & Cebula, 2004). For more about 
calculator use in the classroom, see http://www.nctm
.org/dialogues/1999-05.pdf.
The subject of calculators in the classroom can 
be particularly worrisome for parents. Some parents 
still fear that their children’s mathematics skills will 
waste away if they regularly use a calculator in math-
ematics. As part of informing parents about their 
children’s education, a letter to parents describing 
how the calculator will be used in class can alleviate 
many parental concerns.
Dear Parent,
We are using calculators in your child’s third-grade class this 
year. The calculator is another learning tool that will help your 
child discover mathematical relationships and learn math-
ematics concepts. We will use the calculator to explore whole 
number patterns and decimal patterns. We will also use the 
calculator to solve problems that would require long and te-

Chapter 6 The Role of Technology in the Mathematics Classroom 
83
Middle school students can use the graphing ca-
pabilities of advanced calculator models for explor-
ing statistical and algebraic concepts, for example, 
using graphing calculators to plot and identify coor-
dinates of points. Students in upper middle school 
grades can use graphing calculators to investigate 
lines on a coordinate plane and the equations that 
produce these lines. These same graphing calcula-
tors can also perform geometry explorations using 
an adapted dynamic geometry software program 
(see Johnson et al., 2004).
Computers
The impact of computer technology on public edu-
cation continues to expand. Almost one-fourth of 
school districts now provide laptop computers for 
their students (Borja, 2006). Some states are consid-
ering a graduation requirement that requires all stu-
dents to pass an online course (Canavale, 2005).
Research About Computers 
in the Classroom
Some concerned educators and commentators fear 
that all the money and efforts being devoted to edu-
cational technology may be misplaced. Critics who 
fear a rush to computer technology frequently cite 
Ted Oppenheimer’s “Computer Delusion” (1997). In 
this article Oppenheimer suggests that “computers 
are lollipops that rot your teeth,” and he terms com-
puters “just a glamorous tool” (pp. 46 and 47).
Learning in the Real World is a group of editors 
and parents who are also concerned about the grow-
ing trend to use computers in education. The con-
cerns of this group are that computer funds might 
be better spent in other areas, that the isolation of 
students who work alone on a computer is not ben-
eﬁ cial, and that the contrast between a virtual world 
and the real thing is lost. In their publications Learn-
ing in the Real World cites journals and newspapers 
around the country to support its position. For ex-
ample, the group quotes the executive director of 
the National Association of Elementary School Prin-
cipals, “If computers make a difference, it has yet 
to show up in achievement” (Learning in the Real 
World, 2000). Such concerns are well meaning and 
should be examined.
Certainly the computer is not a cure-all for ev-
ery problem in education, especially mathemat-
ics. It is not enough to place a few computers in a 
classroom and expect improvement. Improvement 
will not come even if every child has her or his own 
computer. Along with the technology must come 
appropriate use of the computer, effective programs 
that take advantage of the computers, and proper 
training and knowledge by teachers who will use 
the computers in the classroom. When these crite-
ria are met, then computer technology can beneﬁ t 
students. The research is clear: “Students can learn 
more mathematics, more deeply with the appropri-
ate use of technology” (National Council of Teach-
ers of Mathematics, 2000, p. 25).
School districts that 
provided laptops to their 
students have seen grade 
point averages rise without 
any other changes in the 
education program (Borja, 
2006). A study in Missouri 
found that providing one 
Internet-connected com-
puter for every two stu-
dents also improved stu-
dents’ test scores (Beglau, 
2005). Other research ﬁ ndings support improved 
learning and student achievement when students 
use computers. When computer use is combined 
with effective software programs, engaging lessons, 
or the Internet, student achievement becomes clear 
(Anderson, 2000; Clements & Sarama, 2002; Cordes 
& Miller, 2000; Dirr, 2004; Marshall, 2002; North Cen-
tral Regional Education Laboratory, 2005; Schacter, 
1999; Wenglinsky, 1998).
Computer Software
In most cases classroom computers are linked to 
software programs or to the Internet. (We discuss 
the Internet later in this chapter.) In the early days 
of computers in the classroom, computer programs 
were essentially programmed learning tools. At the 
dious computation by hand. We will not use the calculator to 
replace learning mathematics facts or appropriate mathemat-
ics operations.
 
If you have questions about how we are using calculators 
at any time during the school year, ask your child to explain 
how we used calculators that week. If you have other ques-
tions please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely,

end of the session, the student’s score was tabulated 
and this score determined the starting point for the 
next session. From this simple, pedantic start, edu-
cational software has evolved into a wide variety of 
learning tools.
Today the computer allows interactive explora-
tion, discovery, practice, review, and much more. 
Mathematics software products available to teach-
ers and parents run the gamut from simple entertain-
ing games to a complete K–12 mathematics course. 
Research conﬁ rms that these programs can be ef-
fective teaching tools. Similar research supports 
other programs, for example, two dynamic geom-
etry software programs, Geometer’s Sketchpad 
and Cabri Geometry (Battista, 2002). Dynamic ge-
ometry software programs allow students to draw, 
distort, and measure shapes and explore a wide 
range of geometry concepts. These software pro-
grams help children “develop personally meaning -
ful ways of reasoning that enable them to carefully 
analyze spatial problems and situations” (Battista, 
2001, p. 74). Other software programs from various 
commercial vendors are frequently supported by re-
search as well.
Fewer school districts are purchasing stand-alone 
software programs, preferring to use software that is 
bundled in an entire curriculum program (see http://
www.Riverdeep.com) or associated with a mathematics 
textbook adoption. In addition, many teachers have 
found activities on the Internet that duplicate the 
activities of software programs. Nevertheless, the 
number of software programs continues to expand, 
focusing more on home use and less on school use. 
It can be beneﬁ cial to help parents determine what 
software programs they might purchase for their 
children. All programs are not created equal. It is 
important to select an effective mathematics soft-
ware program for the classroom or the home. The 
following criteria may be helpful in selecting soft-
ware programs for mathematics.
•  Is the mathematics content correct?
•  Is the mathematics at the appropriate level?
•  Is the mathematics meaningful?
•  Is the program user-friendly? (Not too dull, but not 
too many bells and whistles)
•  Is the program at an appropriate level?
•  Is the program highly interactive?
•  Is the program engaging for students?
•  Does the program develop mathematics thinking 
or simply drill mathematics facts/procedures?
•  Does the program do what it claims?
•  Does the program require higher-order thinking?
•  Are there printed support materials such as black-
line masters and student sheets?
•  Is there an Internet site for further materials, 
teacher assistance, and updates?
The software programs in Table 6.1 meet these crite-
ria and have been well received by young children 
and preservice elementary school teachers. Addi-
tional software programs are referenced in Chap -
ters 8–19.
Before purchasing any software program, it is ad-
visable to preview the program. Many vendors will 
supply interested teachers or parents with a CD con-
taining a sample of their programs. Vendors also use 
the Internet to provide a preview of their software 
program.
E X E RC I S E
Interview a classroom teacher to determine what 
mathematics software is available for his or her 
students. •••
Some commercial publishers have begun to in-
clude a CD with their textbooks. The CDs contain a 
variety of materials, including games, lesson plans, 
problems, black-line masters, and interactive mathe-
matics explorations. For example, each book in the 
Navigation series by NCTM contains a CD that pro-
vides additional reading for teachers, interactive ex-
plorations for students, and further materials on the 
Navigation topic. (The Navigation series is published 
by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. 
The series contains a book for each content strand 
at each grade band.) These CDs can be an effective 
ancillary for any textbook and should be carefully 
considered when purchasing a book or adopting 
a text for the classroom. See http://www.ct4me.net/
software_index.htm, the home page of Computing 
Technology for Math Excellence, for an extensive 
list of mathematics software materials.
A growing trend is for publishers to put substan-
tial parts of their textbook or the entire textbook 
E

 
Chapter 6 The Role of Technology in the Mathematics Classroom

on a CD. It is not clear how this new trend will play 
out. CD versions of nearly every major school-level 
mathematics text are available, although the issues 
of implementation are not clear. Some school dis-
tricts are eliminating all books for middle and high 
school students and going electronic. There may be 
a desk copy of a mathematics book for students to 
use in school, but they have no personal book to 
take home. Instead, they access the book by using 
a CD on their laptop or the Internet. It is too early to 
assess the effects that such an electronic approach 
will have on student learning, but no doubt research 
studies will soon reveal their ﬁ ndings. Sufﬁ ce it to 
say that the potential for a totally electronic mathe-
matics class is here.
The Internet
More than calculators or any software program on 
a computer, the Internet has the potential to com-
pletely change mathematics learning and teaching. 
Hundreds of Internet sites provide lesson plans, test 
items, word problems, and interactive mathematics 
activities. The list of sites grows larger every month, 
with no signs of slowing down.
In Chapter 3 we addressed the question of equity 
that should be considered when using the Internet 
with students. Equity issues are important, but they 
may be mitigated by the numbers of students who 
are actively online. According to a 2006 survey by 
the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 87% of 
12–17-year-olds are online (Cassidy, 2006). The rea-
sonable expectation is that younger siblings also 
have Internet access. Such a high percent will likely 
increase, perhaps eliminating any concerns about 
equity.
Many Internet sites are designed to assist the 
teacher in almost every aspect of planning for teach-
ing mathematics. Table 6.2 lists a few sites that are 
sources for assistance, but there are many more. 
These resources are only a few of the sites that are 
available to teachers (and students) at the click of 
a mouse.
The value of any website can be weighed in 
much the same manner as we suggested to evalu -
ate software. In the case of lesson plans, determine 
if a site is juried. That is, are all the lesson plans 
submitted to a jury of professionals who determine 
if the plan meets demanding criteria before it is in-
cluded on the site? Some websites will accept any 
lesson plans that are submitted, regardless of how 
poorly conceived. Similarly, other websites should 
be reviewed for their effectiveness before fully 
adopting them for any classroom use.

limitless supply of engaging data that students can 
use to create various visual displays, from simple 
bar graphs to box-and-whisker plots. Table 6.3 is a 
list of websites that contain data about many differ-
ent topics.
Virtual Manipulatives
The most exciting development on the Internet is the 
emergence of interactive or virtual manipulatives. A 
virtual manipulative is “an interactive, Web-based 
visual representation of a dynamic object that pres-
ents the opportunity for constructing mathematical 
knowledge” (Moyer et al., 2002, p. 372). Interactive 
activities (sometimes called applets, for “small ap-
plications”) present children with an ever-expand-
ing number of interactive explorations that encom-
pass all aspects of elementary mathematics, from 
simple counting and spatial visualization activities 
to graphing statistical data and explorations involv-
ing the Pythagorean theorem.
Virtual manipulatives can be especially beneﬁ -
cial to students who have special needs or speak 
English as a second language (Figures 6.1 and 6.2). 
Some applets allow children to perform explora-
tions that would be difﬁ cult if not impossible in a 
classroom with real materials. In addition, older stu-
dents who might consider some manipulative activi-
ties as too childish will engage in similar activities 
using virtual manipulatives.

Table 6.4 provides a brief list of websites that con-
tain many different applets for various grade levels 
and across many topics, as well as links to virtual ma-
nipulatives at other sites. This list is only a glimpse of 
the resources that the Internet provides. Use these 
websites as the starting point for your own explora-
tions of sites that will enhance your teaching and 
provide exciting experiences for your students. We 
have included an Internet lesson plan in each of the 
content chapters in Part 2 to exemplify how to use 
the Internet in classroom teaching. In these chapters 
we have also described Internet math games that 
can help students learn mathematics and listed spe-
ciﬁ c websites that relate directly to the mathematics 
content of the chapters.

Many of the applets at the Internet sites listed in 
Table 6.4 contain activities that resemble activities 
of the software programs we listed earlier in this 
chapter. There may be some advantages to using 
the Internet for interactive explorations. There is no 
charge for using the Internet activities and no need 
to update any older applets. The Internet offers stu-
dents constant access, regardless of their location or 
the time of day, allowing teachers to use out-of-class 
time for such explorations. Many activities can be 
downloaded, eliminating the need for Internet ac-
cess. Internet sites allow students in many cases to

alter a website, add their own sketches or data, and 
keep a personal record of their explorations. There 
is an endless supply of virtual manipulatives, and 
cleanup is easy and instantaneous.
The full effectiveness of virtual manipulatives 
is still to be determined by research, but so far the 
ﬁ ndings are encouraging (Alejandre & Moore, 2003; 
Clements & McMillan, 1996; Keller & Hart, 2002). For 
children who have grown up playing video games 
and using computers, virtual manipulatives are not 
much different from using real manipulatives. Chil-
dren in many cases are as comfortable manipulating 
tangram pieces on the computer screen as they are 
moving tangram pieces on a desktop (Figure 6.3). 
They beneﬁ t from both activities. Using the virtual 
or real manipulatives is not an either/or situation. 
Virtual manipulatives can enhance the mathemat-
ics of actual manipulatives, and vice versa. A com-
prehensive mathematics class will use both types 
of manipulatives in appropriate ways to engage stu-
dents in building their mathematics.

Computer Games
Another aspect of technology and mathematics 
learning involves electronic games (Figure 6.4). 
Advances in computer software and technology 
and the Internet have produced many entertaining 
games, ranging from captivating adventure games 
to puzzles and logic games. Can computer games 
help students learn mathematics? In point of fact, 
the same criteria that might be applied to evaluating 
a board game such as Clue, Battleship, or Mancala
should be applied to computer games. Some factors 
to consider are the following:

 
Chapter 6 The Role of Technology in the Mathematics Classroom 
89
1.  What is the purpose of the game?
2.  What content and/or skills will be addressed?
3.  Does the game match the ability and maturity 
level of the students?
4.  Can special-needs students play the game 
effectively?
5.  How many students can play the game at one 
time?
6.  How will students receive feedback?
7.  What competition between students does the 
game encourage?
8.  How can the teacher monitor and assess student 
learning?
Research suggests that mathematical games can 
be effective teaching tools. Computer games, termed 
digital game-based learning, can help students with 
a wide range of mathematical skills and content, 
ranging from number facts and shape identiﬁ cation 
to spatial sense and proportional reasoning (Pren-
sky, 2000).
Computer games can help students recall number 
facts, practice number operations, and expand their 
Figure 6.4 Screen capture of a BBC game
mathematics vocabulary. In earlier times students 
resisted the drill and practice needed to develop 
their skills and recall. In the context of games, which 
students can play with classmates, the drudgery is 
essentially dissipated. Also, feedback is immediate 
and often comes from a colorful game character. 
Engaging games can also 
serve as explorations or 
introductory experiences 
for students.
There are two sources 
of computer games: com-
mercial software and the 
Internet. Examples of soft-
ware games include the 
following:

• http://www.ﬁ .uu.nl/rekenweb/en/
• http://www.ﬁ rstinmath.com
Research suggests that 
electronic games and ac-
tivities using the computer 
and applets (interactive, 
dynamic activities) found 
on the Internet can also 
strengthen spatial visual-
ization skills. Children en-
gaged in these activities 
use virtual manipulatives 
to improve their spatial visualization skills (Keller & 
Hart, 2002).
Video Technology
Video technology is another recent development in 
educational technology. Video programming can be 
used to present professionals in the ﬁ eld using math-
ematics, to portray scenes from which data are de-
rived and developed, and to present events (in real 
time or tape delay) that can be analyzed with math-
ematics, such as sporting events. Video programs 
can also show teachers presenting model lessons, 
classes of students engaged in mathematics explora-
tions, and interviews with professionals, mathemati-
cians, teachers, and students. Teachers can access 
video programming by means of DVDs, closed-
circuit television, open airways, the Internet, or web 
casts. Two commercial sources of video program-
ming are Futures Channel (http://www.thefutureschannel
.com) and Annenberg Media (htttp://www.learner.org).
Summary
Technology has added three tools to help students learn 
mathematics: the calculator, the computer, and the Inter-
net. Each has great potential for helping students build 
their mathematics knowledge. Nevertheless, none of 
them is a solution to the challenge of learning mathemat-
ics. They are not cure-alls. Inappropriate use of calcula-
tors or the computer can slow students’ advancement in 
mathematics. A disorganized curriculum of virtual ma-
nipulatives can turn the study of mathematics into one 
giant video game. However, research clearly supports 
these technologies as effective tools for learning mathe-
matics. We highly recommend using them in mathemat-
ics classrooms at any level.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  How have you used calculators, computers, or the 
Internet in your mathematics learning? Did you use 
a calculator or the computer in your elementary 
classes or middle grades?
 2.  Visit lesson plan sites on the Internet, and read three 
lesson plans. Critique the lesson plans. Are they 
engaging? Will students learn mathematics?
 3.  Visit the Internet site http://www.ﬁ .uu.nl/rekenweb/
en, and play one of the games. How might this game 
help children learn mathematics?
 4.  Interview an elementary school teacher at a local 
school. Ask how often children use a calculator 
and/or a computer in class, and what mathematics 
lessons require their use.
 5.  Contact any of the software vendors listed in this 
chapter, and request a sample of their program (on 
a CD or on the Internet). Try a lesson or activity from 
the program, and record your impressions. Evaluate 
the lesson using the criteria on page 84.
 6.  Use each of the digits 4–9 only once to form two 
three-digit numbers with the smallest product 
possible.

Integrating 
Assessment
ssessment is an essential skill for teachers. Without assessing 
what students know about mathematics and their level of 
skills, teachers cannot adjust instruction for students in the 
classroom. Accountability is another reason that assess-
ment is essential. Statewide tests required by the No Child 
Left Behind Act of 2002 provide information about student achievement as 
it relates to state standards. They also identify general strengths and prob-
lems in the curriculum and instruction. Some tests include diagnostic 
information about individual student mastery of skills. But standardized 
tests rarely measure student readiness for learning, attitudes toward math-
ematics, or students’ abilities to reason, solve problems, or communicate 
ideas about mathematics. Using a variety of assessment strategies, teachers 
learn about each child’s strengths and needs and adjust their instruction to 
meet them.
In this chapter you will read about:

tions and interviews, written work, performance tasks, journals 
and portfolios, and paper-and-pencil tests

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Connecting Curriculum, 
Instruction, and Assessment
Assessment is the process of ﬁ nding out what stu-
dents know and what they can do. As a result of 
assessment, teachers plan instruction to meet cur-
riculum goals from the federal, state, and local stan-
dards. Curriculum, instruction, and assessment are 
three aspects of teaching that must be coordinated. 
Curriculum describes what concepts and skills are 
to be taught, instruction includes the methods and 
activities for learning, and assessment measures stu-
dent progress toward the goals and objectives. Al-
though instruction focuses on students’ experiences 
to develop skills and concepts, “the fundamental 
role of assessment . . . is to provide authentic and 
meaningful feedback for improving student learn-
ing, instructional practice, and educational options” 
(Herman et al., 1992, p. vi). A comprehensive assess-
ment program allows teachers to explore student 
performance in several ways:
•  Determining prior knowledge and skills
•  Understanding children’s thinking
•  Identifying strengths, problems, and 
misunderstandings
•  Tracking academic progress over time
•  Encouraging student self-assessment and respon-
sibility in learning
•  Evaluating mastery of a topic or skill
Standardized tests are one part of an assessment 
program, but teachers need classroom assessments 
that are more ﬂ exible for use in daily teaching and 
learning. They need assessments that:
•  Address concepts, skills, and application of math-
ematics in meaningful contexts
•  Coordinate with instruction and occur before, 
during, and following instruction
•  Collect information about students through obser-
vations, interviews, written work, projects, presen-
tations, performance tasks, and quizzes
•  Use a variety of documentation techniques, 
including anecdotal records, checklists, rating 
scales, and scoring rubrics
•  Allow analysis of information in planning instruc-
tion to meet needs of individuals and groups
The scope and sequence of curriculum goals and 
objectives provide structure for teaching and assess-
ment. Scope describes the range of topics, concepts, 
and skills to be taught, whereas the sequence orga-
nizes knowledge and skills across grade levels, such 
as the sequence found in the NCTM grade band ex-
pectations in Appendix A. State and local schools 
often provide speciﬁ c grade-level learning targets, 
or benchmarks.
Planning for Assessment
When teachers plan for assessment, they consider 
several questions about their purpose and methods 
of data collection, analysis, and interpretation:
•  What student learning objectives or performance 
indicators are being assessed?
•  How can students demonstrate the concept, skill, 
or application being assessed, or what task or as-
signment would be appropriate for demonstrating 
this objective?
•  How can student work be recorded and 
documented?
•  What levels of performance demonstrate student 
achievement—individually and collectively?
•  What instructional actions can be taken based on 
assessment?
Answers to these questions are interrelated; the 
answer to one question inﬂ uences decisions about 
other questions. The matrix of design questions in 
Figure 7.1 helps teachers consider many issues in an 
assessment program.
Performance Objectives and Tasks
Planning for assessment begins with clear learning 
objectives that guide instruction and assessment. 
A performance objective in a unit or lesson de-
scribes the expected student learning so that teach-
ers and students understand what they are working 
toward. Performance objectives guide what the 
teacher teaches, what students are to learn, and 
what is going to be assessed during and after in-
struction. For example:
•  The student counts objects in sets (less than 50) 
in groups of 2, 3, 4, and 5.
•  The student describes and demonstrates the 0, 
1, and 2 strategies for addition.

 
Chapter 7 Integrating Assessment 
95
•  The student measures and records length in centi-
meters and inches.
•  The student collects data and displays the 
data on a bar graph that is labeled and titled 
appropriately.
Performance indicators specify how the student 
demonstrates the performance objective. The objec-
tive in instruction becomes the performance indica-
tor in assessment. The performance indicator de-
scribes what the teacher expects to see the student 
do, say, write, or demonstrate. It might include the 
situation and criterion for success. For example:
•  Count sets up to 50 in groups of 2, 3, 4, and 5 
accurately.
•  Model 0, 1, and 2 strategies, identify exam-
ples, and generalize a rule.
•  Measure and record the length of four objects us-
ing a meterstick (to the nearest centimeter) and a 
yardstick (to the nearest inch).
•  Collect data from classmates on a favorite topic, 
and display the data on a bar graph that is labeled 
and titled appropriately. Write conclusions and/or 
questions about the information from the bar 
graph.
•  Model addition problems through 9  9 using 
manipulatives.
•  Recall multiplication facts up to 10  10 with 90% 
or better accuracy.
•  Measure mass of objects less than 1 kilogram ac-
curately using a balance scale.
•  Record results of rolling two dice in a table, and 
draw conclusions about the result.

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
•  Identify critical information, and draw conclu-
sions from tables and graphs.
Mathematical attitudes and study skills are also de-
scribed with performance indicators. For example:
•  Student stays with task, is persistent.
•  Student contributes to discussion.
•  Student cooperates with partners.
•  Student presents ﬁ ndings using a spreadsheet or 
graphing program.
Creating Assessment Tasks
Lessons organized for assessment include a per-
formance indicator—the task or assignment for 
students to demonstrate learning. A lesson on 
measuring length asks students to measure 10 ob-
jects in traditional and metric systems and record 
their measurements. The teacher might also make 
sure that each student uses the correct technique. 
Assessment using two or more assessment strate-
gies increases teacher conﬁ dence about student 
understanding.
Teachers can assess an objective through a va-
riety of tasks or assignments. To identify the perfor-
mance level of the learner, teachers could use con-
crete, pictorial, or symbolic representations in the 
instructional and assessment tasks. For example, 
in Figure 7.2 addition strategies at four different lev-
els allow the teacher to determine levels of student 
understanding.
Collecting and Recording 
Assessment Information
When choosing assessment tasks, teachers also 
think about ways to collect and record student per-
formance information. Teachers learn about student 
Performance indicator:
The student generalizes the 0, 1, and 2 rules for numbers greater than 99.
The student can explain how the rules apply to numbers greater than 99.
MENTAL LEVEL (larger numbers):
Students describe their thinking about addition problems involving 0, 1, and 2 
rules with numbers larger than 99, such as 457  1, 999  1, 357  2, 898  2, 
588  0, 777  2.
Performance indicator:
The student identiﬁ es examples of the 0, 1, and 2 rules and explains them.
SYMBOLIC TASK (basic facts):
Given a page of basic addition facts, ask students to circle all the ones that show the 
1 rule in red, then the 2 rule in blue, then the 0 in green.
Ask students what they know about the answers to all the problems that follow the 
1 rule, the 2 rule, and the 0 rule.
Performance indicator:
The student identiﬁ es examples of the 0, 1, and 2 rules and explains them.
PICTORIAL TASK:
Given pictures of sets illustrating 0, 1, and 2, students sort the cards by rule and 
explain the rules.
Performance indicator:
The student uses Uniﬁ x cubes to model the 0, 1, and 2 rules.
The student can generate a rule for the result of 0, 1, and 2 addition facts.
CONCRETE TASK (model):
Given two colors of Uniﬁ x blocks, model 5  1, 6  1, 7  1 and 5  2, 6  2, 7  2.
Ask the student to give the sums. Ask the student to make more examples.
Ask if the student knows a rule for adding 1 to any number, for adding 2 to any 
number.
“Can you make another sum that shows 1 with the Uniﬁ x cubes? That shows 2?” 
Ask the student if there is a rule for 0 and to show 0 with the Uniﬁ x cubes.

performance through informal interactions with 
students as they observe and ask questions during 
work in learning centers. More formally, teachers 
may review seat work or homework or ask students 
to write in their journals or create projects and port-
folios related to the objectives being taught. Tests 
and quizzes are other means of collecting assess-
ment information. As teachers watch students work, 
they mentally note their strengths and weaknesses. 
Keeping track of student progress mentally has limi-
tations of memory and inconsistency. Recording 
student learning from the students’ performance is 
essential for analysis and interpretation of data. With-
out recording and analyzing student work, teachers 
may reduce the diagnostic power of assessment.
Recording information ranges from informal an-
ecdotal notes to more organized checklists, rating 
scales, and rubrics. When students explore math-
ematical concepts in a learning center, assessment 
procedures may be informal observations and ques-
tioning. Observation is possibly the most ﬂ exible 
data collection process, but it can be unfocused. 
To overcome this problem, teachers refer to perfor-
mance objectives and indicators to focus on the in-
tended learning. An anecdotal record is a written 
note about what a student did and said. Teachers 
develop shortcuts for anecdotal notes, as illustrated 
in the teacher’s record of Hector’s thinking while he 
measured perimeter with Uniﬁ x cubes (Figure 7.3). 
The teacher noted in parentheses which questions 
were asked. Anecdotal records may be kept on in-
dex cards or in a notebook.
A checklist connects each student to perfor -
mance objectives for the lesson or unit. In Figure 
7.4 several patterning skills are recorded for an in-
dividual student on one form. The checklist can 
be marked in a variety of ways: check marks, stars, 
question marks, ratings of 1, 2, 3, or short comments. 
The form could be used several times for multiple 
observations, interview questions, or drawn pat-
terns. Three simple patterns are included in the ﬁ g-
ure, but teachers note additional patterns created by 
children.
In Figure 7.5 a group of students is assessed while 
the students collect and organize data for display on 
a bar graph. Using a rating scale or scoring symbols,

the teacher indicates the strengths and weaknesses 
of individual students and is able to draw conclusions 
about the performance of the class as a whole.
A rating scale is a number line that indicates the 
level of performance from low to high. The scale 
in Figure 7.6 rates student performance from 1 to 4 on 
each aspect of an oral report. Ratings scales, some-
times called Likert-type scales, are quick to score 
but have a problem. Interpretation of the scores is 
often difﬁ cult because teachers may have different 
meanings for the same number. For one teacher a 
3 on a ﬁ ve-point scale may mean very good work, 
whereas another may think that a 3 is marginal 
work. When teachers fail to clearly articulate what 
each rating means, students may not know what the 
expectations are. Numbers by themselves do not de-

scribe performance levels very well. Labels such as 
excellent, proﬁ cient, average, satisfactory, or needs 
improvement are judgments but do not describe 
what the teacher expects and what the student is 
expected to demonstrate.
To clarify rating scales, teachers add descriptions 
to each number to create a scoring rubric. Rubrics 
are an effort to create a uniform understanding for 
levels of performance. Rubrics can be holistic or 
analytic. The holistic rubric is a judgment of overall 
quality for an assignment or task. If a teacher were as-
sessing student understanding of three-dimensional 
ﬁ gures, a single performance indicator that incorpo-
rates many aspects of the assignment would be:

The analytical rubric is more detailed than the 
holistic rubric; it breaks down the holistic rubric 
into several performance indicators with rubrics for 
each. The general objective “Understands 3-D ﬁ g-
ures” is broken down into ﬁ ve more speciﬁ c tasks:
•  Labels cube, pyramid, cylinder, cone, triangular 
prism, and rectangular prism
•  Identiﬁ es shape and number of faces for each
ﬁ gure
•  Identiﬁ es number of vertices and edges for each 
ﬁ gure
•  Finds examples of 3-D ﬁ gures used in everyday 
life
•  Constructs 3-D ﬁ gures using paper or 
manipulatives
For each task, a scoring rubric would describe the 
levels of performance:
•  Identiﬁ es shape and number of faces for each
ﬁ gure
Levels of performance are shown in Figure 7.7 as
a progression from rating scale to a holistic rubric to
an analytic rubric that details three dimensions of
multiplication—concepts, accuracy, and speed.
Teachers often adapt scoring rubrics and pro-
cedures from other sources. Before using any ru-
bric, teachers must carefully review it to determine
whether it is suitable for their content and level. The
Rubistar website (http://rubistar.4teachers.org
(
) provides
templates for rubrics that teachers can customize
for their assignments. A rubric for problem solving
can be found at http://www.nwrel.org/msec/mpm/scoregrid
.html. If teachers want to develop their own problem-
solving rubrics, a generic rubric with four objec -
tives and three levels of performance is shown in
Figure 7.8. Another rubric in Figure 7.9 includes
four performance dimensions with four levels of
performance.
Analyzing Student Performance 
and Making Instructional Decisions
Analysis of student performance is the ﬁ rst step in
drawing conclusions about student achievement.
The next step is to draw conclusions about the class
collectively needing more work on speciﬁ c topics.
Some students have weak performance in all topics,
and others need enrichment and extension activi-
ties. Screening or evaluating student performance
using a teacher-made preassessment or scores on
the standardized test from last year is the ﬁ rst step;
additional diagnostic assessment can be done as
each topic is introduced. Computer-managed pro-
grams supplied with textbooks or in software pack-
ages include teacher reports about student progress.
Teachers then ask whether student problems are
conceptual or procedural in nature. A short inter-
view to pinpoint problems can be useful in making
this decision. When teachers use assessment infor-
mation for instructional decisions, the time and en-
ergy spent in assessment has a great payoff.
Although teachers must analyze and interpret
each unique set of data, the assessment questions
are the same:
• What are the strengths and weaknesses of the
group overall and of individuals?
• Are there patterns of performance that help iden-
tify needs?
• Are there unusual occurrences (anomalies) in the
data that require more information?

With answers to these questions, teachers make in-
structional decisions for the group and for individu-
als. Analysis and interpretation of data is equally 
important for state or national testing results. For 
example, ﬁ fth-grade and fourth-grade teachers ﬁ nd 
strengths, weaknesses, and patterns from last year’s 
scores that identify which objectives and content 
were academic strengths and which require more 
emphasis for the coming year.

Implementing Assessment 
with Instruction
Assessment occurs before instruction starts, during 
instruction, and toward the end of instruction. Each 
stage of instruction helps the teacher know how to 
plan for student learning. In this section we describe 
how different teachers might organize assessments 
and use assessment information in teaching.
Preassessment
Before instruction, teachers determine if students 
have sufﬁ cient background and experience for the 
new learning objectives. Vygotsky (1962) describes 
the zone of proximal development as the gap be-
tween current knowledge or skill and the desired 
knowledge or skill. Students are able to learn within 
their zone of proximal development. If students do 
not have the requisite background for learning, 
the teacher provides experiences that develop the 
foundation for successful learning. For instance, if 
children have never handled money, then making 
change and calculating it will be more difﬁ cult. 
Students who have never cut a pizza into four, six, 
or eight slices do not have the same understanding 
of fractions as students who have varied experi-
ence with wholes and parts. Playing games such as 
Candyland or Yahtzee enables students to develop 
intuitive understandings about probability that are 
further developed with probability experiences.
When teachers preassess or learn about the 
background knowledge of their students, they plan 
instruction more effectively and scaffold student 
learning by supporting new skills and concepts 
based on student experiences. A short pretest or in-
terview and observation may be sufﬁ cient to deter-
mine what children know. For example, a kindergar-
ten or ﬁ rst-grade teacher assesses counting using a 
checklist that identiﬁ es several counting skills (Fig-
ure 7.10). Level of understanding is marked with an X 
for skilled or a slash for partially skilled or is left blank 
if the skill is missing. After a brief interview with each 
child for one or two minutes, the teacher obtains stu-
dent proﬁ les of counting skills and knows to plan ap-
propriate counting activities for each of them.
E X E RC I S E
What conclusions would you draw from Figure 7.10 
about the counting skills of the children? What ex-
periences would you provide for different children 
based on your conclusions? •••
With a short paper-and-pencil exercise or inter-
view, teachers can do a quick check on what stu-
dents already know on a topic being introduced 
or reviewed. Three examples of three-digit subtrac-
tion show how well students compute and under-
stand the regrouping process with base-10 blocks 
(Figure 7.11). By asking students to work each exam-

ple and show their thinking with blocks, the teacher 
can see if the children understand the process both 
conceptually and procedurally. Afterward, students 
in the class who need particular attention and stu-
dents who may need differentiated instruction on 
topics they already have accomplished can then 
be determined. Preassessment allows teachers to 
attend to the differences in achievement found in 
their classroom.
During Instruction
Assessment during instruction shows how students 
are progressing toward mastery of the lesson or unit 
objectives. Grading is deemphasized during instruc-
tion because students are in the process of learning. 
The focus on assessment is whether the students un-
derstand the concepts and skills being developed 
through lessons and activities. Another name for 
assessment during learning is formative assessment 
because it gives feedback while the concepts are 
still being learned.
Teachers gain insight into student understanding 
by watching students as they work with manipula-
tives, asking questions about what students are do-
ing or thinking, and reviewing class work or home-
work. A checklist on patterning skills summarizes 
student progress over a three-week unit (Figure 7.12). 
The teacher records student progress with bowling 
symbols (X for complete, / for partial, and blank or 
0 for little skill). The numbers 3, 2, 1 or symbols such 
as check marks, plus and minus signs, or stars are 
other quick marking systems.
Looking at the student proﬁ les on patterning, the 
teacher determines the levels of performance and 
the next instructional steps (see Figure 7.12):
Beatrice, Cari, and Damon have strong patterning 
skills; they are ready for more complex symbols 
and number patterns.
Amelio and Elena have made a lot of progress, but 
have not mastered patterning. Work in the pattern 
learning center would be a good way for them to 
develop their skill.
Frank can create patterns for himself but has not 
applied skills to existing patterns. He needs some 
small group and individual work building on his 
patterns. He could work with stringing beads and 
pattern cards.

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
An individual student recording sheet tracks student 
understanding over several assignments during a 
fraction unit (Figure 7.13). A running record of stu-
dent progress is made by taping index cards on a 
clipboard (Figure 7.14) and is a handy way to keep 
up with anecdotal notes or individual checklists.
Self-Assessment During Instruction
Teachers encourage student responsibility for 
learning when they provide opportunities for self-
assessment. Students are aware of what they un-
derstand and what they do not. Teachers can ask 
students to indicate whether they are understand-
ing with a simple hand signal: thumbs up for “I un-
derstand,” thumbs sideways for “I am not so sure,” 
and thumbs down for “I am lost.” Students write on 
personal white boards to show their answers when 
the teacher asks for a whole-class response. A quick 
scan of the responses gives immediate feedback. 
Green or red cups on the desk can indicate who 
needs help during class. A red cup asks the teacher 
to come by for a question while the students work 
on another problem.
Self-checking activities in learning centers en-
courage students to take responsibility for learning. 
Many teachers have students check their own home-
work and class work papers. When students ﬁ nd 
errors, they should focus on what they understand 
rather than on the right or wrong answers. Wrong 
answers are just a clue to a problem that needs to 
be ﬁ xed. When the emphasis is on learning rather 
than getting a good grade, students’ self-monitoring 
is a powerful motivator.
Writing as Assessment
Writing is another valuable instructional and assess-
ment technique in mathematics. Just as a ship’s cap-
tain or astronauts keep a log about what happens, 
students write about their progress in mathematics 
in journals or other assignments.
During the ﬁ rst ten minutes of our ﬁ fth-grade 
mathematics class, students are busily writ-
ing in their journals. We use journal writing 
to focus students on a review or to assess 
their ideas about a topic before its introduc-
tion. We have also used this activity to as-
sess how well students understand a topic in 
progress. We ﬁ nd that journal writing often 
brings to light thoughts and understandings 
that typical classroom interactions or tests 
do not elucidate. (Norwood & Carter, 1994, 
p. 146)
Journals serve as a record of students’ thinking and 
a place to raise questions or problems. Examples of 
questions that teachers can ask students to answer 
and record in their journals include:
•  Draw and name ﬁ ve geometric shapes; de-
scribe the characteristics of each one. How are 
they alike, and how are they different from one 
another?
•  What are some similarities among triangles, 
squares, quadrilaterals, rectangles, pentagons, 
and hexagons? How are they alike and different?
•  The newspaper article on the bulletin board says 
that the average weekly allowance of 9-year-olds 
is $10. How would you ﬁ nd out if that is true for 
you and your friends?
•  Is a square a rectangle? Is a rectangle a square? 
Explain your thinking.
Entries may be free-form or guided through leading 
questions, problems, and prompts, such as a weekly 
puzzler for journals:
•  If you had a penny for every minute you have 
lived, how much money would you have?

•  How many times does the numeral 1 occur in the 
counting numbers 1 through 100? Does 2 occur 
the same number of times as 1?
Journals also can be used to understand attitudes 
about mathematics:
•  What do you think you do best in mathematics?
•  What is your favorite part of mathematics? Why?
•  When I think of multiplication and division, I . . .
•  Today in math, I had trouble with . . .
Through writing, students reveal their under-
standing of the topics and progress toward objec-
tives by working problems, explaining their think-
ing, and asking questions about something they 
do not understand. As formative assessments, jour-
nals provide information that can be used for daily 
instruction.
Assessment at the End of Instruction
At the culmination of instruction, teachers hope and 
expect that all students have mastered the concepts 
and skills and can apply them in problem-solving 
situations. Assessments following instruction, also 
called summative assessment or mastery assess-
ment, give information about mastery of learning 
targets. Summative assessment provides account-
ability for students and for teachers. Traditionally 
quizzes were used for summative evaluation, such 
as the short subtraction quiz in Figure 7.15, which 
shows whether students have developed computa-
tional skills in subtraction.
However, a paper-and-pencil quiz may not ade-
quately assess conceptual understanding, problem-
solving, reasoning, or application objectives. A bet-
ter mastery assessment might be a performance 
task, project, presentation, or portfolio showing stu-
dent work and progress. To check conceptual un-
derstanding of multiplication, students could write 
a story, draw a picture, and write a number sentence 
for three multiplication situations. Understanding of 
“greater than” and “less than” is observed when stu-
dents play “battle” with number cards. The number 
cards could be single-digit or larger, and the game 
could be varied to ask students to ﬁ nd numbers to 
the hundreds place.
A performance task, such as that given in Figure 
7.16 on volume, asks students to go beyond compu-
tation and solve a problem in which they must show 
understanding of volume. Figure 7.17 is a perfor-
mance task that requires understanding of area and 
solving a problem. In both cases the performance 
criteria are stated so that students understand the 
expectation for demonstrating mastery.
At the end of instruction students have had time 
and opportunity to develop understanding and skills. 
Teacher conclusions about student accomplishment 
is often reported with grades, but grades are poor 
indicators of mastery. Instead, a checklist that shows 
mastery of a topic would be a better summative re-
port. On a subtraction quiz the teacher decides that 
mastery level is three out of four questions correct 
(or four out of ﬁ ve correct) and determines who has 
mastered the content. A mastery checklist shows 
which students need reteaching. Follow-up diagno-
sis identiﬁ es the source of the problem and helps 
the teacher decide what instructional action to take; 
using interviews may locate the misunderstanding.

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
Checklists or rubrics that give speciﬁ c informa-
tion about student achievement and progress can 
also be used in grading. A grading plan showing 
how different types of assessment are balanced be-
tween quizzes, projects, and daily work is illustrated 
in Figure 7.18.
A rubric or rating scale has a quality dimension 
instead of indicating simply right or wrong. When 
using a rubric in a grading plan, the teacher can cre-
ate a grade associated with total points on a rubric. 
On a ﬁ ve-point rubric a 3 could indicate satisfactory 
demonstration for each of the ﬁ ve dimensions. In 
this case 20–25 points would be an A, and 15–19 
points would be a B. Fewer than 15 points could 
mean that the student needs to revise and resubmit 
the project or portfolio.
Portfolios allow students to demonstrate learn-
ing over time. In a unit on measurement students 
could collect measurement assignments and tasks 
for a linear measurement, an area measurement, 
and a volume measurement. A rubric with the port-
folio describes the expectations for the unit, such 
as problem-solving tasks and routine activities from 
the students’ text or workbook. The portfolio would 
also include summary statements for each type of 
measurement in which students explain what they 
have learned. A portfolio is a good summative as-
sessment strategy that combines daily instructional 
activities, problem solving, and self-assessment.

Interpreting 
and Using 
Standardized 
Tests in 
Classroom 
Assessment
Standardized testing is not 
new in classrooms; how-
ever, greater emphasis has 
been placed on student 
test scores because of the 
No Child Left Behind Act 
of 2002. As a result, teach-
ers need new knowledge 
and skill with standard-
ized tests. Teachers who 
provide a full and mean-
ingful curriculum for all 
students through active 
and relevant instruction, 
as recommended in the 
NCTM principles and stan-
dards (National Council 
of Teachers of Mathemat-
ics, 2000), approach stan-
dardized testing in a posi-
tive way. They understand 
how the test is constructed, what objectives it cov-
ers, what the test scores mean, and how they are 
used. They are often expected to explain what tests 
mean to parents about their children’s performance 
in mathematics. Standardized tests can provide the 
classroom teacher with useful information about 
student learning.
Standardized tests are classiﬁ ed as norm refer-
enced or criterion referenced, although some tests 
include both types of scoring information. Norm-
referenced tests compare the scores of individual 
students to the scores of a large group of students 
who have taken the test. The bell curve, also called 
the normal distribution (Figure 7.19), is a graphic 
display of the number of students at each percentile 
rank. Half the students’ scores are above the 50th 
percentile and half are below the 50th percentile. A 
student who performs in the lowest third compared 
to others who took the test would have a percen-
tile rank between the 1st and 34th percentile. A 
student who performs in the average range would 
have a rank between the 35th and 65th percentiles. 
A student who performs above average would have 
a rank between the 66th and 99th percentiles. Stu-
dents scoring in the lowest third are in need of extra 
support and enriched instruction because they have 
not mastered the content on the test. Students in the 
upper third may need more challenging opportuni-
ties to expand their understanding.
Percentile scores allow comparison of student 
performance to national and state scores; however, 
they do not provide much diagnostic information

Part 1 Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards
about the skills and content that each student has 
mastered. Subtest scores, such as computation, 
concepts, or problem solving, give the teacher 
some clues about strengths and weaknesses, but 
classroom assessment is needed to identify speciﬁ c 
problems.
Criterion-referenced tests usually provide 
more diagnostic information for teachers because 
they show which concepts and skills each student 
has mastered instead of comparing students to each 
other. Mastery is determined by the number of items 
answered correctly for each performance objective 
and the number of objectives mastered. A criterion-
referenced test for the fourth grade might have 10 
performance objectives with four or ﬁ ve questions 
on each objective. By answering correctly three of 
four questions related to an objective, a student in-
dicates mastery of that objective. If mastery of the 
entire test is 80%, the student would be required 
to master eight of the ten objectives. If fewer than 
eight objectives were mastered, the student would 
not meet the criterion. A student’s proﬁ le from a 
criterion-referenced test in Figure 7.20 shows that 
the student mastered ﬁ ve of ten objectives but did 
not master ﬁ ve other objectives. Even if the student 
answered some question on the other objective 
correctly, not enough items were correct to show 
mastery. Diagnostic follow-up with an interview or 
observation can help the teacher ﬁ nd exactly which 
skills or concepts were weak, and the teacher can 
plan for reteaching. When teachers review student 
proﬁ les for a class or grade level, they ﬁ nd objec-
tives that were mastered or not mastered by most 
of the students in the class and identify individual 
students who need special help. Even when stan-
dardized testing is used, classroom assessment is 
necessary to identify speciﬁ c student strengths and 
weaknesses.
Standardized tests and their use have raised 
many concerns. Many parents and teachers believe 
that such tests have narrowed the curriculum and 
have created too much “teaching to the test.” They 
also dislike the pressure that standardized tests place 
on children. Another concern is whether standard-
ized tests adequately measure the range of skills 
and abilities in mathematics. Standardized tests 
may measure what is easy to test rather than what 
is important. Deciding what the test items should be 
and how difﬁ cult they are is a major concern in test 
development. Furthermore, several states have ex-

Test bias is another point of concern. Test bias 
means that items on the test provide an advantage or 
disadvantage as a result of content or wording that 
is more familiar to one group than another. Minority 
students and those learning English may experience 
test bias, although students who speak English also 
interpret questions differently depending on geo-
graphic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. Effort 
has been made to improve standardized tests; how-
ever, many questions still remain about their validity 
and use.

Summary
Assessment is the process of collecting, organizing, 
analyzing, and using information about student achieve-
ment and progress to improve instruction. Assessment 
and instruction are based on curriculum goals and ob-
jectives. Before instruction, teachers discover students’ 
background knowledge and plan with this information. 
During instruction, feedback on student progress guides 
daily planning. At the conclusion of instruction, assess-
ment shows whether students have learned the content 
and identiﬁ es the strengths and weaknesses for the group 
and for individual learners.
Performance objectives and indicators describe how 
students demonstrate their knowledge and skill. Assess-
ment planning allows teachers to gather information, an-
alyze, and interpret information about learning. Written 
work, interviews, observations, projects, performance 
tasks, portfolios, and quizzes are sources of assessment 
information. Anecdotal notes, checklists, rating scales, 
and rubrics may be used to record and summarize stu-
dent achievement. After analysis, teachers determine 
instructional strategies and activities for students who 
have mastered the objectives and for students who need 
additional experiences.
The emphasis on standardized testing brought about 
by the No Child Left Behind Act has distressed many 
teachers and parents because of the time spent on testing 
and preparing for the test, the narrow focus of instruction, 
and problems with the validity of the testing program. 
Good teachers provide rich mathematical experiences 
based on the curriculum. They combine standardized 
testing information with classroom assessment to gain 
a more complete understanding of student performance 
and needs and to improve their teaching.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Do you remember having checklists, ratings scales, 
and rubrics as part of the assessment process in 
elementary school? high school? college? If so, what 
did you like or dislike about them?
 2.  Interview two or three elementary school teach-
ers. Ask how they assess student learning. Do they 
use alternative, or informal, assessment strategies 
such as performance tasks, projects, or portfolios? If 
students keep portfolios or journals, ask if you may 
look at them. What features of portfolios or journals 
described in this chapter do you see in the students’ 
products?
 3.  Select one or two students to observe over several 
mathematics class periods. Ask the students to show 
you their work and explain what they are doing. 
Take anecdotal records, and draw some conclusions 
about their skill and knowledge.
 4.  Ask two teachers for their perspective on state or 
district testing programs. What do you think about 
your state testing program?
 5.  Many schools are required by their state depart-
ment of education to post their test results on the 
Internet. Find a school report card, and look at the 
test results for a school near you. How well are the 
students in the school doing in mathematics? Are 
the students’ scores reported by percentile, mastery 
level, or both?

 6.  One teacher says that he is “teaching to the test,” 
and another says that she is “teaching the test.” 
Which approach is more defensible for teachers?
 7.  A parent has come to you with a newspaper head-
line that states that 50% of fourth-graders are at or 
below grade level in mathematics. How would you 
explain this to the parent?
 8.  Two major critics of standardized testing and inter-
pretation are Alﬁ e Kohn and Gerald Bracey. Search 
on the Internet for articles by them, and summarize 
their major concerns about the use of standardized 
tests.

Developing 
Problem-Solving 
Strategies
roblem solving is central to teaching and learning math-
ematics. This long-standing NCTM position regarding 
problem solving was reiterated in the 2000 Principles and 
Standards for School Mathematics:
By learning problem solving in mathematics, students should 
acquire the ways of thinking, habits of persistence and curiosity, 
and conﬁ dence in unfamiliar situations that will serve them well 
outside the mathematics classroom. In everyday life and in the 
workplace, being a good problem solver can lead to great advan-
tages. (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000, p. 52)
 
As the ﬁ rst process skill, problem solving is critical for developing 
other process skills and content knowledge. Students who learn from 
a problem-solving perspective construct their own understanding of 
mathematics instead of memorizing rules that they do not comprehend.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
At one time, problem solving in mathematics in-
struction was equated with a few word problems 
at the end of a chapter; students would pick num-
bers from the problem and apply the most re  -
cently learned computation. Without development 
of problem-solving skills, word problems became 
a source of much frustration and little success for 
many students. Students were often perplexed when 
they encountered realistic problems and had to de-
cide which operations to use, what numbers to in-
clude, and whether their answers made sense.
Today, problem solving 
is a central focus of mathe-
matics teaching and learn-
ing. A balanced approach 
found in the NCTM stan-
dards (National Council 
of Teachers of Mathemat-
ics, 2000) recognizes the 
importance of computa-
tion and the vitality that 
problem solving gives to learning mathematics. 
Problem solving is the ﬁ rst process skill in the NCTM 
standards and is fundamental to the comprehensive 
mathematics curriculum described in Chapter 2.
Effective elementary teachers encourage cre-
ative and critical thinking in all subjects. Teachers 
ﬁ nd realistic problems in children’s experiences that 
help teach mathematical skills and concepts. Realis-
tic situations, imagined events, puzzles, games, and 
manipulatives create problems that students can 
confront and engage in. Students discover concepts 
and procedures and apply them in interesting and 
novel situations; they become mathematicians as 
they solve a variety of problems.
When business, government, and other leaders 
look at essential job skills for employees, they em-
phasize the abilities to think critically and creatively, 
to solve problems, to communicate effectively in 
written and spoken form, and to work cooperatively 
on a team. The connection between a problem-solv-
ing approach and real-life skills is obvious.
. . . to function in our complex and chang-
ing society, people need to be able to solve 
a wide variety of problems. The elementary 
math curriculum must prepare children to 
become effective problem solvers. (Burns, 
2000, p. 4)
With a repertoire of problem-solving strategies, 
students can understand a problem, develop a plan, 
and carry out their plan. Then they can consider 
whether their answer is reasonable and whether 
there are alternative answers or approaches, and ﬁ -
nally they can communicate their answer and their 
reasoning. The ability to compute accurately is es-
sential in problem solving, but thinking is at the core 
of mathematics teaching and learning.
Every lesson can teach problem-solving skills, 
as Ms. Eckelkamp found when she asked her 
third-grade class to consider transportation for a 
ﬁ eld trip.
Ms. Eckelkamp: Since we are studying animals 
and habitats, we are going to the zoo. We have 27 
children in our class. Let’s talk about how we are 
going to go to the zoo.
Evan: We could walk to the zoo.
Tara: It’s too far; we should ride in cars.
Ms. Eckelkamp: How many cars would we need?
Kayleigh: Our car has two seatbelts in the front 
and three in the back, so four children can ride in 
each car. Six cars carry four children: Six cars with 
four children is 24 children.
Kim: But we have 27 children. We would need seven 
cars for everybody unless three people were sick.
Joaquina: Some cars have two seatbelts in the 
back. Three children could ride in some cars. 
Twenty-seven divided by three is nine cars. Some 
cars hold four children and others three; I think we 
need eight cars.
Ali: Our van has seven seats—everybody could 
ride in four vans.
Jorge: One van is the same as one large car and 
one small car.
Terrell: One school bus would hold everybody 
with room for Ms. Eckelkamp and parents.
Real-life problems require more than computing 
27  4  6, remainder 3. For problems similar to the 
one illustrated, the National Assessment of Educa-
tion Progress found that many students in elemen-
tary and middle grades gave the computed answer 
of 6, remainder 3, rather than the realistic answer 
of 7. In addition to calculating, it is essential that 
students explain whether the answer makes sense, 
how conditions might affect the answer, and how

Approaches to Teaching 
Problem Solving
Teaching About, Teaching for, 
and Teaching via Problem Solving
Schroeder and Lester (1989) describe three ap-
proaches to problem-solving instruction:
•  Teaching about problem solving.
•  Teaching for problem solving.
•  Teaching via problem solving.
Teaching about problem solving focuses on 
teaching steps and strategies. Problems are exer-
cises to practice the strategies. When teaching for
problem solving, teachers introduce strategies with 
exercises based on real-world situations. In the third 
approach, teaching via problem solving, problem 
solving becomes the carrier for both content and 
process. Solving a problem requires comprehen-
sion of the problem and understanding a variety of 
strategies that might be applied; as a result of solv-
ing the problem, students develop both the answer 
or answers and the content and skills needed for 
the problem. Addition is learned from problems 
in which children combine sets to ﬁ nd the answer. 
E
Division is learned when children divide a set into 
equal groups according to the situation. Measure-
ment skills and concepts develop from activities 
such as measuring heights, scheduling events in 
class and at home, and determining the cost of a 
new classroom printer and how to get the funds. 
By confronting a variety of problems with different 
challenges, students develop concepts, procedures, 
ﬂ exibility in thinking, and conﬁ dence in attacking 
new situations.
The Four-Step Problem-Solving Process
Students need many realistic, open-ended problems 
because realistic problems offer the opportunity to 
uncover important mathematics content. A problem 
is a situation that has no immediate solution or known 
solution strategy. If the answer is already known, 
there is no problem. If the procedure is known, the 
solution involves substitution of information into the 
known process. If neither the answer nor the proce-
dure is known, students need techniques for solving 
the problem. George Polya, in his pioneering book 
How to Solve It (1957), suggests a four-step problem-
solving process. This general strategy or organizer, 
called a heuristic, applies to all problem solving 
and parallels the scientiﬁ c method.

Polya’s problem-solving steps are commonly 
included in elementary mathematics textbooks as 
a problem-solving guide for students, using terms 
such as understand, plan, do, and check back. In 
real-life problems the learner considers various 
strategies, makes decisions about the effectiveness 
and reasonableness of processes and solutions, and 
draws conclusions and generalizations about the 
results.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Eleven Problem-Solving Strategies: 
Tools for Elementary School Students
Problem-solving strategies are tools that students use 
to solve problems. They help students understand 
the problem, develop and implement their plan, and 
evaluate the reasonableness of their solution. Rea-
soning, communicating, representing, and connect-
ing are involved when students solve problems:
Many of the process skills needed in math-
ematics are similar to reading skills, and 
when taught together would reinforce each 
other. (Sutton and Krueger, 2002, p. 17)
Students develop and reﬁ ne strategies as they 
solve different problems, including nonroutine, 
open-ended, and divergent situations. Having a rep-
ertoire of strategies allows them to use strategies in 
ﬂ exible ways to approach new situations. Eleven 
problem-solving strategies, or tools, are important 
for elementary students:
1.  Find and use a pattern: Students identify a pat-
tern and extend the pattern to solve the problem.
2.  Act it out: By acting out a problem situation, 
students understand the problem and devise a 
solution plan.
3.  Build a model: Students use objects to represent 
the situation.
4.  Draw a picture or diagram: Students show what 
is happening in the problem with a picture or a 
diagram.
5.  Make a table and/or a graph: Students organize 
and record their data in a table, chart, or graph. 
Students are more likely to ﬁ nd a pattern or see 
a relationship when it is shown visually.
6.  Write a mathematical sentence: If the problem 
involves numbers and number operations, strate-
gies often lead to a mathematical sentence or 
expression of a relationship with numbers or 
symbols.
7.  Guess and check, or trial and error: By exploring 
a variety of possible solutions, students discover 
what works and what doesn’t. Even if a potential 
solution does not work, it may give clues to other 
possibilities or help the student to understand 
the problem.
8.  Account for all possibilities: Students systemati-
cally generate many solutions and ﬁ nd the ones 
that meet the requirements of the problem 
situation.
 9.  Solve a simpler problem, or break the problem 
into parts: If a problem is too large or compli-
cated to attack, students can reduce the size 
of the problem or break it into parts to make it 
more manageable.
10.  Work backward: Considering the goal ﬁ rst can 
make some problems easier. Starting with the 
end in mind helps students develop a strategy 
that leads to the solution by backing through 
the process.
11.  Break set, or change point of view: When a strat-
egy is not working, students need ﬂ exibility in 
their thinking. They may need to discard what 
they are doing and try something else or think 
about the problem in a different way.
These 11 strategies are tools for understanding, 
organizing, implementing, and communicating 
problems, solutions, and mathematical concepts. 
One strategy may lead to a solution, but often a com-
bination of strategies is required. Many mathematics 
textbooks and trade books include excellent exer-
cises for developing the strategies. However, strat-
egy instruction is a means rather than the end of 
problem solving.
Find and Use a Pattern. Humans live in a world 
full of patterns: in art, architecture, music, nature 
(Figure 8.1), design, and human behavior. Patterns 
are generally deﬁ ned as repeated sequences of 
objects, actions, sounds, or symbols. Patterns may 
also include variations or anomalies because they 
are not perfect. Patterns are related to expectations 
and predictions. If something has happened before, 
humans expect that it will happen again. Novelty oc-
curs when something unexpected happens. Patterns 
can be simple or complex, real or abstract, visual or 
aural. Recognizing and using patterns is a critical 
human thinking ability.
The ability that even infants have to gradu-
ally sort out an extremely complex, chang-
ing world must be considered astounding, as 
well as evidence that this is the natural way 

 
Chapter 8 Developing Problem-Solving Strategies

learning advances. But more surprising still 
is the clear fact that the learner manages to 
learn from input presented in a completely 
random, fortuitous fashion—unplanned, 
accidental, unordered, uncontrolled. (Hart, 
1983, p. 65)
Without the ability to ﬁ nd and use patterns to orga-
nize their world, humans would live in a world of 
chaos.
Young children create patterns based on color 
with common manipulatives: pattern blocks, color 
tiles, links, and multilink cubes. Commercial or 
teacher-made templates guide children’s pattern 
work (Figure 8.2) from simple two-element patterns 
to more complex patterns with three or four ele-
ments. Students match patterns, read color patterns, 
and extend pattern:
Red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, . . .
Yellow, green, green, yellow, green, green, . . .
Blue, green, yellow, blue, green, red, blue, green, 
yellow, . . .
Other patterns can be found and made using the 
children themselves. They can arrange themselves 
by type of shoe, color of eyes, or positions:
Sandal, sneaker, sandal, sneaker, . . .
Brown, blue, green, brown, blue, green, . . .
Sit, stand, sit, stand, sit, stand, . . .
Rather than limiting instruction to one or two 
examples, teachers should present many patterns 
of different types and ask students to ﬁ nd and ex-
tend them. Activity 8.1 shows how people patterns 
develop into symbolic notation for patterns. As stu-
dents gain understanding of patterns, they begin 
to create their own patterns that demonstrate their 
understanding. In Chapter 7 an assessment strategy 
for patterns shows how teachers can document stu-
dents’ developing skills.
Patterns are a foundation skill for algebra and 
algebraic thinking (Figure 8.3). Even numbers are 
those numbers that can be broken down into pairs, 
giving a numerical sequence of 2, 4, 6, 8, . . . . Prime 
numbers are those that have only one set of factors: 
17  1  17. Intermediate-grade students work with 
patterns and sequences that increase, decrease, 
and overlap in more complex ways than the patterns 
used with younger students. More complex patterns 
can be found in the relationships between numbers.
Increasing sequence: 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 4, 16, . . .
Decreasing sequence: 100, 90, 81, 73, 66, 60, . . .

Figure 8.3 Patterns
In Chapter 16, the role of patterns in algebraic think-
ing demonstrates how patterns are represented
physically, in pictures, numerically, and, ﬁ nally, in
symbolic notation. Algebra often is a generalized
expression of a pattern: n2 is an expression for all

square numbers, 2n is an expression for all even 
numbers, b  h/2  A is a formula for the area of 
a triangle.
Activity 8.2 demonstrates how counting the num-
ber of squares in a geometric design turns into a pat-
tern activity with algebraic implications. Primary 
children count and look for a pattern; older children 
use the pattern to generate a rule or mathematical 
expression. Beginning with simple patterns and pro-
gressing to more complex forms, students learn that 
patterns are powerful thinking skills for problem 
solving.
Learning about patterning is not limited to math-
ematics but is connected to other school subjects. 
When children learn to play patterns with musical 
instruments, they develop skills used in reading sen-
tences and words. Rhyming words, short and long 
vowel sounds, and preﬁ xes and sufﬁ xes are other 
important patterns in reading. Science is often de-
scribed as the study of patterns in the natural world. 
Students discover patterns in plant leaves, by ob-
serving the change of tadpoles to frogs, and from 
the chemical reactions between vinegar and differ-
ent rocks.
E X E RC I S E
Look in a textbook or resource book for examples of 
patterns and sequences. Share those examples with 
classmates. Do you ﬁ nd opportunities for students 
to ﬁ nd patterns, extend patterns, and create pat-
terns of their own? •••
E
Act It Out. In the act-it-out strategy children dra-
matize or simulate a problem situation to help them 
understand the problem and create a plan of action. 
When the situation is acted out with readily avail-
able props, the solution is often obvious. A new 
mathematical operation, such as takeaway subtrac-
tion, is presented through stories, as seen here:
•  Ignacio has seven bananas. He gives three ba-
nanas to Marta.
•  Mary Lou collected 16 basketball cards. She sold 
four of her cards to Roby.
Children take turns acting out the story and then 
talk about the result of the action. After several sto-
ries have been acted out, children can make up 
ACTIVITY 8.1
 
Making People Patterns
Level: Grades PreK– 2
Setting: Small groups or whole group
Objective: Students make people patterns.
Materials: Cards for pattern labels
•  Call on children to stand in a pattern created according to 
their characteristics and their clothing:
Boy-girl, boy-girl, boy-girl, . . .
Athletic shoes, leather, athletic shoes, leather, . . .
Black hair, blond hair, brown hair, black hair, blond hair, 
brown hair, . . .
•  Lead the children in “reading” the pattern (“black hair, 
blond hair, brown hair, . . .”). Ask what goes next, and 
have children join the pattern. Allow children to suggest 
other patterns.
•  Have students join in as soon as they understand the pat-
tern. Nodding the head for the “pause” is a good way to 
maintain the rhythm.
•  Have children hold label cards for the characteristics and 
read the pattern again.

their own stories and act them out. The action of 
takeaway subtraction is developed in a problem set-
ting, and the solution is represented with objects, 
through actions, in pictures, and ﬁ nally with num-
ber sentences. Many informal activities invite stu-
dents to act out mathematical situations. Children 
can make purchases at a classroom store stocked 
with food and household product containers.
Role playing serves as a motivator for investiga-
tions and projects:
•  Plan a menu for the week. Make a grocery list, 
and use the newspaper ads to get prices for your 
shopping list. How much do you estimate it will 
take to buy your groceries for the week?
•  Create a household budget. Creating a house-
hold budget requires a record of earnings and 
payments. A game simulation would have each 
student draw a weekly Earn card and four Bill 
cards. The class bank cashes the Earn card. Bills 
are paid in the class stores.
•  Design a room. Measure, make a scale model, 
and show your selections of furniture, carpet, 
paint, and accessories. Several programs on tele-
vision model the design process.
Board games, from Junior Monopoly to Clue, 
include role playing that develops thinking skills 
and strategies. To Market, To Market (Santa Cruz, 
CA: Learning in Motion; available at http://www.learn
.motion.com) is a computer simulation of shopping 
that presents children with many problem-solving 
situations.
Children’s literature that focuses on mathemati-
cal concepts, such as The Doorbell Rang (Hutchins, 
1986), offers opportunities for acting out stories 
and exploring mathematical ideas. In The Doorbell 
Rang the concept of division is explored when the 
number of cookies per person is reduced as more 
people ring the doorbell and come in. On Who 
Wants to Be a Millionaire? contestants answer ques-
tions for prizes that double repeatedly in value from

How Many Rectangles? (Reasoning, Representation)
Level: Grades 3– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students count the rectangles in a row of dominoes.
Materials: Dominoes
•  Have students place one domino on their desk. Ask how 
many rectangles they see. For this exercise a domino is 
counted as one rectangle. Other rectangles are combina-
tions of whole dominoes.
•  Have students place two dominoes in a row. Ask how 
many rectangles they see now. (Answer: Three, from two 
single dominoes and one made of two dominoes.)
•  Next, have them look at three dominoes and determine 
how many rectangles are shown. (Answer: Six, from three 
single dominoes, two double dominoes, and one triple 
domino rectangle.)
•  Make a table to show the results.

•  Look at the table, and ask if they see a pattern in the 
number of rectangles. (Answer: Students will likely see 
the pattern of adding 2, 3, 4, and so on to the number of 
rectangles. They may also see that the additional number 
of rectangles is equal to the number of dominoes.)
•  Ask students how many rectangles they believe they 
might ﬁ nd if they lined up 4, 5, 6, . . . , 10 dominoes.
•  Introduce the idea of triangular numbers being numbers 
that can be drawn in a triangle shape. Older students 
may also ﬁ nd that the expression         gives the triangular 
numbers.

$100 to $1,000,000. In Activity 8.3 students act out 
two scenarios about getting paid with play money. 
They also explore the geometric progression of dou-
bling. Compounding with interest is another inter-
esting progression that can be estimated with the 
expression 72 divided by the rate of interest, which 
gives the number of years an investment doubles. 
For example, 72 divided by 8 percent interest gives 
9 years to double an investment. Ask students how 
many years it would take to become a millionaire 
starting with $1,000.
Acting out situations and representing the results 
in writing and symbols enhances algebraic thinking 
because students can see patterns emerging from 
their actions.
Build a Model. Working with manipulatives (pen-
cils, teddy bears, plastic beads) can create interest 
in new topics and helps students construct their 
understanding of concepts. With younger children 
more realistic materials are better. Plastic dinosaurs 
are more obvious models in a story about dinosaurs. 
After having many problem-solving experiences, 
students realize that dinosaurs and other real ob-
jects can be represented with cubes, tiles, or sticks. 
Manipulatives can be easily rearranged to show ac-
tions in a story problem. They show the beginning 
and ending situation through their arrangement. 
Models invite students to try various solutions free 
from a sense of failure.
In Activity 8.4 modeling with pattern block tri-
angles shows a relationship between the number of 
triangles in a row and the perimeter of the ﬁ gure. In 
Activity 8.5 modeling with wheels is used to answer 
the question of how many unicycles, bicycles, and 
tricycles were rented.

the problem. Children should become comfortable 
with simple “math art” rather than try to make every-

Payday (Reasoning, Representation)
Level: Grades 3–6
Setting: Cooperative groups or pairs
Objective: Students represent a pattern by acting out a situation.
Materials: Blank calendars and play money purchased or created 
by teams of children. Students will need large and small denomi-
nations. Ask them to ﬁ nd out which denominations of money are 
printed.
•  Pose the following situation: You are offered a job, and 
you can choose how to get paid: either $50,000 for a 
month or $1 on day 1, $2 on day 2, $4 on day 3, $8 on 
day 4, and doubling for each workday in the month. 
Which job would you take? Why?
•  Ask students to predict which would be more: $50,000 or 
doubling their pay for 20 days of work.
•  Have students count out $50,000 with play money. Then 
have them act out getting paid $1 on day 1, $2 on day 
2, and so on. Print a calendar of the current month for 
students to record the amount of money earned each 
weekday, and keep a running total.
•  Ask if it would make any difference if they worked 22 
days in the month or 25 days?
Extensions
•  Have students represent the amounts in exponents of 2 
on the calendar.
•  Have students look at average salaries for different occu-
pations and the educational requirements for them. Ask if 
they see a relationship between education and salaries.

Materials: Plastic disks, poker chips, or counters to serve as models 
of wheels
•  Seven people rent cycles for a ride at the beach. They 
have their choice of unicycles, bicycles, and tricycles. For 
seven riders, what is the largest and smallest number of 
wheels possible? (Answer: 21 for the largest number of 
wheels and 7 for the smallest.)
•  Ask students to model different combinations of wheels 
and to report their solutions. What combinations of cycles 
could the cyclists have rented?
•  Record their answers in a table to show the three types 
of cycles and the total. Students should be encouraged to 
look for many possible combinations.

•  Ask students to model different combinations if they 
know only the number of wheels such as seven, but not 
the number of riders. As students become more system-
atic in their approach, the number of wheels can increase. 
Students should see quickly that the possible solutions 
become large.

triangles, and doodles can represent situations sim-
ply and quickly. Rubber stamps of animals, shapes, 
ﬂ owers, and other designs can also illustrate prob-
lems and reduce the time needed for drawing. As 
children mature in their understanding, numerical 
and other symbolic expressions can replace mod-
els, pictures, and diagrams. A sketch of distances in 
Activity 8.6 shows what is known about a problem 
and what is unknown. Labeling the diagram makes 
the number sentence and solution easier.
Venn diagrams help students visualize situations 
in which classiﬁ cation and belonging to part of a 
group are important.

lationships become more complex, Venn diagrams 
are more important in understanding a problem and 
ﬁ nding an answer, as shown by a question from the

Make a Table and/or a Graph. Learning to make 
a table or a graph is simultaneously a problem-
solving strategy and mathematical content. Con-
cepts and skills related to data collection, analysis,

pret information from problems. Recording data 
gives a visual display so that students can see what 
information they have collected; then they can look 
for patterns and relationships.

Research for the Classroom
•
In the 1980s girls generally were found to have lower 
spatial scores on tests. In 1982 Joan Skolnick and her as-
sociates cited research concluding that young girls are less 
likely than boys to engage in play activities that involve 
objects (models) such as blocks, balls, toy trains, and air-
planes (Skolnick et al., 1982). They thought that different 
play activities might contribute to the differences in spatial 
visualization. As a result, girls’ spatial visualization skills 
may not be as fully developed as boys’. In a 1997 study in 
Sweden, Swensson and colleagues reported changes in 
spatial reasoning ability. They tested different groups of 
boys and girls over 25 years and found increases for both 
sexes, but the girls’ scores had increased more rapidly and 
almost equaled the boys’ scores by 1995 (Swensson et al., 
1997). Bruer (1999) concluded that spatial skills of boys 
and girls based on tests differ in only minimal ways.

Children can refer to the table to answer additional 
questions.
•  If Lena had one nickel, what other coin combina-
tions could she have?
•  If Lena had seven pennies, what other coin com-
binations could she have?
•  If Lena had one dime, what other coin combina-
tions could she have?
As students gain skill and conﬁ dence, they can 
change the parameters in the problem:
•  If Lena had 76 cents, how many coin combina-
tions could she have?
As the problem becomes more complex, a collabor-
ative table might be placed on the bulletin board so 
that children can post different answers as they ﬁ nd 
them. When many solutions are posted, children 
pose questions based on the variety of solutions.
A rate table is often used to show the relationship 
between two sets of numbers.

How Far? (Reasoning, Communication)
Level: Grades 3–6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students draw a diagram to show what is known in a 
problem and what is unknown.
Materials: Handmade road sign for distances in your area, a road 
map
•  Present this story to students: Starting from their home 
in western Tennessee, John’s family drove to visit his 
grandmother in Knoxville. When they left home, they saw 
a road sign.
•  Show the road sign, and discuss the information it gives 
you.
Nashville
Crossville
Knoxville
95 miles
200 miles
275 miles
•  When they got to Nashville, John wanted to know how 
many miles were left until they reached Crossville and 
Knoxville.
•  Ask students to draw a diagram and label the known 
distances. The unknown distances can be shown with a 
dotted line.
•  The diagram may allow students to label the distance 
between the cities by inspection. They can see that the 
difference between 275 miles and 200 miles is 75 miles. 
Likewise the difference between 200 miles and 95 miles is 
105 miles.
•  Students can also express the mileages in different num-
ber sentences and equations.
200  95  distance from Nashville to Crossville 
 
200  95  105 miles
200  distance from Nashville to Crossville  95 
 
200  105  95 miles

•  Connect to social studies with a map of Tennessee. Iden-
tify some possible locations for John’s home and starting 
point. This will allow students to ﬁ nd the location of the 
sign on the map.
•  For the trip, ﬁ nd places on the route for rest stops and 
sightseeing.
•  Estimate the time between the towns and rest stops us-
ing 60 miles per hour and 70 miles per hour. How many 
gallons of gasoline are needed if the car gets 20 miles per 
gallon? 25 miles per gallon? 30 miles per gallon? What 
would the trip cost using current gas prices?
•  Ask students to create similar problems using the map of 
their state to make road signs.

Chapter 8 Developing Problem-Solving Strategies 
125
Many examples from other problem-solving strat-
egies include creation of a table to record the results 
of the strategy of modeling or seeking a pattern. Ta-
bles and graphs make relationships, changes, and 
trends more apparent so that students can ﬁ nd and 
interpret patterns.
Write a Mathematical Sentence. While solving 
problems, students communicate and represent 
their thinking through modeling, acting, drawing, 
and writing. A word sentence describes the problem 
situation, as does a number sentence.
•  Natasha has four apples and ﬁ ve oranges. She has 
a total of nine pieces of fruit.
4 apples  5 oranges  9 pieces of fruit
 
4  5  9
As seen in many examples in this chapter, a num-
ber sentence developed from models, drawings, and 
acted-out problems summarizes the problem situa-
tion. Even when the computation is routine or the 
answer is evident, the skill of writing a number sen-
tence is critical. The state assessment of academic 
skill in Texas asks students to write or choose a num-
ber sentence that describes the problem. Two items 
from the released test for ﬁ fth-grade are shown in 
Figure 8.5; 89% of the students answered item 22 
correctly, and 83% were correct on item 27.

What are the answers to the two questions in Figure 
8.5? How did you solve the problems? Were the an-
swers obvious, or did you use a strategy? •••
E
Writing a number sentence is important when 
students learn about the basic operations of addi-
tion, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When 
learning about multiplication, for example, a story 
with an addition sentence provides the foundation 
for understanding multiplication and its representa-
tion in a number sentence.
•  Jonas has 5 quarters. How much money does he 
have?
25  25  25  25  25  125
 
5  25  125
Writing a number sentence is also important in 
showing division as repeated subtraction. Students 
can model repeated subtraction with coins and see 
how division is related to subtraction.
•  Veena had $2.00. She spent $0.30 for each eraser. 
How many erasers did she buy?
$2.00  0.30  0.30  0.30  0.30  0.30  0.30 
 0.20
$2.00 divided by 0.30  6 erasers 
with 0.20 left over
Students usually write their own number sentences 
to solve problems rather than eliminate equations, 
as done in the test examples. Calculators allow stu-
dents to concentrate on the problem rather than 
on computations as they compare several possible 
answers.
•  Amber shopped at the grocery store for supper. 
She wanted to buy bread for $3.00, milk for $3.00, 
spaghetti sauce for $4.00, hamburger for $5.00,

•  A new car was advertised in the newspaper for 
$16,999. How much would Kane pay each month

ment of $2,000 and an interest rate of 6%?
•  Determine distances for trips from Miami, Florida, 
to Seattle, Washington, using three different 
routes on interstate highways.
Guess and Check, or Trial and Error. Guess and 
check, also called trial and error, is an all-purpose 
problem-solving technique in which several pos-
sible solutions are attempted to solve a problem. 
Instead of going for the right answer immediately, 
students see what works and what doesn’t. Even if 
the attempts do not yield the answer, they often give 
clues to the solution. On the second or third try stu-
dents may ﬁ nd a pattern that leads to the desired 
result. Using a calculator, students in Ms. McCuen’s 
class examine several results to a number puzzle.
•  Two numbers multiplied together have a product 
of 144. When the larger number is divided by the 
smaller number, the quotient is 4.
Kara: I know 12  12 is 144.
Keesha: But 12 divided by 12 is 1, so the two num-
bers can’t be 12 and 12.
Josue: I multiplied 4 and 36 and got 144.
Lollie: But 36 divided by 4 is 9, not 4.
Jonice: Let’s make a table so we can see the num-
bers we have tried.

Joaquin: What number is between 12 and 4? I 
think it will have to be even to get an even product. 
Let’s try 6 and 8.
Kara: If you divide 144 by 6, you get 24.
Keesha: That’s it! Twenty-four divided by six is four. 
Does 8 work too?
Joaquin: I made up another puzzle. Two numbers 
multiplied together are 180, and the difference 
between them is 3.
In this case students recognized that a table 
would help them organize guess-and-check solu-
tions. When teachers refrain from demanding imme-
diate solutions, they encourage thinking. In problem 
solving, “See what works” is a good strategy.
Guess-and-check does not mean making wild 
guesses but making reasonable choices. If a large 
jar of gumballs is presented, students may guess 
anything from 100 to 1,000,000. If teachers provide a 
benchmark, or referent, they guide students to rea-
sonable guesses. A large jar ﬁ lled with gumballs is 
displayed along with a smaller jar containing only 
50 gumballs. Students compare 
the number in the smaller jar to 
the size of the large jar, then write 
their estimates on a chart or in 
their journal: “My estimate for the 
number of gumballs in the large 
jar is ____ because ____ .” Another 
approach is to exhibit the smaller 
referent jar after students have 
made initial estimates. Students 
count the number in the referent 
and adjust their estimates. Origi-
nal estimates might range from 
100 to 5,000, but after counting 
the referent jar of 133, estimates 
become more consistent and accurate, such as 800 
to 1,330. Reasonableness is the goal in estimation, 
so teachers should avoid giving prizes for the best 
estimate. Instead, they should help students identify 
a range of good estimates, such as 1,000– 1,200.
Number puzzles (Figure 8.6) also invite guess-
and-check thinking. In Figure 8.6a the numerals 0 
to 8 are arranged so that all the sums down and 
across are 12. In Figure 8.6b the numerals 1 to 8 are 
placed so that the sums on each side of the square 
are all 11. To solve the puzzles, students try several 
arrangements of numbers. If numerals are written 
on small pieces of paper, they can be easily moved, 
making number puzzles faster and less frustrating. 
The wrong combination can give clues for the cor-
rect answer. After solving the ﬁ rst set of puzzles, stu-
dents see if they can ﬁ nd solutions for other sums, 
such as 10 or 13.

Account for All Possibilities. Accounting for all 
possibilities is a strategy that is often used with other 
strategies. Using the guess-and-check strategy may 
naturally lead to an organized approach of what 
works and what does not. Creating a table of possible 
answers often is used to identify a pattern or relation-
ship, such as riders and wheels or combinations of 
coins. In primary grades children model all the pos-
sible sums for 7 with Uniﬁ x cubes (Fig ure 8.7). When 
they list all their answers (0  7, 1  6, 2  5, 3  4, 4 
 3, 5  2, 6  1, 7  0), they see a pattern of the ﬁ rst 
number increasing as the second one decreases.
When students list coin combinations for 56 
cents, the solutions that meet a requirement, such 
as one quarter, simplify the task by limiting the pos-
sibilities. A trip to the ice cream store is another situ-
ation for ﬁ nding all the possibilities.
•  If the store sells four ﬂ avors of ice cream and three 
toppings, can every child on the soccer team of 19 
players have a different ice cream sundae?
This problem can be solved with a model, a draw-
ing, or a diagram, as shown in Figure 8.8. In Figure 
8.8a, for example, brown paper squares represent 
chocolate topping on four circles, each representing 
a different ice cream. Ice cream and topping combi-
nations can also be used to illustrate multiplication 
in a Cartesian cross-product (Figure 8.8d).
Activity 8.7 is a target game with Velcro balls. As 
children play the game, they see that each ball has a 
score depending on where it sticks. After playing the 
game, children predict all the possible scores with

three balls. Identifying the high and low scores gives 
boundaries to the possibilities, and a table helps to 
organize the information and show patterns. Pascal’s 
triangle has many applications in mathematics and 
is a good subject for an investigation. In Activity 8.8 
it is used to ﬁ nd several patterns.
Solve a Simpler Problem, or Break the Problem 
into Parts. Some problems are overwhelming be-
cause they appear complex or contain numbers that 
are large. Breaking a complex problem into smaller 
and simpler parts is an important problem-solving 
strategy. Sometimes, substituting smaller numbers 
in a problem helps students understand what is 
going on in the problem. Solving a simpler problem 
gives students a place to start.
Many realistic problems are solved in parts. When 
measuring the area of an irregularly shaped room for 
carpet, students can measure the room in parts and 
add the parts together (Figure 8.9a). The surface area 
of a cereal box (rectangular prism) is found by add-
ing the areas of each face (Fig ure 8.9b).
Many mental computation strategies are based 
on making a more difﬁ cult combination into an 
easier computation. For example, a teacher wants 
students to work on mental computation strategies 
for adding 9’s. If 4,567  999 is too hard as a ﬁ rst ex-
ample, the teacher could start with 47  9. Students 
can ﬁ nd that answer by using a number line and 
counting forward to 56. They can also see that add-
ing 47  10 is easier to compute mentally, but the 
sum has to be corrected by subtracting 1 to get 56. 
Starting with 47  10, 323  100, or 4,567  1,000, 
the pattern of adding an easy number is established 
before working on 47  9, 323  99, or 4,567  999. 
Learning the principle of compensation by adding 
and then subtracting with simple numbers encour-
ages mental computation strategies for addition and 
subtraction in many situations.
Work Backward. Working backward is helpful 
when students know the solution or answer and are 
ﬁ nding its components. Some teachers introduce 
working backward in “known-wanted” problems. 
Students begin with the solution and think about the 
information that would give that result.
•  Edmundo has seven pets that are dogs and cats. 
Five are dogs. How many cats does he have?
Children can model or draw seven pets, identify ﬁ ve 
as dogs, and ﬁ nd that the missing part is two cats. The 
number sentence is a subtraction problem that can 
be written either in addition or subtraction form.

Figure 8.9 Breaking area into smaller parts: (a) area of a room to be carpeted, (b) surface area of a cereal box

A similar process of working backward from the 
known is used in a more complex problem.
•  Chen had $20.00 when he went to the grocery 
store. After buying a chicken for $2.09, celery for 
$0.79, milk for $1.39, and a loaf of bread, he re-
ceived $13.96 in change. Estimate how much the 
bread cost.
Knowing that the total has to be $20, students can 
ﬁ nd several ways to express their thinking.
$14  $20  $2  $1  $1  bread
$2  $1  $1  bread  $14  $20
$20  $14  $2  $1  $1  bread
All the number sentences involve starting with $20 
and backing out the amounts that are known until 
only $2 is left. Another example of solving a similar 
problem and working backward is separating the 
proceeds of a bake sale into two parts.
•  The sixth-grade class at Bayview School sold 
cupcakes at a carnival and collected $50.00. Single 
cupcakes cost 25 cents, and packages of three 
cost 50 cents. The sale of single cupcakes was $30. 
How many cupcakes did the sixth-graders sell?
Total sales  sales of singles 
 sales of packages: 
$50  $30  $20
Each dollar for single 
cupcakes buys four cupcakes: 
30  4  120 cupcakes
Each dollar for packages 
of three buys six cupcakes: 
20  6  120 cupcakes
Single cupcakes  
packaged cupcakes  total: 
120  120  240 cupcakes
In these examples students work backward to 
ﬁ nd the elements that are part of a known total or 
answer. Rush Hour is a challenging spatial puzzle 
that begins with toy cars and trucks in a gridlock. 
Students rearrange toy cars and trucks to undo the 
gridlock and free the red car stuck in trafﬁ c. The dif-
ﬁ culty of the puzzles increases with more vehicles 
in the trafﬁ c jam.
A number puzzle also illustrates working forward 
and backward.
•  Pick a number, triple it, add 3, double the result, 
subtract 6, divide by 3. If Sue’s answer was 12, 
what was her beginning number?
Try several numbers, and see if you ﬁ nd a pat -
tern. Start with 12 and go backward, reversing each 
step.
Undo step 5 
Multiply by 3 12  3 is 36

fewer steps or more complex with larger numbers.

Break Set, or Change Point of View. Creative 
thinking is highly prized in today’s changing world. 
Persistence is an important attribute of good prob-
lem solvers. Problem solvers also need to under-
stand when they have met a dead end. At a dead 
end they have to change their strategy, or how they 
are thinking about the problem.
Being able to break old perceptions and see 
new possibilities has led to many technological and 
practical inventions. The inventor of Post-it Notes 
was working on formulating a new glue and found 
an adhesive that did not work very well. Instead of 
throwing his failure out, he thought how it might be 
useful for temporary cohesion.
Put nine dots on your paper in a 3 
 3 grid. Connect all nine dots with 
four straight lines without lifting your 
pencil from the paper. After several 
attempts, you may agree with others 
that the problem cannot be solved. 
However, when lines extend beyond the visual box 
created by the nine dots, the solution is not difﬁ cult. 
Having permission to try something “outside the 
box” opens up new possibilities. Past experience 
can be helpful or limiting.

Sudoku is a number puzzle that has become popu-
lar. The rule for solving the puzzle is simple: Fill 
each row, column, and nine-square section with the 
numbers 1 through 9. However, the combinations 
are not simple. Look for an easy Sudoku puzzle in 
the newspaper, a book, or on the Internet to work 
with a friend or classmate. Which strategies did you 
use? •••

Being ﬂ exible is less a strategy and more a mind-
set of seeing alternative possibilities. In the number 
puzzles in Figure 8.6, students rearrange the num-
bers several times to get the sums and the order of 
numbers to work. When one answer is correct, stu-
dents resist changing it even when it is necessary to 
solve the entire puzzle.
Children may be less set in their ways of think-
ing and therefore may have less difﬁ culty changing 
their point of view compared with adults, who can 
become ﬁ xed in their thinking. Both children and 
adults need to learn to ask themselves, “Is there an-
other way?” In Figure 8.10 squares are drawn on a 
grid. The ﬁ rst square has an area of 1 unit. The sec-
ond square has an area of 4 units. The challenge is 
to draw other squares with areas of 2 square units, 
3 square units, 4 square units, 5 square units, 6 
square units, 7 square units, 8 square units, and 9

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Implementing a 
Problem-Solving Curriculum
Flexibility of thinking is essential in problem solv-
ing. In the past teachers might present only one way 
to approach a problem or one way to think about it. 
Students who had alternative ideas were frustrated 
and discouraged. Most problems can be solved in 
a variety of ways; learning to use problem-solving 
strategies encourages students to try several ap-
proaches. Even when teachers introduce strategies 
by themselves, students soon learn that the strate-
gies are more powerful when they are used together. 
As children mature, complex problem situations in-
volve a broader range of mathematics topics and 
concepts. Solving a variety of problems in different 
ways develops many skills and attitudes that support 
algebraic thinking.
Many teaching/thinking lessons and informal ac-
tivities that link problem solving to algebra are found 
in the Navigations Through Algebra series (Cuevas 
& Yeatts, 2001; Greenes et al., 2001), in Teaching Chil-
dren Mathematics, on the NCTM website (http://www
.nctm.org), and in supplemental materials from educa-
tional publishers. Good problems are found in many 
resources, including textbooks and supplemental 
materials. Puzzles and games provide many oppor-
tunities for problem solving. Classroom situations 
over the school year also offer many problems that 
students can work together to solve, as discussed in 
Chapter 2.
Teachers who promote thinking and problem 
solving for their students ﬁ nd support in national 
and state standards. Because a problem-based class -
room may look messier or seem noisier than a tradi-
tional classroom, teachers should be proactive with 
principals and parents by explaining the importance 
of problem solving. Parent information sessions or-
ganized by teachers at the ﬁ rst of the year can al-
leviate tension about problem-based mathematics 
curriculum. Parents often want to know that their 
children will learn basic computational skills, and 
teachers can reassure them that computation is an 
important goal. Students need reasons for learning 
the facts and applying them in interesting problems. 
Because the process and answer are both impor-
tant, assessment of problem solving focuses on 
whether students understand a problem, can devise 
a strategy, and can come to a reasonable solution 
that they can explain. Assessment suggestions for 
problem solving are found in Chapter 7.
Newsletters to parents suggest games and activi-
ties for learning facts and for developing mathemati-
cal thinking. At workshops or parents’ mathematics 
nights, students can teach their parents how they 
are solving problems with strategies. Parents expe-
rience problem-solving activities that model how 
students learn mathematics in new ways. Marilyn 
Burns (1994) produced a video for teachers and par-
ents titled What Are You Teaching My Child? which 
describes why problem solving is essential for all 
students and how it is used in real life (the video 
is available at http://www.mathsolutions.com/mb/content/
publications). The videotape also shows the modern 
elementary classroom and why it looks different 
from the classroom that many parents remember.

Take-Home Activities
Dear Parents,
We have been working with pattern blocks and solving number problems 
with them. Your student has a zipper bag with 20 pattern blocks in it. The 
small green triangles are worth 1 point, the blue parallelograms are worth 
2 points, the red trapezoids are worth 3 points, and the yellow hexagons are 
worth 6 points. Using the pattern blocks, you and your child can solve the 
following problems:
 •  Make a turtle with the pattern blocks. Write a number sentence showing 
the total value of the blocks you used.
 •  Make a model of something using pattern blocks that has a value of 26 
points. Trace around the picture and write the number sentence you used.
 •  Make a pattern with the pattern blocks using red and blue blocks. Read 
the pattern.
 •  Show four combinations of blocks with a total value of 18 points.
After solving these problems, see if you can make up other problems using 
the pattern blocks.
Sincerely,

134

Dear Parents,
How do students spend their time? We are investigating this question and ask-
ing students to keep a log of their activities one day this week. Using a daily 
schedule, students mark which activity is most important in each half hour. 
One copy of the schedule is for midnight to noon, and another is for activi-
ties from noon until midnight. After collecting this information, we will make 
circle graphs and compare the amount of time students spend on different 
activities.

Summary
Problem solving has been the focus of instruction in el-
ementary education for several decades. Students act 
as mathematicians as they discover and reﬁ ne concepts 
and procedures needed to solve a variety of problems. 
Problem solving also involves process skills of reason-
ing, connecting, communicating, and representing math-
ematical ideas. Creative and critical thinking skills are 
important attributes for working in the technologically 
demanding world of the twenty-ﬁ rst century.
Learning processes and strategies for solving prob-
lems begins in elementary school and continues through 
secondary education. The problem-solving process 
suggested by George Polya leads elementary students 
through four steps: understand, plan, carry out the plan, 
and check to see if the solution is appropriate and sen-
sible. Development of problem-solving strategies, such 
as ﬁ nding and using patterns, guessing and checking, 
breaking a problem into smaller parts, or making a table 
or graph, provides students with tools that apply to differ-
ent problems, often in conjunction with each other.
Teachers have several responsibilities for building 
an environment that encourages ﬂ exibility of thinking. 
They need to choose worthwhile and interesting math-
ematical tasks that interest children. Many classroom 
and interdisciplinary situations are good problem-solv-
ing tasks. Games, puzzles, and informal activities also 
develop problem-solving skills and attitudes. When 
teachers recognize how algebra is embedded in many 
problem-solving situations, they can help students grow 
in their understanding and skill in algebra.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Which of the 11 problem-solving strategies have you 
used? Which strategies do you think are most impor-
tant? Why?
 2.  What is your understanding of teaching via problem 
solving? What do you need to do to become more 
skilled at this approach?
 3.  Find ﬁ ve problems for students at a grade level of 
your interest in resource books, in teacher’s manu-
als, and on the Internet. Solve them and analyze 
your thinking. Which strategies did you use in solv-
ing the problems? Share your problems with fellow 
students to build a ﬁ le of classroom problems.
 4.  How do you interpret the following statement: “A 
good problem solver knows what to do when he or 
she doesn’t know what to do.”

Developing 
Concepts 
of Number
earning about numbers, numerals, and number systems is a 
major focus of elementary mathematics. Children’s number 
sense and knowledge of number begin through match-
ing, comparing, sorting, ordering, and counting sets 
of objects. Rote and rational counting are important 
milestones in the development of number. Number is 
represented in stories, songs, and rhymes and with concrete objects and 
numerals. As students count beyond 9, they encounter the base-10 numera-
tion system used for larger numbers. They also explore number patterns in 
the base-10 number system through 100 using a variety of experiences and 
activities in the classroom.

CHAPTER 9

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Numbers and counting probably emerged from 
practical needs to record and remember informa-
tion about commerce and livestock. Today, num-
bers are used in many ways, but the basic utilitarian 
nature is the same. Accountants and bankers track 
and manage millions of dollars around the globe; 
social and natural scientists research population 
trends and topics in medicine, physics, or chemis-
try using computers; computer programmers and 
analysts manipulate numbers and symbols to de-
velop new languages and applications. In daily life 
families track income and expenses. Counting and 
number development start early in life. Children use 
numbers naturally as they play games, sing songs, 
read picture books, and solve problems. The NCTM 
standards for algebra include basic thinking skills of 
classifying, sequencing, and patterning. Such skills 
are also fundamental for the development of num-
ber concepts.
NCTM Standards for Number 
and Operations
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 
2 should enable all students to:
Understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, rela-
tionships among numbers, and number systems
Understand meanings of operations and how they relate 
to one another
Compute ﬂ uently and make reasonable estimates
Pre-K– 2 Expectations:
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  count with understanding and recognize “how many” in 
sets of objects;
•  use multiple models to develop initial understandings of 
place value and the base-ten number system;
•  develop understanding of the relative position and mag-
nitude of whole numbers and of ordinal and cardinal 
numbers and their connections;
•  develop a sense of whole numbers and represent and use 
them in ﬂ exible ways, including relating, composing, and 
decomposing numbers;
•  connect number words and numerals to the quanti-
ties they represent, using various physical models and 
representations.
NCTM Standard for Algebra
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 
2 should enable all students to:
Understand patterns, relations, and functions
Represent and analyze mathematical situations and struc-
tures using algebraic symbols
Use mathematical models to represent and understand 
quantitative relationships
Analyze change in various contexts
Pre-K– 2 Expectations:
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  sort, classify, and order objects by size, number, and other 
properties;
•  recognize, describe, and extend patterns such as se-
quences of sounds and shapes or simple numeric patterns 
and translate from one representation to another.
Primary Thinking-Learning Skills
Thinking-learning skills appear to be innate in hu-
mans. Brain research shows that infants actively 
make sense of their world. Thinking-learning skills 
provide a foundation for all cognitive learning, in-
cluding development of numbers and number oper-
ations. Three skills are discussed in this chapter, and 
patterning is developed more fully in Chapter 16:
•  Matching and discriminating, comparing and 
contrasting
•  Classifying, sorting, and grouping
•  Ordering, sequence, and seriation
Matching and Discriminating, 
Comparing and Contrasting
When children match and compare, they ﬁ nd simi-
lar attributes. Discriminating and contrasting involve 
identifying dissimilar attributes. Infants respond dif-
ferently to familiar or unfamiliar faces, sounds, and 
smells. They gaze at pictures resembling faces and 
avoid pictures showing scrambled face parts. Rec-
ognizing similarities and differences can often oc-
cur simultaneously, such as when children match 
the mare with the colt, the cow with the calf, and the 
bear with the cub; children see the relationship be-
tween the adult and young animals at the same time 
they recognize the differences. Matching begins with 
the relationship between two objects. Relationships 
can be physical (large red triangle to large red tri-
angle), show related purpose (pencil with ballpoint 
pen, key with lock, or shoe with sock), or connect 
by meaning (a cow with the word cow).
Learning activities based on similarities and dif-
ferences extend from early childhood through high 
school and were found by Marzano (2003) to be 
the most effective teaching strategy for increasing 
student achievement. In the primary grades many 
games are based on ﬁ nding similarities and differ-
ences. Lotto games have many variations; children 

 
Chapter 9 Developing Concepts of Number 
139
might match a red ap-
ple with a green apple; 
a calf with a cow; three 
oranges with three ap-
ples; or three oranges 
with the numeral 3. A 
teacher can place sev-
eral objects in the feel-
ing box (Figure 9.1) and 
suggest matching and 
discriminating 
tasks 
for students. Later, chil-
dren can bring objects 
for the feeling box and 
create similar tasks for 
classmates.
Children 
develop 
matching 
and 
dis-
criminating skills and 
comparing and con-
trasting skills through a variety of experiences and 
activities.
A teacher can adapt an activity from Sesame Street
with four objects so that “one of these things is not 
like the others” (Figure 9.2). Drawings of ﬁ ve clowns 
are almost identical in Figure 9.3, but each one has 
a distinguishing characteristic for children to ﬁ nd. 
Other search puzzles may show hidden objects or 
ask which picture is different.
Card games, such as Go Fish and Crazy Eights 
and Uno, match and discriminate by number, color, 
or suit. In the game Set, each card has four attributes: 
number, color, shape, and shading. Students make 
“sets” of three cards (Figure 9.4) that match on each 
attribute or differ on the attributes. Children match 
objects to shape outlines in Activity 9.1. In Activity 
9.2, children explore bolts, nuts, and washers and 
ﬁ nd which ones match.
Matching and discriminating tasks are found 
in other subject areas. In language and literature, 
metaphors and similes express comparisons and 
contrasts.

•  Show one-half in six different ways with objects, 
pictures, and symbols.
Classifying
Classiﬁ cation, also called sorting or grouping or 
categorizing, extends matching two objects that 
are similar to matching groups of objects that share 
common characteristics, or attributes. Classiﬁ cation 
is an important skill in all subject areas. In science 
children sort objects that sink or ﬂ oat and objects that 
are living or nonliving. Groupings of tree leaves and 
animals are based on similarities and differences. 
In reading children ﬁ nd words that rhyme, have the 
same initial consonants, or have long vowel versus 
short vowel sounds. They use classes of letters called 
consonants and vowels that have different uses and 
sounds and ﬁ nd that classiﬁ cation systems can have 
exceptions. Identifying needs and characteristics of 
people around the world is a core concept in so-
cial studies. People living in different places have 
unique languages, art, and music, but they all ex-
hibit these cultural characteristics in some way. All 
peoples have a staple food that is cooked, mashed, 
and eaten with other foods, whether that staple is 
rice, wheat, corn, or taro root. The commonalities 
help children understand the similarities and differ-
ences among cultures.
has attached a label to a group of furry, four-legged 
animals. When an adult replies, “Spot is a dog. He 
barks,” or “Spot is bigger than cats,” the child begins 
to form two classes of animals that are small, furry, 
and four-legged. A broader classiﬁ cation system is 
developed as children learn about a variety of other 
animals with different attributes. Elephants have 
four legs but are large and have a trunk. Gradually 
children develop a schema, or understanding, of the 
attributes that deﬁ ne speciﬁ c animals and describe 
complex relationships between different animals. 
They are able to group animals in many ways: size, 
type of skin covering, what they eat, where they live, 
sounds they make, and many other ways to orga-
nize animals by their characteristics. This ability to 
create ﬂ exible and complex classiﬁ cation systems is 
critical for conceptual learning.
Consistent classiﬁ cation develops over time and 
with experience. When the child lines up a red shoe, 
a green shoe, a green car, a police car, a police of-
ﬁ cer, and a ﬁ reﬁ ghter, the thinking behind the sort-
ing may not be obvious (Figure 9.5). By listening, a 
teacher may hear the child “chain” the objects rather 
than classify: “Red shoe goes with a green shoe, a 
green shoe goes with a green car, a green car goes 
with a police car.” Attribute blocks emphasize sim-
ple classiﬁ cations by color, shape, size, thickness, 
or texture or two-way classiﬁ cation. Real-life objects 
are typically more complex in the ways they can be 
organized because they have many attributes.
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
Different cultures have a food staple made of a grain (e.g., 
wheat, rice, quinoa, or corn) or a root vegetable (e.g., potato 
or taro). Ask parents of students from different cultures 
to demonstrate how they cook the staple into a bread or 
porridge. Students can develop a Venn diagram of how the 
different foods are alike and different.
123
Figure 9.5 Chaining objects
As students become more sophisticated in classi-
ﬁ cations, simple classes give way to complex classi-
ﬁ cations. Calling “kitty” demonstrates that the child 
Children may sort buttons by size (big, medium, 
small), texture (rough, smooth), color, number of 
holes, and material, as well as not-button. They also 
see that buttons have more than one attribute. The 
big red button is big and red and belongs to two 
classes at the same time. The double-classiﬁ ca-
tion board in Figure 9.6 challenges students to ﬁ nd 
two characteristics at the same time. Sorting boxes 
contain collections of objects, such as plastic ﬁ sh-
ing worms, washers of various sizes, assorted keys, 
small plastic toys, buttons, plastic jar lids, and other 
common items. These collections provide many 

142 
Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
experiences for sorting objects by different attri-
butes: color, shape, material, letters on them, and so 
on. Activity 9.3 demonstrates students’ classiﬁ cation 
skills with collections of objects.

are essential for a chair? Why is a sofa or stool 
not a chair? What attributes keep them from

ing the relationships between different types

Ordering, Sequence, and Seriation
Another basic thinking-learning skill involves ﬁ nd-
ing and using the orderly arrangements of objects, 
events, and ideas. Order has a beginning, a middle, 
and an end, but placement within the order can be 
arbitrary. When threading beads on string, children 
may put a red bead ﬁ rst, a yellow bead second, and 
a green bead last, but they could easily rearrange 
the beads. Juan could be at the ﬁ rst, middle, or end 
of the lunch line. In sequence, order has meaning. 
Days of the weeks have ﬁ xed sequence, but the class-
room schedule may vary from day to day depending 
on special events. Calendars mark the passage of

and extend thinking. “Are there enough shirts for all the 
pants?” “Are there enough washers for all the bolts?” 
“Do you have enough garages for all the trucks?” “Which 
shells do you like best? Why?” “I see three big dinosaurs.” 
“I see two blue cars and three green trucks.”

With older children the same skills can be developed with 
other materials or examples: names of the 25 largest cities 
in the United States, rainfall in the 25 largest cities in the 
United States, rivers and their lengths, cards with zoo 
animals, examples of different kinds of rocks.

sequence of historical events, geological periods, 
or presidents. The sequence of events in a story 
provides structure for the plot. Drawings of plant 
growth show the sequence in development. Seria-
tion is an arrangement based on gradual changes 
of an attribute and is often used in measurement. 
For example:
•  Children line up from shortest to tallest.
•  Red paint tiles are arranged from lightest to 
darkest.
•  Bolts, nuts, and washers go from the largest to the 
smallest in diameter.
•  Each stack of blocks has one more block in it 
than the last one.
Comparative vocabulary develops with seriation: 
good, better, best; big, medium, small; lightest, light, 
heavy, heaviest; lightest, light, dark, darkest. Activ-
ity 9.4 describes comparison of length with drinking 
straws.
Games follow a sequence of turns and rules; most 
board games are based on roll, move, and take the 
consequences, as in Activity 9.5.
Beginning Number Concepts
Experiences with matching, discriminating, classify-
ing, sequencing, and seriating are important skills 
needed for development of number concepts. Ob-
jects can be classiﬁ ed by size, color, or shape, but 
they can also be sorted by the number of objects: 
ﬁ ve apples, ﬁ ve cars, ﬁ ve pencils. “Five” or the idea 
of “ﬁ veness” is the common characteristic. Number 
is an abstract concept rather than a physical char-
acteristic; it cannot be touched, but it can be repre-
sented by the objects.
Order, sequence, and seriation also play a role in 
number concept. Counting is a sequence of words 
related to increasing number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. . . . Chil-
dren learning to count may say numbers out of order 
or have limited connection between a number word 
and its value. An adult asks, “How old are you?” The 
toddler responds with three ﬁ ngers and says “two.” 
With more counting experience, children recognize 
number in many forms: objects in a set, spoken 
words, and written symbols.
Beginning number concepts are a major focus in 
early childhood because they are the foundation for

Drawing Straws (Reasoning)
Level: Grades K– 3
Setting: Learning center
Objective: Students compare and seriate objects by length.
Materials: Five or six straws or dowels cut into different lengths
•  Make a format board by tracing the straws or dowels in a 
row from the shortest to the longest on poster board.
•  Put the straws or dowels into a box. Have students draw 
straws or dowel pieces and place them on the board.
Variations
•  Have students arrange straws from smallest to largest 
without the board.
•  Make a board with only a few lengths of straws drawn 
on it. Children take turns picking out straws. They can 
choose straws that match the lengths, or they can place 
shorter straws or longer lengths in the correct positions 
between those drawn.
•  Make a board on which the lengths are marked at 
random.

understanding the Hindu-Arabic numeration system 
and number operations. Although numbers up to 10, 
20, or even 100 may seem simple to adults, number 
concepts and number sense are important cognitive 
goals for young children. Teachers and other adults 
encourage numerical thinking through the activities 
and conversations about number.
The Hindu-Arabic numeration system is a 
base-10 system that developed in Asia and the Middle 
East. As early as A.D. 600, a Hindu numeration system 
in India was based on place value. The forerunners 
of numeric symbols used today appeared about 
A.D. 700. Persian scholars translated science and 
mathematics ideas from Greece, India, and else-
where into their language. The Arabic association 
with the system came from translation and trans-
mission to other parts of the world. The Book of al-
Khowarazmi on Hindu Number explained the use of 
Hindu numerals. The word algorithm comes from 
the author’s name, al-Khowarazmi; algorithms are 
the step-by-step procedures used to compute with 
numbers (Johnson, 1999). Increased trade between 
Asia and Europe and the Moorish conquest of Spain 
further spread the Hindu-Arabic numeration system 
across the Mediterranean into Europe. The Hindu-
Arabic system gradually replaced Roman numerals 
and the abacus for trade and commerce in Europe. 
For a brief time the two systems coexisted, but even-
tually the algorists, who computed with the new 
system, won out over the abacists. By the 16th cen-
tury the Hindu-Arabic system was predominant, as 
people recognized its advantages for computation.
Five characteristics of the Hindu-Arabic system 
make possible compact notation and efﬁ cient com-
putational processes:
1.  Ten is the base number. During early counting, 
people undoubtedly used ﬁ ngers to keep track 
of the count. After all ﬁ ngers were used, they 
needed a supplemental means for keeping track. 
A grouping based on 10, the number of ﬁ ngers 
available, was natural.
2.  Ten symbols—0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9—are the 
numerals in the system.
3.  The number value of a numeral is determined by 
the counting value and the position: The nu-
meral 2 has different values in different positions 
of 2, 20, and 200. Place value is based on pow-

Follow the Rules (Problem Solving)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students develop a sequence of attribute blocks that 
follow a change rule.
Materials: Attribute materials or a set of objects with at least three 
attributes, transparency attribute blocks
•  Make a game board such as the one shown.
•  The arrows represent rules for changing the shapes in the 
rectangles:
→  Change one attribute (a big red rough square to a 
small red rough square)
⇒  Change two attributes (a big red rough square to a 
small red rough circle)
•  Display a pattern on the overhead using transparency at-
tribute blocks. Each block differs in one attribute from the 
previous attribute block.
•  Ask students which blocks they can ﬁ nd to continue the 
sequence.
•  Distribute a set of attribute blocks to each group. Most 
sets of 32 attribute blocks have four shapes in four colors 
of two sizes.
•  Have children put a shape in the Start box and follow the 
rules to the Stop box.
•  Ask them to start with a different block and show the 
same sequence rule—one attribute changes.
Variation
Older students can make a sequence that has a “two at-
tributes change” rule.

ers of 10 and is called a decimal system. The 
starting position is called the units or ones place. 
Positions to the left of the ones place increase by 
powers of 10.

 A decimal point signiﬁ es that the numbers to the 
left are whole numbers and that the numbers to 
the right are decimal fractions. From any place 
in the system, the next position to the left is 10 
times greater and the next position to the right 
is one-tenth as large. This characteristic makes 
it possible to represent whole numbers of any 
size as well as decimal fractions with the system. 
The metric system for measurement and the U.S. 
monetary system are also decimal systems.
4.  Having zero distinguishes the Hindu-Arabic 
system from many other numeration systems 
and allows compact representation of large 
numbers. A zero symbol in early Mayan writings 
also has been documented. The term zero is 
derived from the Hindu word for “empty.” Zero is 
the number associated to a set with no objects, 
called the empty set. Zero is also a placeholder 
in the place-value system. In the numeral 302, 0 
holds the place between 3 and 2 and indicates 
no tens. Finally, 0 represents multiplication by 
the base number 10 so that 300 is 3  10  10.
5.  Computation with the Hindu-Arabic system is 
relatively simple as a result of algorithms devel-
oped for addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. Algorithms are step-by-step cal-
culation procedures that are easy to record. Al-
though most people learn a single algorithm for 
each operation, several algorithms are discussed 
in Chapter 12.
Children begin learning about the Hindu-Arabic 
system by counting objects and recording numerals. 
Throughout the elementary years they learn about 
the place-value system and computational strategies 
that the system makes possible.
Number Types and Their Uses
Numbers have three main uses: to name or desig-
nate; to identify where objects and events are in 
sequence; and to enumerate, or count, sets (Fig -
ure 9.7). Identiﬁ cation numbers or numbers on foot-
ball jerseys and hotel rooms are nominal because 
they are used to identify or name, although they 
may code other information. Single digits on foot-
ball uniforms may indicate players in the backﬁ eld. 
A room number of 1523 may be the 23rd room on 
the 15th ﬂ oor or the 23rd room on the 5th ﬂ oor of 
the ﬁ rst tower. Automobile license tags are identify-
ing numbers that may also code information such as 
county of residence.
Ordinal numbers designate location in a 
sequence:
•  Evan is ﬁ rst in line; Kelly is last.
•  Tuesday is the seventh day of school.
•  Toni ate the ﬁ rst and fourth pieces of cheese in 
the package.
Cardinal numbers are counting numbers be-
cause they tell how many objects are in a set. Number

describes an abstract property of every set from 1 
to millions.
•  Ishmael has 1 dog. Tandra has 2 cats. Nguyen has 
3 goldﬁ sh.
•  We counted 23 cars, 8 pickup trucks, and 12 vans 
and sport utility vehicles in the parking lot.
•  The distance to the moon ranges between 
356,000 kilometers and 406,000 kilometers.
•  The movie Pirates of the Caribbean earned more 
than $600 million at the box ofﬁ ce.
Written symbols for numbers are numerals; 19 is 
the numeral for a counted set of 19 objects.
Children use nominal, ordinal, and cardinal 
numbers from an early age. They learn addresses 
and telephone numbers that are identiﬁ ed with 
particular people. They know what ﬁ rst and second 
mean when they run races from one end of the play-
ground to the other. By singing counting songs and 
reading counting books and through many other 
experiences, children construct a comprehensive 
understanding of numbers, their many uses, and the 
words and symbols that represent them.
Counting and Early 
Number Concepts
The growth of children’s understanding of num-
ber is so subtle that it may escape notice. Children 
younger than 2 years of age have acquired some idea 
of “more,” usually in connection with food—more 
cookies or a bigger glass of juice. Counting words are 
heard in the talk of 2- and 3-year-old children. When 
young children hold up three ﬁ ngers to show age, 
they are performing a taught behavior rather than 
understanding what “three” means. They repeat a 
verbal chain of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 that receives approval 
and attention from adults. Some children count up 
to 10, 20, or 100 using memorized verbal chains, al-
though the meaning behind the words may not have 
developed.
Early number work involves oral language. Num-
ber rhymes, songs, and ﬁ nger-play activities stimu-
late children’s enjoyment of number language and 
support the connection of number words with num-
ber ideas. Through rhythm, rhyme, and action chil-
dren associate counting words with their meanings. 
Books of ﬁ nger plays and poems for young children 
include many counting and number ideas. “Five 
Little Monkeys” is a counting-down favorite that ap-
pears in song and story versions. Each verse has 
one fewer monkey jumping on the bed, illustrating 
counting down or backwards.
Many counting and number books invite count-
ing aloud. Some involve puzzles and problems for 
students to solve through counting. Eve Merriam’s 
text and Bernie Karlin’s illustrations in 12 Ways to 
Get to 11 build a subtle message about number con-
stancy. On each two-page spread the number 11 is 
represented in different situations and different ar-
rangements. As a follow-up, children could make 
boxes for the numbers 11 through 19 and ﬁ ll them 
with different objects each day for several weeks. 
Activity 9.6 describes an activity using Anno’s Count-
ing Book.
Children’s literature promotes understanding of 
mathematical concepts in situations and stories that 
relate to children. Number books, counting books, 
and number concept books have many advantages 
for teachers and children (National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics, 1994, p. 171):
•  Children’s literature furnishes a meaningful 
context for mathematics.
•  Children’s literature celebrates mathemat-
ics as a language.
•  Children’s literature integrates mathematics 
into current themes of study.
•  Children’s literature supports the art of 
problem posing.
Counting and number concept books are listed 
at the end of this chapter in the Children’s Book-
shelf section. Bibliographies found on the Internet, 
such as http://www.geocities.com/heartland/estates/4967/
math.html, contain a wide variety of mathematical 
books on counting, number, and other mathemati-
cal concepts.
Rote counting is a memorized list of number 
words. The verbal chain of 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . provides 
prior knowledge for number concepts. Rational 
counting, or meaningful counting, begins when 
children connect number words to objects, such as 
apples, blocks, toy cars, or ﬁ ngers. Three becomes 
a meaningful label for the number of red trucks or 
bears or mice or candles on the cake. Counting is a 
complex cognitive task requiring ﬁ ve counting prin-

ciples, which were identiﬁ ed by Rachel Gelman and 
C. R. Gallistel (1978, pp. 131– 135):
1.  The abstraction principle states that any collec-
tion of real or imagined objects can be counted.
2.  The stable-order principle means that counting 
numbers are arranged in a sequence that does 
not change.
3.  The one-to-one principle requires ticking off the 
items in a set so that one and only one number is 
used for each item counted.
4.  The order-irrelevance principle states that the or-
der in which items are counted is irrelevant. The 
number stays the same regardless of the order.
5.  The cardinal principle gives special signiﬁ cance 
to the last number counted because it is not only 
associated with the last item but also represents 
the total number of items in the set. The cardinal 
number tells how many are in the set.
Through counting objects and interactions with 
adults and peers, children begin to understand the 
pattern of numbers and their names: 1-more-than-1 is 
two, 1-more-than-2 or 2-more-than-1 is three, and so 
on. Numbers are developed progressively with con-
crete materials: 1 through 5, followed by 1 through 
10, then 1 through 20. Stress the last or cardinal num-
ber of a set as objects are counted: “One, two, three, 
four, ﬁ ve,” then ask questions such as “What is the 
last number you counted?” or “How many cars did 
you count?” A commercial number chart, or one 
made by the children, demonstrates the “one more” 
idea between counting numbers, as shown in Fig  -
ure 9.8. Counting sets aloud connects the sequence

Counting with Anno
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students relate number to counting.
Materials: Anno’s Counting Book, by Mitsumasa Anno (New York: 
HarperCollins Children’s Books, 1977), Uniﬁ x cubes
Anno’s Counting Book engages children in counting from 
0 to 12 in a series of pages that depict the development 
of a community over seasonal changes. This wordless 
book invites children to develop understanding of the 
numbers 0 through 12. An almost blank page shows 
a winter snow scene that introduces zero. Each page 
displays more objects to count. As the spring thaw sets 
in, children see two trees, two rabbits, two children, two 
trucks, two men, two logs, two chimneys.
Each page shows progressively more complex illustra-
tions that require a more intense search for numbers. On 
each page a set of blocks illustrates the number featured 
in the illustration.
•  Show the book through the ﬁ rst time without interrup-
tion. Have the students look at each picture.
•  The second time through, ask students what they notice 
about each page. Model counting, and have students 
count with you or by themselves.
•  Place the book and Uniﬁ x cubes at a reading station. Ask 
students to match a number of cubes with the pictures.
•  Assign different numbers to groups of two or three, and 
let students make posters using stickers.
•  Have individuals or small groups write stories about the 
posters or list what they ﬁ nd on a page.
Extension
•  Use the book to introduce multiples and skip counting.

of numbers and the objects, as shown in Activity 9.7. 
Activities with manipulative materials demonstrate 
numbers created in different ways so that children 
become ﬂ exible in their ideas about number (see 
Activities 9.8 and 9.9).
Listening to children count shows whether 
students have learned the sequence of numbers. 
By counting objects, children coordinate number 
words with objects one to one. Conservation of 
number, or constancy of number, indicates an un-
derstanding that the number property of a set re-
mains constant even when objects are rearranged, 
spread out, separated into subsets, or crowded to-
gether. Without number constancy children may 
count two sets of six objects but believe that one set 
is larger because it looks longer or more dense or 
more spread out.
Zero requires special attention because children 
may not have encountered it as a number word. How-
ever, children have had experiences with “all gone” 
and “no more” that can be used to introduce zero. 
In Activity 9.10 sorting objects into color groups and 
story situations illustrates zero, or the empty set.
Number Constancy
By using Piaget’s conservation of number task, 
teachers can assess a child’s level of number under-
standing and skill as preconserver, transitional, or 
conserver (Piaget, 1952). Adults who are not familiar 
with this task are usually surprised at children’s an-
swers to what appears to be a simple task. However, 
the development of number constancy, or conserva-
tion, is a critical cognitive milestone. Without num-
ber constancy or number permanence, work with 
larger numbers, place value, operations, symbols, 
and number sense is difﬁ cult or impossible. Most 
students develop number understanding at about 
5 or 6 years of age because they have sufﬁ cient

Number Conservation (Assessment Activity and Reasoning)
Level: Grades K– 2 (can also be used diagnostically with older 
children experiencing problems with number concepts)
Setting: Individual
Objective: Students demonstrate number conservation.
Materials: Red and black checkers, 5– 10 of each color
An interview for conservation, or constancy, of num-
ber determines whether a child can hold the abstract 
concept of number even when objects are rearranged. 
This protocol is for individual assessment. The interviewer 
should refrain from teaching at this time. The purpose is 
developmental assessment.
Step 1. Establish that the two sets or quantities are equiv-
alent. Put seven red checkers and seven black checkers in 
parallel rows so that the one-to-one correspondence be-
tween the rows is obvious. Say: “I have some red checkers 
and some black checkers. Do I have the same number of 
red checkers and black checkers?”
If the child does not recognize that the number of 
checkers is the same in both rows, the interview is over. 
The child does not conserve number yet or does not 
understand the task. If the child responds that the num-
ber of red and black checkers is the same, the interview 
continues.
Step 2. Transform one of the sets or objects. The teacher 
changes the arrangement of one of the rows by push-
ing the checkers closer together, spreading them out, or 
clustering them as a group. The rearrangement is done in 
full view of the child.
Step 3. Ask whether the two sets or quantities are still 
equivalent. “Look at the checkers now. Are there more 
checkers here (pointing to the top row), more checkers 
here (pointing to the bottom row), or is the number of 
checkers the same?” The student may respond “more 
red,” “more black,” or “the same.” Sometimes the stu-
dent is confused or does not answer.
Step 4. Probe for the child’s reasoning. This is the most 
important part of the interview because it reveals how 
the child is thinking. “How did you know that the number 
of black checkers was more (or that the number of red 
checkers was more or that the number of red and black 
checkers was the same)?”
Step 5. Determine the level of reasoning on the task. 
Based on the child’s answer, determine the level of 
conservation.
Preconserver: Child does not yet recognize equivalence 
of the sets. Some may not even understand what the 
question is or may not have the vocabulary to under-
stand the situation.
Transitional: Child recognizes equivalence in parallel 
lines but is confused when the sets are rearranged. 
These children look intently at the checkers and think 
out loud: “I thought they were the same, but now they 
look different.” “They aren’t the same anymore, but 
they used to be.” “They look different, but they are the 
same.” Wavering between different and same is typical 
of the transitional learner.
Conserver: Child recognizes, often immediately, that 
the two sets were equivalent and are still equivalent 
regardless of the arrangement. When asked to explain 
why the two are the same, their reasoning may vary, 
but students who conserve number are absolutely sure 
about their answer.
mental maturity and have had appropriate experi-
ences with objects and language. Teachers and par-
ents of young children may be tempted to “teach” 
children the right answer to the conservation task. 
The ability to conserve is not learned directly but is 
constructed through interactions with objects and 
people as well as through mental maturation. Within 
a short time a student may move from preconserver 
to transitional to conserver through his or her own 
reasoning and understanding process.
Piaget developed assessment interviews on 
many concepts in mathematics: number, length, 
area, time, mass, and liquid volume. Although ma-
terials change for each concept, the steps of the in-

 
Chapter 9 Developing Concepts of Number 
151
the same number or different, the teacher asks for 
their reasoning. Some children recount the sets of 
checkers or rearrange them. Others reply that “none 
were added, none were taken away”; their reasoning 
is more abstract. Transitional students are puzzled 
by the task because they are not sure whether the 
number is the same or different. Some children offer 
no reason for their answer.
Children move through the concrete operational 
stage during the elementary years as they develop 
constancy of length, area, volume, elapsed time, 
mass, and other concepts. Piaget’s structured inter-
view is a good model for assessment of any mathe-
matics content: student engagement with a speciﬁ c 
assessment task, followed by questions to discover 
the child’s thinking.
Teachers who focus on student thinking design 
concrete experiences and avoid abstractions and 
symbolizations too early. Throughout elementary 
school, children need objects as aids in their think-
ing because abstract thinking begins only around 
ages 11 to 13 and develops slowly into adulthood. 
Manipulatives in mathematics are objects to think 
about. Also, adults often use concrete materials and 
models to help children learn about new ideas and 
solve problems.
Linking Number and Numeral
Many experiences with manipulative and real ob-
jects, games, computer software, books, songs, and 
conversation develop number concepts and skills. 
Children who enter preschool and kindergarten with 
meager informal number and counting experiences 
or limited English language proﬁ ciency need ex-
tended time and varied experiences. Unfortunately, 
children who need additional oral language and con-
crete experiences are sometimes rushed into sym-
bolic experiences without sufﬁ cient background.
As children gain proﬁ ciency with verbal and 
physical representations of number, they also en-
counter the written symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
matched with sets. Uniﬁ x number boats and num-
ber indicators, shown in Figure 9.9, structure con-
necting number to numeral because the number 
of blocks inside the boat matches the numeral. 
Uniﬁ x number indicators ﬁ t on any tower of cubes, 
so children must determine which indicator goes 
with which tower. Peg number puzzles, another 
structured material, show the numeral with the cor-
rect number of peg holes. Students ﬁ ll up the puzzle 
for each number and then put the num bers together 
in correct numerical order, as shown in Figure 9.10.
Children also develop mental images of num-
bers. After working with dice, dominoes, and cards, 
children develop a strong visual image for number 
that they recognize without counting the dots or 
pips. This ability is called subitizing and shows a 
growing sophistication with number. Students soon 
call out the numbers while playing board games 
and connect the number with the action. A number 
line is a spatial, or graphic, arrangement of counting 
numbers (Figure 9.11). The number line introduces

Plate Puzzles and Cup Puzzles (Representation)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Learning center
Objective: Students connect sets with numerals.
Materials: Paper plates, scissors, paper cups
•  Make puzzles out of paper plates. Cut each paper plate so 
that it has a distinct conﬁ guration.
•  On one piece of the plate, write a numeral; on the other 
piece, draw a picture or put stickers corresponding to the 
numeral.
•  Write a numeral on an inverted paper cup. Use golf tees 
to punch the corresponding number of holes in the bot-
tom of the cup. Children ﬁ t the correct number of tees 
into the holes in the cup.
•  Have children make their own cup and plate puzzles.

Matching Numeral and Set Cards
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Learning center
Objective: Students match sets with numerals.
Materials: Pocket chart and sets of cards for matching
A pocket chart can be used in many ways. If made 
with library pockets on a poster board strip, it makes 
a learning center that can sit on the chalk tray. At ﬁ rst, 
the matches made are simple, but the variations suggest 
many ways of extending the use of the pocket chart.
•  Put cards that have pictures of sets on them in the 
pockets for 0– 9 or 1– 10. Pictures or stickers can be used. 
Children can also be given the task of making additional 
sets of cards.
•  Put a set of picture cards in the pockets. Ask students to 
match with other picture cards or with numeral cards.
•  If students need more clues, the cards can match by color 
as well as by number. Additional sets should not have the 
color cues.
Variations
•  Reverse the order of the sets, or mix up the order of the 
sets.
•  Add a set of number words to match to the sets and the 
numerals.
•  Add a set of addition cards (5  1) and subtraction cards 
(4  3) to match the numbers.
•  The pocket chart can be used later as a place-value chart 
for large numbers.

the idea of counting up by walking forward on the 
number line. Students can also count down by walk-
ing backward or turning around. Counting up with 
objects or on the number line connects counting to 
addition and subtraction.
Games and puzzles are informal activities that 
are introduced and placed in learning centers as 
exploratory and independent activities. Activity 9.12 
shows simple puzzles to match sets with numerals. 
In Activity 9.13 picture cards are matched with ap-
propriate numeral cards. Activity 9.14 is a concentra-
tion game for matching numerals and sets.

Writing Numerals
Writing names and numerals is a major achieve-
ment that gives children more independence in 
recording their mathematical ideas. Number work 
does not have to be delayed until children can write. 
Numeral cards allow children to label sets and se-
quence numbers. Children usually have developed 
many number concepts and can recognize many 
numerals before they can write them. They may also 
type or use a computer mouse to select numerals 
without controlling a pencil.
When handwriting instruction begins, correct 
form is modeled by the teacher and in the materi-
als used. Students trace over dotted or lightly drawn 
numerals to build their proﬁ ciency. Children who 
write numerals correctly and neatly during writing 
practice sessions may be less careful at other times. 
A chart showing the formation of numerals can be 
posted on the wall, or a writing strip of letters and 
numerals can be placed at the top of each desk. Dif-
ferent schools adopt different handwriting systems,

Card Games for Numbers and Numerals
Level: Grades K– 4
Setting: Learning center
Objective: Students match numerals and sets.
Materials: Sets of playing cards or index cards with stickers on 
them
Concentration
•  Make a set of 10 index cards with 1 to 10 stickers on 
them and another 10 cards with the numerals 1 to 10 on 
them. Arrange the cards face down in a 4  5 array.
•  A child turns over two cards at a time.
•  When a match is made between number and numeral, 
the child keeps the two cards. If there is not a match, the 
cards are returned to their places face down, and the next 
child turns over a pair.
Variations
•  Match two sets of numeral cards.
•  Pick a target number, and turn over combinations of cards 
with that sum.
•  Play battle with the cards. Each child has half a deck, and 
they turn over the cards simultaneously. High count wins 
both cards. An alternative is to turn over two cards and 
the highest sum takes all the cards. Ask students to sug-
gest what should be done if the two cards have the same 
sum.

such as the D’Nealian number forms shown in Fig-
ure 9.12. You will probably need to practice the ad-
opted handwriting systems so that you are a good 
model for children.
Writing opens up many new opportunities for 
children to make their own books and displays. On a 
page, “one” and “1” are written, and the child draws 
or pastes examples of one object. On the “two” page, 
two objects are drawn or pasted. Posting children’s 
work or making books for the class library extends 
interest as children go back to these products again. 
Booklets are also good home projects, from simple 
counting projects to special number topics such 
as odd and even numbers, multiples, and number 
patterns.
Misconceptions and Problems 
with Counting and Numbers
Despite well-planned developmental activities, some 
children experience problems with number. Some 
children have developmental delays or other special 
needs that interfere with language, motor control, or 
cognitive development. Children with limited vision 
or certain physical disabilities may need larger ma-
terials that are easier to see and handle. In analyzing 
children’s counting behaviors, Gelman and Gallistel 
(1978, pp. 106– 108) observed and identiﬁ ed a num-
ber of common errors:
•  A child may make a coordination error 
when the count is not started until after the 
ﬁ rst item has been touched, which results 
in an undercount, or when the count 
continues after the ﬁ nal item has been 
touched, which results in an overcount.
•  A child may make omission errors when 
one or more items are skipped.
•  A child may make a double-count error 
by counting one or more items more than 
once.
•  A child may use idiosyncratic counting 
sequences such as “1, 2, 4, 6, 10.”
If children have difﬁ culty with counting and 
make coordination, omission, or double-counting 
errors, they can count objects on a paper or a mag-
netic board with a line marked down the center. As 
children count each object, they move it from the 
left half to the right half. This action reduces the op-
portunity to begin or end the count improperly, to 
skip one or more objects, or to double-count some. 
After counting proﬁ ciency is achieved, a child may 
not need to move the objects.
Reversal errors in writing numerals, as with 6 
and 9 or 5 and 2, are common among children. Eye-
hand and ﬁ ne muscle coordination are needed be-
fore children can write with accuracy and comfort. 
If children count accurately, written reversals should 
not cause concern. If the problem persists into the 
second or third grade, the teacher may refer the 
student for visual or motor coordination problems. 
Adapting material for students with visual or motor 
impairments might include providing larger materi-
als or using materials with rough surfaces.
Introducing Ordinal Numbers
Ordinal numbers describe relative position in a se-
quence or line. Ordinal numbers occur in many situ-
ations that students and teachers can discuss and 
label. Children can stand at the ﬁ rst, sixth, or tenth 
place from zero on the number line. When children 
line up for recess or dismissal, they notice who is 
ﬁ rst, last, second, ﬁ fth, or middle. The bases in base-
ball are also ﬁ rst, second, third, and home (or last) 
base. Discussing sequence in stories, in days of the 
week or month, or in each day’s events uses ordinal 
numbers. Asking questions calls attention to ordinal 
concepts:
•  Who was the third animal that Chicken Little 
talked to?
•  Who is second in line today?
•  What happens during the second week of this 
month?

Chapter 9 Developing Concepts of Number

When children see the ordinal usage occur in com-
mon classroom situations and hear adults use the 
various terms correctly, most have little trouble with 
this use of numbers.
Other Number Skills
From their ﬁ rst encounters with numbers and count-
ing, students learn some important number skills 
that extend their understanding of how numbers 
work. Skip counting and concepts of odd and even 
are introduced in primary grades.
Skip Counting
First experiences in counting are based on one-
to-one correspondence between objects and the 
natural numbers 1, 2, 3. Skip counting is performed 
with objects that occur in groups of 2, 3, 4, 5, or oth-
ers. Skip counting encourages faster and ﬂ exible 
counting and is connected to multiplication and 
division.
•  How many eyes are in our room? Count by two.
•  How many chair legs are in the room? How can 
we count them quickly?
•  We have 15 dimes and 7 nickels. What is a quick 
way to count our money?
A hundreds board or chart is a visual way for chil-
dren to investigate skip counting (see Activ ity 9.15).
One-to-One and Other 
Correspondences
Children use one-to-one correspondence as the ba-
sis for relating one object to one counting number. 
They also need experience with other correspon-
dences and relations: one-to-many, many-to-one, 
and many-to-many. One-to-many correspondences 
and many-to-one correspondences are used every 
day in many reversible situations; some examples 
are shown in Table 9.1.
A good problem-solving strategy for many-to-
many correspondences is a rate table. If three pen-
cils cost 25 cents, how many pencils will 75 cents 
buy? The ratio between pencils and cents is 3:25 
which is extended as far as it is needed to answer 
the question.

•  Ask students to color numbers as they skip-count by twos 
on the chart. Ask students to describe the design made by 
multiples of 2.
•  Have students in each group color the hundreds chart 
for multiples of 3, 4, 5, and so on, and watch for designs 
made by the patterns. After students have completed indi-
vidual number pages, make a book in which they describe 
the patterns found.
•  Pose questions such as, “What skip-counting pattern 
begins at the top left and moves downward toward the 
bottom right corner?” “Name a skip-counting pattern that 
begins at the top right and moves diagonally downward 
to the left.”

•  Beginning at 2, every other number is an even 
number; beginning at 1, every other number is 
odd.
•  The column on the left side of the chart contains 
all odd numbers ending in 1. Each alternate col-
umn ends in 3, 5, 7, and 9.
•  The second column from the left contains all 
even numbers that end in 2.
•  Each alternate column across the chart contains 
even numbers ending in 4, 6, 8, and 0.
•  Even numbers are all multiples of 2.
Similar conclusions can be made about 3, 4, 5, 
and other numbers as students explore patterns. 
Intermediate-grade students can study even and 
odd numbers at a more abstract level. They should 
develop and justify these generalizations during 
their investigations.

Odd and Even Numbers
Counting by twos prompts children’s thinking about 
odd and even numbers. Counting eyes, or ears, or 
feet, or twins helps students recognize naturally oc-
curring situations of even numbers. Even num bers 
are a set of numbers divisible by 2 with no remain-
der. Odd numbers are the set of numbers not divis-
ible by 2 evenly and they cannot be organized into 
pairs. Skip counting by 2 is a way to identify even 
numbers. In Activity 9.16 children use plastic disks 
to determine which numbers are even and which 
are odd. Objects that can be arranged in pairs rep-
resent even numbers. Knowledge of even and odd 
numbers establishes a pattern that is also used for 
ﬁ nding other patterns and relationships.
The number line and hundreds chart are used 
for further investigations with even and odd num-
bers. Children make a variety of observations about 
the number chart:

Research for the Classroom
•
Various research ﬁ ndings have determined that young 
children learn to count and use numbers in purposeful 
ways at an early age. Caulﬁ eld (2000) suggests that the 
human brain is “born to count” as a natural way of orga-
nizing the physical world. Suggate and colleagues (1997) 
studied mathematical knowledge and strategies of 4- and 
5-year-olds over a year. Most students had a high level 
of numerical proﬁ ciency at the beginning of the year and 
improved over the year. However, a few students showed 
little improvement over the year. Wright (1994) also stud-
ied the growth of forty-one 5- and 6-year-olds for a year. 
However, his ﬁ ndings emphasize the mismatch between 
the children’s numerical competence and the demands of 
the curriculum.
 
Jones and colleagues (1992) reported that ﬁ rst-grade 
students engaged in a tutoring program became more 
ﬂ exible in their numerical strategies and were successful 
at tasks that were more complex than usually expected 
of them. The tutoring program involved working in pairs 
with a teacher on inquiry and exploratory mathematical 
tasks. The mentor-teachers also changed their practices 
and beliefs about what students could learn as a result of 
participation in the program.
 
In summary, young children have many numerical skills 
and can learn new strategies if teaching is interactive, rel-
evant, and encourages thinking about number rather than 
memorizing processes without understanding.
ACTIVITY 9.16
 
Even and Odd (Reasoning)
Level: Grades 1 and 2
Setting: Student pairs
Objective: Students recognize odd and even numbers by pairing 
objects.
Materials: Counting disks or other objects
•  Ask students to arrange eight disks in two rows. Ask if 
they can put the same number in each row.
(a)
•  Ask students to ﬁ nd other numbers of disks to make two 
equal rows. Put their numbers on a chart, or mark them 
on a hundreds chart.
•  Ask students to arrange seven disks in two rows. Ask if 
the two rows are equal.
(b)
•  Ask students to ﬁ nd other numbers that do not make two 
equal rows. Put these numbers on the board, or mark 
them with a different color on the hundreds chart.
•  Say: “Numbers that make two equal rows have a special 
name.” If students do not volunteer “even,” supply it.
•  Say: “Numbers that cannot make two equal rows also 
have a name.” If students do not know “odd,” supply it.
•  After every even number is an odd number, which can be 
expressed as 2n  1.
Students may be asked whether zero is an even num-
ber and to explain their thinking.
 
Chapter 9 Developing Concepts of Number 
157

Summary
Children use numbers in many ways: to label, to order, 
to count, and to solve problems in their lives. Young chil-
dren classify and sequence objects based on physical 
qualities. Through a variety of manipulative and lan-
guage experiences, children learn about number as an 
abstract property of sets that can be represented with 
objects, in pictures, and with symbols, called numerals. 
Interactions with numbers in books, songs, poems, puz-
zles, games, and objects contribute to the development of 
number and numerals. Rote counting, rational counting, 
and number conservation are important achievements 
in learning about numbers. In rote counting children can 
recite number words, whereas rational counting demon-
strates the relationship between number words and ob-
jects. Understanding that number is constant regardless 
of the arrangement of objects is called number conser-
vation or constancy and is a developmental milestone 
about age 6 for children.
When children encounter numbers in meaningful 
settings and situations, they begin to think about num-
bers in terms of number patterns, reasonableness, and 
estimation. Questions such as what number is after 99, 
what number is between 43 and 45, or which numbers 
are odd and even serve as the foundation for number 
sense with larger numbers, computation, and algebraic 
thinking. Recognizing patterns in numbers up to 100 sets 
the stage for understanding the Hindu-Arabic, or base-
10, numeration system. Hindu-Arabic numeration is a 
place-value system based on the number 10 that allows 
numbers of any size to be represented in an economical 
way. Developed over centuries, the Hindu-Arabic system 
provides efﬁ cient algorithms for computation.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Number sense is a major goal of instruction in num-
bers. How aware of numbers are you in everyday 
life? Do you notice how much groceries cost? how 
much you tip a server? how long you wait on line? 
how much you save on an item on sale?
 2.  Ask several young children, ages 4, 5, or 6, to count 
aloud for you to 20. Then ask them to count a set of 
12 pennies or other small objects. Record what each 
child does. Did you ﬁ nd any differences in their 
rote and rational counting abilities? Did any of them 
demonstrate the common counting errors listed by 
Gelman and Gallistel? What procedures would you 
recommend for helping a child overcome counting 
errors?
 3.  Read a counting book with a group of young chil-
dren. Observe their reactions to the pictures, numer-
als, and story. What did you learn about children’s 
understanding of numbers and number concepts?

Extending 
Number 
Concepts and 
Number Systems
s children master basic number concepts and can count 
and write numbers through 20, understanding larger 
numbers using the base-10 place-value system be-
comes the focus of instruction. Representing larger 
numbers with the Hindu-Arabic numeration system is a 
foundation for computation and number sense. Reasonable-
ness and estimation are essential for development of number sense—the 
ability to think with and about numbers. In this chapter activities develop 
understanding of place value and emphasize numbers sense.

NCTM Standards and 
Expectations
Understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, rela-
tionships among numbers, and number systems.
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  Count with understanding and recognize “how many” in 
sets of objects;
•  Use multiple models to develop initial understandings of 
place value and the base-10 number system;
•  Develop understanding of the relative position and mag-
nitude of whole numbers and of ordinal and cardinal 
numbers and their connections;
•  Develop a sense of whole numbers and represent and use 
them in ﬂ exible ways, including relating, composing, and 
decomposing numbers;
•  Connect number words and numerals to the quanti-
ties they represent, using various physical models and 
representations.
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  Understand the place-value structure of the base-10 
number system and be able to represent and compare 
whole numbers and decimals;
•  Recognize equivalent representations for the same num-
ber and generate them by decomposing and composing 
numbers;
•  Explore numbers less than 0 by extending the number line 
and through familiar applications.
Number Sense Every Day
Number sense should be an everyday event in class-
rooms. Teachers stimulate children’s thinking with 
and about numbers by posing questions based on 
daily occurrences.
•  Last week, the estimation jar held 300 cotton 
balls. This week it is full of golf balls. Do you think 
the jar holds more than 300 golf balls or fewer 
than 300 golf balls? Why do you think so?
•  Our class has 22 students, and 20 are eating in the 
cafeteria. If lunch costs 85 cents, will 20 lunches 
cost more or less than $20?
•  Sada put 200 color tiles in the bag. When groups 
each picked out ﬁ ve samples of 20, they reported 
these results:
 
Red 
Blue 
Yellow 
Green
Group 1 
43% 
24% 
17%

Group 2 
35% 
28% 
20% 
17%
Group 3 
39% 
25% 
21% 
15%
  What is your best estimate of the number of tiles 
of each color in the bag?
•  If everybody in our classroom had one pet, how 
many pets would we have? What if everybody had 
two pets? three pets? How could we ﬁ nd out how 
many pets we really have in our classroom?
•  The newspaper reports that the population of 
our state is growing by 30,000 each year. If 1 out 
of 3 individuals is of school age, how many new 
schools do we need to build each year?
Children with number sense see how numbers 
are represented and operated on in various ways, al-
lowing them to use number ﬂ exibly in computation 
and problem solving.
•  Half a gallon of ice cream is 1
2, 0.5, or 50% of a gal-
lon or 2 quarts or 4 pints or 8 cups.
•  If an $80 coat is reduced by 25% on sale, one-
fourth of $80 is $20. The coat costs $60 plus tax.
•  One meter is slightly longer than 1 yard; running 
a 100-meter race should take slightly longer than 
running a 100-yard race.
•  The product of 3.8 and 9.1 is approximately 4  9 
 36.
At the core of number sense is ﬂ exible under-
standing of numbers and how they can be repre-
sented in various ways. Rather than memorizing 
rules, students are asked to develop numbers as 
they solve problems, estimate, and draw reasonable 
conclusions from numerical information.
Teachers who engage children in mathematical 
conversation encourage children to think about 
numbers and their meaning. Ms. Chen wants to 
know whether her second-grade students recognize 
different representations for 27 using a hundreds 
chart and base-10 materials.
Amani: Twenty-seven comes after 26 and before 28.
Guillermo: Twenty-seven is three more than 24 
and three smaller than 30.
Lisette: Twenty-seven is two groups of ten and 
seven ones.
Yolanda: Twenty-seven is 10 more than 17 and 10 
less than 37 on the hundreds chart.
Ian: I can count to 27 by threes: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 
24, 27, but counting by fours is 28.
Jermaine: Twenty-seven is an odd number be-
cause you skip it when you count by twos.
When making 27 with base-10 materials, some dis-
play 27 with two orange rods and seven white cubes; 

 
Chapter 10 Extending Number Concepts and Number Systems 
163
others line up 27 loose cubes, 2 bean sticks and 7 
beans, or 9 groups of 3 (Figure 10.1).
By observing and listening to children, the 
teacher learns whether they understand many nu-
meral expressions for 27. From student comments 
and demonstrations, Ms. Chen believes that students 
have developed a ﬂ exible understanding of number 
and its many representations, so she is ready to in-
troduce the place-value system in a more compre-
hensive way. Extending their understanding of num-
ber and place value to hundreds and thousands is 
critical for understanding number operations with 
larger numbers.
Understanding the Base-10 
Numeration System
When students are learning to count, they often think 
of each number as having its own unique name. 
Numbers 0– 9 do have unique names, but learn-
ing a different name for all the numbers from 10 to 
999,999 would be impractical and impossible to re-
member. Instead the place-value system allows the 
same 10 symbols to have different values depending 
on the position in a numeral: 6 could have a value 
of 6 in the ones position, 60 in the tens position, or 
600 in the hundreds position. The hundreds chart 
(Figure 10.2) illustrates for children the pattern of 
tens and ones that structures the base-10 numera-
tion system.
Counting by tens and the hundreds chart intro-
duce the pattern of tens in the number system. Base-
10 materials represent numbers concretely. Com-
mercial and teacher-made materials (bean sticks, 
bundles of stir sticks, graph paper, or strings of 
beads) are useful for rep-
resenting values to 1,000 
(see Photo 10.1).
Place-value 
materi-
als can be either propor-
tional or nonproportional. 
Proportional materials
show value with the size 
of the materials. When the 
manipulative piece repre-
senting one unit is deter-
mined, the tens piece is 
10 times larger, and the 
hundreds piece is 10 times 
the tens place. Some ma-
terials allow students to 
create their own base-10 
materials. A tower of 10 
Uniﬁ x cubes represents 
10. If one tongue depres-
sor or popsicle stick is the unit, a bundle of 10 repre-
sents tens, and 10 bundles are 100. A paper clip is 1, 
a chain of 10 paper clips would be the tens, and ten 
chains hooked together show 100. Base-10 blocks, 
Cuisenaire rods, and bean sticks are proportional 
materials with the tens unit already joined together.
Nonproportional materials can also represent 
place values, although the one-to-ten relationship is 
not shown in the size of materials. Money is the most 
familiar nonproportional material. Dimes are not 10 
times as large as pennies, and dollar coins or bills 
are not 10 times as large as dimes. Nonproportional-
ity makes money exchange confusing for younger

MISCONCEPTION
English counting words 
above ten (eleven, twelve, 
thirteen through nineteen) 
hide the place-value 
meaning. Eleven means 
10  1, twelve is 10  2, 
and thirteen is 10  3. 
Connecting the values 
from 11 to 19 to their 
place-value meaning is 
important. Some teachers 
have the students use 
“count ten, ten plus one, 
ten plus two,” and so on 
as an alternative counting 
language up to 19. Above 
20 the place-value system 
and counting language 
correspond: 21 means 2 
tens plus 1.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
children. They have to remember the relationship 
rather than seeing the relationship. Chip trading 
materials and an abacus are also nonproportional 
materials. Value of a number is indicated by color 
and position rather than by size. The Hindu-Arabic 
numeration system is also nonproportional because 
numerals are evaluated by their position.
Both proportional materials and nonpropor-
tional materials are useful, but proportional materi-
als emphasize the relative value of the places and

Trains and Cars (Representation)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Pairs
Objective: Students recognize 10 as an organizer for counting 
numbers larger than 10.
Materials: Uniﬁ x cubes
•  Give pairs of children a bowl of Uniﬁ x cubes. Have each 
student count 10 single cubes and put them together to 
make a train.
•  Ask them how many trains they can make with the cubes 
in their bowl. Ask how many trains and how many extra 
cars.
•  Let the students tell what they have in their bowl. Have 
each pair compare the number of cubes in their trains 
with those in other trains.
•  Ask two groups to combine their trains and extra cars to 
see how many trains they have together.
•  Count trains by tens, and ask students if any group has 
10 trains. Emphasize that 10 trains is 1 hundred.

are recommended for initial instruction in the base-
10 system. Children enjoy making a set of base-10 
materials by bundling stirring sticks to show groups 
of 10, then bundling 10 groups of 10 into a big bundle 
of 100. Working with a variety of materials shows 
children that place value is a characteristic of the 
number system rather than a particular manipula-
tive. Activity 10.1 introduces place value with Uni-
ﬁ x cubes and trains of 10. Activity 10.2 introduces 
a train-car work mat with a tens column and a ones 
column. Additional task cards guide children during 
independent learning activities.
Place-value materials and activities continue 
through grade 6 as students represent larger num-
bers and model problems in addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. Children show their un-
derstanding of place value with materials, actions, 
simple diagrams (e.g., Figure 10.3), and numerals. 
Exchanging 10 ones for 1 ten and 10 tens for 1 hun-
dred establishes the place-value pattern for thou-
sands, millions, and billions. Children notice that 
the 9 is a precursor for the next larger place. The cal-
culator is a learning tool for place value as students 
repeatedly add 1 and note changes each time 9 is 
reached, such as 99  1 becomes 100. Introduction 
of the exchange from 99 to 100 is often celebrated 
on the hundredth day of school to call attention to 
the importance of 100. Students bring displays of 
100 beans, 100 cotton balls, and 100 peanuts.
and activities illustrate exchanges with any place-
value manipulatives. Activity 10.3 is an important in-
formal introduction to creating numbers up to 100 or 
1,000 by accumulating and trading up with propor-
tional materials of beans and sticks. Trading down 
begins with the 10 tens sticks, and children remove 
beans and sticks as they roll the die. This activity 
also serves as an informal assessment of children’s 
understanding of place value. Nonproportional ma-
terials, such as poker chips or color tiles, can be 
used to play the same game. Beans spray-painted 
yellow, blue, green, and red are inexpensive substi-
tutes for commercial materials. Game mats can be 
made of ﬁ le folders or tagboard.
Through teacher questioning with physical mod-
eling of place value, students begin to understand 
how place value works and should become comfort-
able with physical representations of larger values. 
As they progress, students discuss how many hun-
dreds, tens, and ones are in each number they cre-
ate. Symbolic representation also begins. Activity 
10.4 uses children’s names as the source for count-
ing ones, tens, and hundreds. In Activity 10.5 players 
have seven turns to accumulate 100 points without 
going over. The game can be played with place-
value materials on a game mat or with symbols as 
students are learning addition with regrouping.
Assessing Place-Value Understanding
Some students experience difﬁculty in understand-
ing place value. By working at the concrete level and 
not rushing the transition to symbolic representa-
tion, most students construct place-value meaning 
by the third grade. However, some students have 
continuing difﬁ culty with the meaning of tens and 
ones. Kamii (1986) developed a structured interview 
for place value. The interview can be done with any 
number using the steps shown in Activity 10.6.
 
Chapter 10 Extending Number Concepts and Number Systems

blocks showing 237
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
English counting language may also contribute to children’s 
confusion about tens and ones. In Asian and Latin-based 
languages, counting language emphasizes the place-value 
structure (Table 10.1). In Spanish, for example, 16 is diez y 
seis, or “10 and 6.” Students from various cultures might be 
invited to teach counting words in their language. With a 
chart such as Table 10.1, students notice the patterns based 
on tens in languages such as Chinese.
Exchanging, Trading, or Regrouping
When working with place-value materials, children 
trade, or exchange, ones for tens and tens for hun-
dreds, or the reverse. Exchanges between place 
values is most accurately called regrouping and 
renaming, but trading up and trading down are 
common terms. Both are more accurate terminol-
ogy than “carrying” or “borrowing” because they ac-
curately describe the physical actions. Many games

extra cars in the right column. Ask students to report how 
many items they have as “___ trains and ___ cars.”
•  As students understand the format, work up to sets 
between 30 and 100.
•  Provide index cards with numerals on 
them so that students can label the 
columns: 2 tens or 20 with index cards 
in one color, and 11, 12, 13 in another 
color.

Working with Larger Numbers
Large numbers are encountered as children think 
about stars in the sky, pennies in a piggy bank, 
or a large bag of popcorn kernels. Interest in big 
numbers and their names helps students explore 
the meaning and representation of numbers larger 
than 1,000. Numbers greater than 1,000 are seldom 
counted physically in real life. Although people 
could count to 10,000 or 1,000,000, they seldom actu-
ally physically count that many objects. Instead they 
represent large number values symbolically. Even if 
counting a large number is necessary, people usu-
ally create many smaller amounts and aggregate the 
total. A bank teller creates rolls of pennies, nickels, 
dimes, and quarters and bundles of bills before 
coming up with a total. Population of a city, for ex-
ample, is done by counting how many people live 
in speciﬁ c blocks or areas and adding for a grand 
total. Computer-based inventory systems keep track 
of large inventories in supermarkets and retail stores 
after inventories are taken by counting the number 
of items on the shelves of each store.
Manipulative work with numbers 1 through 1,000 
sets the stage for understanding how the base-10 
number system works. Thousands, millions, or bil-
lions follow the place-value pattern established with 
ones, tens, and hundreds and extends students’ 
understanding that number is abstract and inﬁ nite 
and that the place-value system represents inﬁ nitely 
large numbers in a compact form. Two books by

Beans and Sticks (Representation)
Level: Grades 2– 5
Setting: Small groups of 3 or 4 students
Objective: Students represent numbers in the place-value system.
Materials: Beans, bean sticks of 10, and bean ﬂ ats of 100 (or other 
base-10 materials); two-, three-, or four-column mat; number 
spinner or number cubes
•  Play a game with beans, sticks, the place-value mat, and a 
spinner or number cubes. Each player spins or rolls, counts 
that many beans, and puts them in the ones column. Play-
ers should take turns spinning or rolling.
•  As each player accumulates 10 loose beans, he or she 
trades 10 beans for a bean stick and puts it on the mat 
in the tens place. Play continues until all players have ten 
bean sticks and can trade for a bean ﬂ at.

•  The game continues into hundreds using a three-column 
mat, or to thousands with a four-column mat.
•  Give each group two spinners or two dice, and ask them 
to decide how to use two numbers on each turn.
•  Assess student knowledge and skill with a checklist 
identifying skills: count to 10; exchange accurately, call the 
correct number; write the numeral; explain tens and ones 
in number.
Variation
Play the same game with nonproportional materials, such 
as yellow, blue, green, and red chips or poker chips. Label 
the game mat with colors, starting with yellow at the 
right, then blue, green, and red on the left. Each group 
needs 5 red chips and 40 each of green, blue, and yellow 
chips, one game mat for each player, and one die.
•  After students have had ample time to play the game, ask 
them what they noticed about playing the game. Empha-
size the trading rule and the number of chips that can be 
in each color space.
•  Students can experiment with other trading rules, such 
as “trade 4” or “trade 9.” Younger children can also play 
the game with a trading rule such as “trade 4” to practice 
counting to 4.
•  Players start with a red chip and trade down until one 
player has cleared her or his mat.

E-vowel-uation (Representation)
Level: Grades 2– 5
Setting: Small groups or whole group
Objective: Students recognize that the position of the numeral 
determines its value.
Materials: Index cards
•  Ask students to write their first name (or first and last 
names) in block letters on one side of an index card. 
Announce that vowels are worth 1 cent each and that 
consonants are worth 10 cents each. Have them count or 
add up the value of their names.
KARA THOMPSON KRTHMPSN  80 cents AAOO  4 cents  84 cents
JUAN RODRIGUEZ 
JNRDRGZ  
70 cents UAOIUE  6 cents  76 cents
•  Ask students to line up from the lowest total to the high-
est total. Look at names that have low totals and high 
totals. Ask students to suggest reasons for the low and 
high totals.
•  Change the rule. Consonants are worth 1 cent each, and 
vowels are worth 10 cents each. Ask students if they think 
the total of their name will be larger or smaller. Let them 
calculate the new totals.
•  Ask what they notice about the values of their names 
with a new rule. Some children will have the same value 
under both rules. Some will notice that their name value 
switched from 35 cents to 53 cents. Ask why their names 
had the same or a different value.
•  Line up again using the new evaluation to see if the lineup 
is the same or different.
Variations
•  Put the cards on a bulletin board or in a card box, and 
order them from high to low or from low to high.
•  Using the two rules, look for names or words worth 
$1.00.
•  Using the two rules, look for names with large totals and 
small totals.
•  Have capital letters worth a bonus of $1 each. Most stu-
dents will have a $2 bonus, but some may have $3 or $4.
•  Use a different system for evaluating letters, such as place 
in the alphabet (A  1, B  2, etc.) or Scrabble scoring for 
letters.

Seven Chances for 100 (Reasoning)
Level: Grades 2– 5
Setting: Small groups or pairs
Objective: Students apply place value in a game and develop a 
strategy.
Materials: Die, base-10 blocks, two- or three-column place-
value mat
•  Organize groups of two to four children. Players take turns 
rolling the die. On each roll, students can decide whether 
the number will go with the tens or the ones: a 5 on the 
die can be worth either 50 (5 rods) or 5 (5 cubes). Each 
player will have exactly seven turns to get as close to 100 
points without going over. During play, students trade 10 
units for a tens rod. Remind students that they have to 
take all seven turns.
•  After playing for several days, ask students if they have 
developed a strategy for getting close to 100 without 
going over.
•  After playing the game with the base-10 materials, some 
students can write the scores on a tens and ones chart

Place-Value Assessment
Level: Grades 1– 4
Setting: Individuals
Objective: Students demonstrate an understanding of place value.
Materials: Cubes, paper and pencil
Based on the interview by Kamii (1986), ask students to 
identify the value of a two-digit numeral as well as the 
value of each numeral. The interview proceeds in ﬁ ve 
steps:
1.  Give a student 12 to 19 cubes, and then ask the 
student to count out 16 cubes and draw a picture of 
them on paper.
2.  Ask the student to write the numeral (e.g., 16) for the 
number of cubes.
3.  Ask the student to circle the number of drawn cubes 
shown by the numeral 16.
4.  Point to the 6 in the numeral 16, and ask the student 
to circle the number of cubes that goes with that 
numeral.
5.  Point to the 1 in the numeral 16, and ask the student 
to circle the number of cubes that goes with that 
numeral.
Evaluate the students’ understanding of the number.
 
The ﬁ gure illustrates responses to the interview. Many 
students circle the 16 cubes for “16” and 6 cubes for the 
“6” correctly, but for the “1” they circle only one block 
instead of ten. Based on her interviews, Kamii concluded 
that misconceptions about place value persist into third 
or fourth grade. Whether this problem is due to matura-
tion or inappropriate instruction is not clear, but teach-
ers should be sensitive to students and provide more 
developmental activities as needed. Concrete models for 
trading are essential to illustrate the dynamic nature of 
place value.

ACTIVITY 10.7
 
Think of a Million (Reasoning and Representation)
Level: Grades 3– 6
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students visualize the magnitude of large numbers.
Materials: How Much Is a Million? by David Schwartz, illustrated 
by Steven Kellogg (New York: Lothrop, Lee & Shepard, 1985); 
package of popcorn kernels or dried beans
•  Show students a package of popcorn kernels or dried 
beans. Ask if they think there could be a million kernels 
in the package. Have students count the number in one 
package.
•  Based on the number, ask students how many packages 
they would need to get to a million. Use multiplication by 
10 and 100 as a quick way to determine the number of 
packages. A rate table is useful for this.

•  Introduce Schwartz’s book, and read through it, stopping 
to discuss the illustrations and questions posed in the text.
•  Ask students to suggest other things that could be a 
million. Cooperative groups select a topic and determine 
how to make a million. Students may wish to refer to 
Schwartz’s calculations in the back of the book.
Extension
Another book by David Schwartz, also illustrated by Ste-
ven Kellogg, is If You Made a Million (New York: Lothrop, 
Lee & Shepard, 1989). This book engages children in 
thinking about money and the responsibilities that come 
with large amounts of it.

Spin to Win (Representation and Reasoning)
Level: Grades 3– 6
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students demonstrate place-value knowledge and 
develop a strategy.
Materials: Spinner, numeral cards (0– 9), standard die or a die with 
numerals 0– 10 for each group
•  On the overhead projector, show a transparency with four 
boxes labeled thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones. Have 
students make a similar board on their paper.
Thousands
Tens
Hundreds
Ones
•  Announce the goal of the game, such as making the larg-
est four-digit number.
•  Using a spinner, number cards, or a die to randomly 
generate numbers, call out one number at a time. After 
each number is called, write it in one of the four place-
value boxes on the overhead. Once a number is placed, it 
cannot be moved.
•  Spin, roll, or draw cards, and have students ﬁ ll in their 
forms. After four numbers have been picked, ask students 
to tell the largest number anyone made. Ask for the larg-
est number possible.
•  In cooperative groups, have students take turns at the 
spinner while other students ﬁ ll in the place-value chart.
•  Vary the game goals: Make the smallest numeral with the 
four numbers called out. Make a number that is closest to 
7,000. Make a number between 4,000 and 6,000.
•  The number of places can be reduced to three for younger 
students and increased for older students.
Variation
After students are proﬁ cient with the game, the game 
goal and board can be changed to include addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division. Create a game 
board with three blanks on the top line and two on the 
bottom line. Place numbers in the blanks to make the 
largest sum, the smallest sum, the largest difference, 
the smallest difference, the largest product, the smallest 
product, or the smallest dividend. Students can create 
their own boards and game goals.

David Schwartz, How Much Is a Million? (1985) and 
If You Made a Million (1989), invite children to imag-
ine the magnitude of large numbers. In Activity 10.7, 
How Much Is a Million? stimulates investigation into 
ways of representing large numbers.
In Activity 10.8 children create the largest or 
smallest possible numeral with four rolls of a die or 
spinner. As they play, students develop strategies to 
maximize the number and develop an understand-
ing of chance. Populations of cities provide mean-
ing for large numbers in Activity 10.9. Students com-
pare, order, and combine the populations of cities 
and also discuss meanings related to the location 
and other characteristics of large cities.
Real-world settings provide context for large 
numbers. When children understand how the place-
value system represents large numbers, they begin 
to comprehend such things as the size of the popu-
lation of the United States relative to that of other 
countries (Table 10.2).
Newspapers and almanacs are also resources 
for a “big number” search. When students ﬁ nd 
big numbers, they write them on index cards with 
what they represent and put them on a classroom

ACTIVITY 10.9
 
Big City (Reasoning and Connections)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students ﬁ nd data with large numbers to use for iden-
tifying place value, comparing numbers, ordering, rounding, and 
estimating.
Materials: Table of data on populations
•  Ask students to list large cities in North America. They 
may want to think of professional sports teams.
•  Explain that large cities are often part of a metropolitan 
area that includes a central city or cities plus the suburbs 
and surrounding smaller towns.
•  Display a table showing the populations of the 15 larg-
est metropolitan areas, and have students organize the 
data. These data may be found in an almanac or on the 
Internet.
•  In cooperative groups, have students create three to ﬁ ve 
questions to be answered with the data display.
•  Which cities have populations of more than 5 million?
•  Which cities have more population than Dallas and 
Houston put together?
•  Which cities are 4,000,000 larger than another city?
•  Round the populations of all the cities to the nearest 
million.
•  Which cities have half the population of Chicago?
Extensions
•  Find population data for the 10 largest cities and towns 
in your state. Put the cities and their populations on index 
cards for grouping and ordering.
•  Locate the 15 largest U.S. metropolitan areas on a map 
of the United States. Are there any patterns to where the 
cities are located?
•  Compare populations in 2000 to populations in 1950. 
What cities have been added, and which have lost rank-
ings? What factors might contribute to the changes?

chart (Figure 10.4). The cards can be classiﬁ ed, com-
pared, and sequenced. Big numbers with meaning 
motivate children to learn names for large numbers: 
millions, billions, trillions, and so forth.
States is to separate each period of three numerals 
with commas. Internationally, spaces are often used 
instead of commas to separate the period group-
ings, as shown here:

Do you prefer using spaces or commas for separat-
ing the periods in large numbers? What are the 
advantages and disadvantages of each notation 
system? •••
After establishing the meaning of numbers with 
base-10 materials, students are ready to record 
numbers in various ways, including compact and 
expanded numeral forms. The compact form for nu-
merals such as 53,489 is most common, but it can be 
represented in several ways:
With words: Fifty-three thousand four hundred 
eighty-nine
With numerals and words: 5 ten thousands, 3 thou-
sands, 4 hundreds, 8 tens, 9 ones; or 53 thousands, 
4 hundreds, 8 tens, 9 ones
With numerals: 50,000  3,000  400  80  9
With expanded notation: (5  10,000)  (3  1,000) 
 (4  100)  (8  10)  9
With exponents: 5  104  3  103  4  102  8  
101  9  100
Exponential notation for large and small numbers 
is written with powers of 10 or exponents: 20,000 
becomes 2  10,000 or 2  104. Intermediate- and 
middle-grade students learn scientiﬁ c or exponen-
tial notation for larger numbers, such as distances 
in space.
Thinking with Numbers
While learning about the Hindu-Arabic numeration 
system, students also become aware of how impor-
tant numbers are in daily living. Numbers also pro-
vide useful information for the classroom. Becom-
ing aware of the role of numbers is a ﬁ rst step in 
number sense.

A place-value chart to millions or billions high-
lights the structure, pattern, and nomenclature of 
the numeration system. Each grouping of three 
numbers is called a period; the three numbers in 
the period are hundreds, tens, and ones. Students 
should be familiar with the smallest period and 
how to read numbers having three numerals, for 
example, 379 as three hundred seventy-nine. If the 
number were 379,379, the second period would be 
called three hundred seventy-nine thousand. The

•  How much does a gallon of milk cost?
•  How far is the grocery store, and how long does it 
take to walk? to drive? to take the subway?
•  How long will it take to do my homework? Do I 
have time before supper to ﬁ nish?
•  If I need 12 pages of paper for my booklet, how 
many pages does everyone in the class need for 
their projects?
The answers to many questions are estimations and 
approximations.
•  Milk is about $3 a gallon.
•  The grocery store is about 5 miles away. It takes 
10 minutes by car, 75 minutes walking, and 
20 minutes by subway.
•  I can ﬁ nish this homework in 25 minutes and 
still have 15 minutes to play basketball before 
dinner.
•  We are going to need about 250 pages of paper 
for 20 projects.
People learn from experience to make educated 
guesses. Working with large numbers is a good time 
to emphasize number sense, the ability to think 
about numbers in meaningful and reasonable ways. 
Exact answers are not always required. If the airport 
reported 1,212,678 outgoing passengers this year, is 
that number absolutely accurate? Is it possible that 
somebody did not get counted? Does 1 person or 
even 10 or 1,000 people make that much difference 
in a number the size of 1 million?
Rounding and estimating are important nu-
merical thinking skills. Rounding expresses vital 
information about a number without being unnec-
essarily detailed. The number of passengers in the 
airport could be expressed as “more than 1 million,” 
“1.2 million,” or “nearly one and a quarter million.” 
Rounding emphasizes the important information 
without the less important details. Different people 
might need more or less precision in a number. The 
airport manager and board may need the detailed 
information, but the citizens only need to know “a 
little more than 1 million.”
Estimation is a reasonable guess, hypothesis, 
or conjecture based on numerical information. It 
is more than rounding, although rounding is often 
used in estimation. If somebody wanted to know the 
average number of passengers that traveled each day 
of the year, they could divide 1,212,678 by 365 days 
and get a computed answer that 3,322.4054 people 
traveled each day. However, the computed an-
swer is not a meaningful answer for several 
reasons, especially the 0.4054 person. Reasonably 
rounded numbers allow ease of computation or 
even mental computation.
•  Think: 1,200,000 divided by 300 is 4,000.
•  Think: 1,200,000 divided by 400 is 3,000.
A reasonable estimate would be between 3,000 and 
4,000—maybe 3,500 passengers on average. An es-
timate communicates numerical information with 
meaning. Students might also note that the number 
of passengers is larger than average on the busi-
est travel days of the year and less than average on 
other days.
E X E RC I S E
What times of the year do most airports have the 
largest and smallest passenger counts? Which days 
might be busiest for airports in Orlando? Puerto 
Rico? Denver? •••
Students learn to think about rounding and es-
timation in the context of working with larger num-
bers. Teachers report that students resist estimation. 
Students who have been taught about numbers with 
an emphasis on accuracy and getting the right an-
swer may not be comfortable with “close enough” as 
an answer. Children may also resist textbook exer-
cises in rounding and estimation because the num-
bers are small enough that they can be calculated 
and understood without rounding or estimation. 
Should students estimate the sum of 34  47 when 
they can easily calculate it? Rounding down to 30 
E

174 
Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
and up to 50 for an estimated answer of 80 is more 
trouble and work than adding the two numbers and 
getting the accurate answer 81. Numbers less than 
1,000 may be used to introduce the processes, but 
rounding and estimation should move quickly to 
examples that illustrate their utility with larger num-
bers and their meaning.
Rounding
Thoughts about rounding begin when children com-
pare numbers and see them on a number line or 
hundreds chart. Using a number line, students visu-
alize the order and relative position of numbers and 
discuss how numbers relate to each other.
•  What number comes after 38? 49? 87?
•  What numbers are found between 38 and 52? Is 
43 closer to 38 or to 52? Is 49 closer to 38 or to 52?
•  What is the hundred after 365? What is the hun-
dred before 365?
•  What is a number between 300 and 400? Is it 
closer to 300 or 400?
•  Is 385 closer to 300 or to 400? Is 307 closer to 300 
or to 400?
Rounding is introduced with numbers between 0 
and 100. When looking at 67 on a number line (Fig-
ure 10.5a), children can see that 67 is between 60 
and 70 but only three steps from 70. They recognize 
that 67 is nearer to 70 than to 60. On the other hand, 
62 is closer to 60 than to 70 (Figure 10.5b). Because 
65 is ﬁ ve steps from 60 and ﬁ ve steps from 70, they 
learn that midway numbers are usually rounded up-
ward, so 65 is rounded to 70 and 650 is rounded to 
700. Some teachers have students draw the number 
line between 60 and 70 as a hump with 65 at the top 
(Figure 10.5c). This visual clue shows that numbers 
below 5 slide back and numbers above the midway 
point slide forward.
When rounding to the hundreds, students ﬁ nd 
the numeral in the hundreds place, think next larg-
est hundred, and determine whether the tens and 
ones are more or less than 50. They can draw a 
number line segment, such as Figure 10.5d, to see 
whether 383 is closer to 300 or to 400. Likewise, 834 
is rounded to 800 because it is closer to 800 than to 
900 (Figure 10.5e). Because 650 is midway between 
600 and 700, the convention is to round it upward 
to 700. After learning the process of rounding to the 
nearest ten and hundred, students can use the same 
process to round to any place value depending on 
the precision wanted. When rounding is taught as a 
thinking process rather than as a mechanical one, 
students ask themselves whether 74,587 is closer to 
74,000 or to 75,000.
•  The population of our county is 74,587. Round 
to the nearest thousand and to the nearest ten 
thousand.
•  Round the population of the United States in 2006 
to the nearest million.
Some students may talk through the process or cir-
cle numbers as a reminder. Having verbal and visual 
cues helps students think about the number and 
process of rounding as they become more skilled. 
Once children understand rounding numbers, prob-
lem-solving activities provide practice and applica-
tion of the process. The task card shown in Figure 
10.6 provides practice with rounding numbers from 
real situations.

What are your answers to the task card in Figure 
10.6? What process did you use to round the num-
bers? Was your process more a step-by-step pro-
cess that you learned or more thinking about the 
situation? •••
Estimation
When people do not have speciﬁ c information or 
need a precise answer, they often make an edu-
cated guess.
•  How much time should I plan for commuting this 
morning?
•  How much money do I need for a vacation at the 
beach?
•  Would a couch or two loveseats ﬁ t best in the 
room?
•  How much have I spent on groceries today?
An estimate is an educated or reasonable guess 
based on information, prior knowledge, and judg-
ment. Even when information is known, the situation 
may call for estimation. The carpenter measures the 
room for ﬂ ooring as 10 feet by 121
2 feet, calculates 
the area, then increases the estimate by 10% to ac-
count for waste, matching pattern, or irregularities 
in product. A chef decides how much meat, pasta, 
vegetable, and bread must be stocked by estimating 
the number of customers who are likely to order dif-
ferent meals.
Estimation of quantity improves when a bench-
mark, or referent, is used. A benchmark gives stu-
dents a comparison unit or amount to use for an es-
E
timate. Without a benchmark, students have a hard 
time making a reasonable estimate and reﬁ ning 
it. Students then resort to wild guessing instead of 
thoughtful estimation. Activities with an estimation 
jar help students develop their idea of number. As 
students ﬁ ll jars with different objects, they can use 
benchmarks to explain their estimates.
•  “If the baby food jar holds 943 popcorn ker nels, 
the jelly jar should hold about 3,000 because it is 
about three times as big.”
•  “The mayonnaise jar holds 4,000 popcorn ker -
nels. It might hold 100 cotton balls because the 
cotton balls are much bigger than popcorn. But 
cotton balls will squeeze up so it might hold more 
than 100.”
•  “The jar holds 126 jelly beans, but I think the num-
ber of marshmallows will be fewer than 126 be-
cause they are bigger; maybe 50 marshmallows?”
•  “The little jar is less than half as big as the liter jar; 
maybe it holds 400 milliliters to 500 milliliters.”
The goal is to ﬁ nd an acceptable range of estimates 
and to recognize whether an estimate is out of that 
reasonable range. Through activities such as Activ-
ity 10.10 with an estimation jar, students learn the 
difference between wild guesses and reasonable 
estimates. The difﬁ culty of the estimate depends on 
the size of the jar and the size of the objects. It can 
be adapted for kindergarten so that the number of 
objects is 20 to 30 or into hundreds for older chil-
dren. Teachers should take care not to give prizes 
for the closest estimate but recognize all students as 
they make reasonable estimates.
Round each number to the nearest hundred, then to the nearest thousand:
• The baseball game was attended by 3291 fans.
•  The trip from London, England, to Sydney, Australia, stopped in New York. 
The total distance was 14,648 miles.
•  The telethon collected $113,689 for multiple sclerosis.
Think about each situation. Does it make more sense to round to the hundreds 
or to the thousands?
Figure 10.6 
Problem card used to practice 
rounding numbers

Problems related to 
other content and real life 
also involve estimation. 
Estimating packages of 
popcorn for a class party is 
based on past experiences 
of popping corn and how 
much popcorn each child 
will eat. Children’s prior 
knowledge and number 
awareness are essential 
to estimation and reason-
ableness. Students can 
also predict future events 
based on information.
•  A population graph for the United States shows an 
increase from 250,000,000 to 275,000,000 between 
1990 and 2000. What do you estimate it to be by 
the year 2008 if the growth rate stays the same? 
What if the growth rate increases; what popula-
tion would you estimate in 2010?
•  If the water in a jar evaporates 1 centimeter per 
day at a room temperature of 75 degrees and 
5 centimeters per day at 85 degrees, how much 
do you think will evaporate at a temperature of 
95 degrees?
•  If the car travels 408 miles on a tank of gas, how 
many tanks are needed for a 1,000-mile trip?
In addition to numerical situations, estimation 
applies to problems and situations in geometry, 
measurement, statistics, probability, and fractions. 
Activity 10.11 suggests how to develop estimations 
using information from previous events.
Addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and divi-
sion 
calculations 
with 
larger numbers are often 
estimated because exact 
answers are not needed. 
The following problems 
can be answered by com-
putation, by calculator, or 
by estimation. Rounding is 
useful in ﬁ nding numbers 
that are easier to estimate.
•  If the largest city in the state has a population 
of 2,218,899, and the second largest city has a 
MISCONCEPTION
Many students feel estima-
tion results in the “wrong” 
answer, especially if 
mathematics emphasized 
getting the right answer 
rather than number sense. 
Students need comfort 
and skill for thinking 
about “close enough.” 
Problems and projects 
that require approximate 
rather than exact answers 
help students develop 
skill and conﬁ dence.
ACTIVITY 10.10
 
How Many Beans? (Reasoning)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students estimate the number of beans in a glass jar.
Materials: Jar ﬁ lled with jelly beans (lima beans, etc.), smaller jar or 
cup, extra beans, ruler
•  Display the jar filled with beans. Ask for first estimates, 
which can be written on a chart. Tell students to use any 
strategy they wish—short of removing the beans from 
the estimation jar and counting them. When students 
estimate for the first time, they will be guessing.
•  Discuss the ﬁ rst estimates: high, low, middle, cluster of es-
timates, range (high to low). Students can also talk about 
how they determined their estimates.
•  Provide a benchmark for their estimate either in a smaller 
jar or the same size jar with a set number of jelly beans, 
such as 50.
•  Ask if students want to revise their esti-
mates based on the new information.
•  Post the revised estimates, and compare 
them.
•  Have students count the jelly beans in 
groups of 10 or 20. Post a ﬁ nal number. 
Compare second estimates to the

decide which estimates were reasonably close to the ac-
tual number. The goal of an estimation jar is to ﬁ nd all the 
estimates that were reasonable.

•  Organize cooperative groups and describe their task.
1.  Have students use the information from prior years 
to estimate how much food they should have for the 
2007 sale.
2.  Have students explain how they came up with each of 
their estimates.
3.  Ask the students to write down any question or issues 
that came up in their estimations that they believe 
would improve their estimate.
4.  Have each group compare its projections with those 
of other groups. Have the groups tell whether their 
estimates are similar to or different from other groups’ 
estimates.
•  Use newspapers or almanacs to ﬁ nd other data that show 
changes over time, such as population or crops. Develop 
some questions for another cooperative group to answer 
using the data and estimation.

Research for the Classroom
•
Recent research studies have investigated the computa-
tional strategies used by children as well as their under-
standing of the strategies they have been taught. The 
conclusion is that students can develop computational 
strategies, although not all students develop the same 
level of skill with strategies or from the same instruction.
 
Murphy (2004) interviewed three children to determine 
whether they were using compensation in two-digit addi-
tion problems.  She found that one used primarily counting 
on and two employed both counting on and the associa-
tive law to raise one number to a multiple of 10, then 
added the remainder. She instructed the three students 
on compensation (adding 19 by adding 20 and subtract-
ing 1) and interviewed them a week later and found each 
modiﬁ ed the taught strategy. The researcher interpreted 
the results as supportive of the constructivist approach 
because all three had the same instructional experience, 
but each had developed a slightly different understanding.
 
Montague and van Garderen (2003) compared the 
estimation strategies used by learning-disabled, average, 
and gifted students in the fourth, sixth, and eighth grades.  
They found that all three groups scored poorly on estima-
tion. However, the LD students used fewer strategies and 
were less successful overall than the average or gifted 
students.
 
Ainsworth, Bibby, and Wood (2002) worked with 
forty-eight 9- and 10-year-old students on their estimation 
skills using a computer program that provided feedback 
about the accuracy of their estimation. The program 
guided students’ estimation process using front-end 
and truncation strategies.  Students in the control group 
showed no improvement, but students with pictorial and 
numerical feedback reduced the number of errors in their 
estimation. Differences were found in student understand-
ing of the pictorial and numerical representations.

Patterns
Looking for patterns and relationships among num-
bers is fundamental to number sense and algebraic 
reasoning. Even before efﬁ cient algorithms, people 
studied number lore and the relationships among 
numbers. Many computational puzzles and games 
are based on relationships between numbers.
Intermediate-grade students can explore a wider 
variety of patterns, including increasing and de-
creasing patterns. They encounter these in many 
situations as they explore geometry and fractions. 
The ancient Greeks thought of numbers as geomet-
ric in nature. Square numbers are those numbers 
that form squares, and cubic numbers form cubes. 
For example, 4 tiles form a 2  2 square and 9 tiles 
make a 3  3 square; 8 cubes form a 2  2  2 cube 
and 27 cubes form a 3  3  3 cube.

Another sequence, called the Fibonacci se-
quence, describes the growth of plants and other 
natural phenomena: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . .
In the primary grades students recognize odd 
and even numbers. In the intermediate grades chil-
dren discover odd and even rules for number op-
erations. In the following vignette Mr. Greene pro-
vides examples and asks questions so students can 
ﬁ nd a rule that will help them think about number 
combinations.
Mr. Greene: I am going to put some addition 
examples on the board. I want you to look at the 
numbers and the answers to see if you can ﬁ nd a 
pattern or rule for each group.

numbers.
Emily: She is right. All the numbers are even, the 
addends and the answers.
Mr. Greene: What rule could we write about add-
ing even numbers?
Catasha: When you add two even numbers, the 
answer is even?
Josh: What about adding three even numbers?
Dahntey: I tried three even numbers, and the 
answer is even.
Mr. Greene: Can you ﬁ nd any examples when our 
rule for adding even numbers does not work?
Other rules can be derived in a similar manner 
by giving examples.
•  The quotient of two even numbers is always even.
•  The difference between an odd number and an 
even number is an odd number.
•  The product of two odd numbers is an odd 
number.
•  The sum of one odd number and one even num-
ber is odd.

Prime and Composite Numbers
Work with prime and composite numbers extends 
understanding of factors, divisors, and multiples 
encountered in the study of multiplication and di-
vision. Some numbers have several factors and are 
called composite numbers. Other numbers that 
have only one set of factors—the number 1 and it-
self—are called prime numbers. Activity 10.12 al-
lows students to investigate array patterns and fac-
tors with cubes and disks. A large classroom chart 
shows numbers from 1 to 30 and identiﬁ es numbers 
with only one set of factors and numbers with mul-
tiple sets of factors.
A composite number is factored completely 
when all the factors are prime numbers. When 18 is 
factored, it is expressed as 2  3  3; 36 is factored 
as 2  2  3  3. Finding factors by examination is 
easy when the product is one of the basic multiplica-
E

tion facts and has only two factors, such as 4, 6, 15, 
and 63. However when factoring 12, children might 
name either 2  6 or 3  4, but they are not ﬁ nished; 
because one of the factors is not prime, further fac-
toring is needed to ﬁ nd that the prime factorization 
for 12 is 2  2  3.
Factor trees are suitable for larger numbers. Fac-
tor trees are created by expressing a composite 
number in terms of successively smaller factors un-
til all factors are prime numbers. The process is de-
scribed in Activity 10.13, where different factor trees 
for 24 are developed.
Activity 10.14 shows how to ﬁ nd prime and com-
posite numbers not already known by students us-
ing the sieve of Eratosthenes. Eratosthenes, a Greek 
astronomer and geographer who lived in the third 
century B.C., devised a scheme for separating any 
set of consecutive whole numbers larger than 1 into 
prime and composite numbers. Interested students 
can extend the sieve process for larger numbers. 
Some students might search for twin primes, such as 
3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, which have only one com-
posite number between them. Challenge students to 
ﬁ nd other twin primes between 100 and 300. Work 
with the sieve is a good place to incorporate the cal-
culator to reduce the drudgery of calculation and 
emphasize the mathematical pattern.
Integers
Numbers used for counting discrete quantities 
are called whole numbers. In other situations 
numbers are needed that express values less than 0 
as well. The temperature may be below 0 degrees 
(Fig ure 10.7a); Death Valley is lower than sea level, 
which is considered 0 (Figure 10.7b); and a check 
written on insufﬁ cient funds can put the checking 
account below 0, commonly called in the red (Fig-
ure 10.7c). A football team may lose yardage on a

Prime and Composite Numbers (Reasoning and Representation)
Level: Grades 3– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students use arrays to ﬁ nd factors of numbers.
Materials: Tiles or other counting materials
•  Have students put six tiles in all possible rectangular row 
and column arrangements that they can find. Label the 
arrays with the factors of 6.
•  When students understand the task, have them arrange 
sets from 1 through 20 tiles in arrays.
•  Put the results of the student exploration in a table listing 
the factors for each number 1 through 20.
•  Ask students to examine the table. “Some whole num-
bers—2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17—have only two arrays, such as 
5: 1  5, 5  1.” “5  1 and 1  5 are really the same.” 
“The arrays are just one line.” “Other numbers have 
several arrays.” “They can be arranged in one or more 
rectangular patterns as well as in straight lines.”
•  Introduce the terms prime numbers for numbers that have 
only one set of factors (1  5 and 5  1) and composite 
numbers for numbers with more than one set of factors 
(2  3, 3  2 and 1  6 and 6  1).
•  Ask students what they notice about all the factors of 
prime numbers.

ite and why. Research the answer on the Internet.

play or penalty, and contestants go “in the hole” on 
some television quiz programs.
Positive and negative numbers are part of the 
integer number system. Number lines can be ex-
tended to the left past 0. The same rules of number 
sequence, magnitude, and more than and less than 
apply to negative integers. When comparing whole 
numbers, children see that numbers increase as you 
move to the right and decrease to the left. When you 
move past 0 to the left, the numbers become nega-
tive and their negative value increases. Negative 
temperatures get colder and colder as the tempera-
ture moves away from zero: 20 degrees is colder 
than 10 degrees. Similarly, negative bank balances 
get worse as the balance moves down from zero: 
$200 is worse than $10.

Factor Trees (Representation)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students use a factor tree to ﬁ nd prime factors.
Materials: Chalkboard and chalk
•  Write 24 on the chalkboard. Ask: “What are two numbers 
that when multiplied have a product of 24?” Accept 1  
24, and write it to the side. Ask for another set of factors.
•  Write factors beneath their product.
•  Ask if either of the factors can be factored again.
•  Complete one factor tree for 24.
•  Write 24 again, and ask if 24 has two other factors not 
used in the ﬁ rst example. Complete the second factor 
tree.
•  Write 24 a third time, and ask for factors. Complete the 
third factor tree.
•  Ask what students notice about all the factor trees. (An-
swer: They all have the same factors even if they are writ-
ten in different orders. Every composite number has only 
one set of prime factors, a rule called the fundamental 
theorem of arithmetic.)
•  Ask why you did not use 24  1 as a starting place.
•  Ask students to make factor trees with other numbers 
from 10 to 100, and post them on the board. Write prime 
numbers that they ﬁ nd on one side of a poster or bulletin 
board and composite numbers on the other side.

In elementary school teachers can introduce 
the idea of negative number situations with money, 
football, temperature, and the number line. Activi-
ties provide background for understanding posi-
tive and negative integers and their symbols, such 
as 4 and 4. The use of these signs may lead to 
confusion with addition and subtraction signs. For 
this and other reasons, formal work with integers is 
now recommended for middle school rather than 
elementary school students. Some simple activities 
based on pairing positive and negative numbers in-
troduce operations. Red chips are positive numbers 
and blue chips are negative integers. The format for 
positive and negative numbers should show super-
script plus and minus signs for positive and negative 
to distinguish the signs from regular plus and minus 
signs for addition and subtraction. Adding three red 
and three blue chips creates a sum of zero because 
each positive chip and negative chip pair has a sum 
of zero. Students may call the chips matter and anti-
matter to show that they cancel each other out.
ACTIVITY 10.14
 
Sieve of Eratosthenes (Reasoning)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students identify composite and prime numbers.
Materials: Hundreds chart (see Black-Line Master 10.1)
•  Ask students to put a square around 1 on the chart 
because 1 is a factor of all numbers including itself. It is 
neither prime nor composite.
•  Go to 2 on the chart, circle it, and cross out all the mul-
tiples of 2 up to 100.
•  Go to 3, circle it, and cross out multiples of 3 on the chart.
•  Go to 4, and ask why all the multiples of 4 are already 
crossed out. (Answer: They are all multiples of 2.)
•  Go to 5. Ask students whether 5 is prime or composite, 
and how they know. Circle 5, and cross out the multiples 
of 5 that remain.
•  Let students continue circling prime numbers and crossing 
out multiples. Have them post their hundreds charts with 
prime numbers circled and other numbers marked out. 
Have them compare their charts to see if they agree or 
disagree. After discussion, have students prepare a list of 
all prime numbers under 100.
Variations
•  Find prime numbers between 100 and 200, or larger.
•  In 2003 the largest prime number was found to contain 
2,090,960 digits. Search the Internet for the largest prime 
number known.
•  Look on the Internet for uses of prime numbers.

Take-Home Activities
Take-home letters invite parents to extend and 
support student learning. Both of these letters ask 
parents to engage children with numbers at home. 
Because connections is one of the process stan-
dards in Principles and Standards for School Mathe-
matics (National Council of Teachers of Mathemat-
ics, 2000), students need to see how numbers are 
used in real life. The ﬁ rst letter suggests ways that 
parents can talk with students about numbers in 
the grocery store, on television, and in games. The 
second letter asks parents to work with students to 
complete an extension of a classroom project.
Numbers All Around
Dear Parents,
Your child is learning about counting and numbers at school. Numbers and 
counting are also important in the child’s home life. Help your child see how 
numbers are used every day by playing games, asking questions, and talking 
about numbers. Here are some suggestions.
 1. Numbers in the grocery store:
 
 Ask which brand of bread is more expensive.
 
 Find items that are on sale. Ask how much you can save.
 
 Estimate how much you have bought, and compare it to the register total.
 2. Numbers on television:
 
 Ask which channels broadcast special shows.
 
 Ask when certain programs begin and end.
 
  Ask how much money people are winning on Wheel of Fortune or 
Jeopardy.
 3. Numbers in games:
 
 Play card games, such as Battle, that compare number values.
 
  Play card games, such as Gin, that match numbers or put numbers in 
sequence.
 
  Play dominoes. You can begin by matching dots and later introduce 
scoring.
 
 Play Yahtzee or Junior Yahtzee.
These simple activities can be fun for you and your child. Next month, we 
will be having a math game night to introduce more games that you and your 
child can play.

Big Number Hunt
Dear Parents,
For the past three weeks, the fourth- and ﬁ fth-graders have been studying 
numbers larger than 10,000. Children have learned about millions, billions, 
and trillions. Here are some examples we have found:
•  Man wins $31,000,000 in lottery.
•  The tanker spilled more than 4,000,000 gallons of crude oil; 16,000,000 gal-
lons are still on board.
•  The airplane ﬂ ies at 45,000 feet.
This week everyone is hunting for ﬁ ve large numbers in newspapers, on the 
Internet, or from any other source to add to our big number collection. We 
will use them for comparing and classifying, for making big number books, 
and in rounding and estimating. You can work together with your child to ﬁ nd 
big numbers. On Thursday we are planning a big number circus.

Summary
Number sense is an awareness of numbers in daily life 
and an understanding of how they work. Children with 
many experiences develop an understanding of numbers 
and of the Hindu-Arabic, or base-10, numeration system; 
they are able to think about numbers as well as compute 
with them. The Hindu-Arabic numeration system is a 
place-value system based on multiples of 10 that can rep-
resent large numbers efﬁ ciently. The system, which was 
developed over centuries, also allows the use of efﬁ cient 
algorithms in computation.
After developing basic number concepts up to 20 with 
objects, pictures, and numerals, children are ready to ex-
tend their knowledge to larger numbers in the hundreds or 
thousands. Through modeling with Uniﬁ x cubes, bundled 
tongue depressors, base-10 and Cuisenaire materials, and 
bean sticks, students can see the relative size of numbers 
and recognize the structure and rules of the Hindu-Arabic 
numeration system. The base-10 system accommodates 
numbers of all sizes; millions and billions adhere to the 
same rules as smaller numbers. They can represent large 
numbers in both compact and expanded forms.
At the same time children learn the number system, 
they develop number awareness and number sense. 
They become aware of the many uses of numbers in 
their world and develop ﬂ exible thinking about using 
numbers. Answers do not always need to be exact. Stu-
dents learn that some answers can be “close enough” to 
keep their meaning. Rounding and estimation are two 
skills that allow students to draw reasonable conclusions 
about the precision needed for numbers. Other relation-
ships about numbers and the number system are also ex-
plored: number patterns, prime and composite numbers, 
and positive and negative integers.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Number awareness and number sense are major 
goals of instruction in numbers. How aware of num-
bers are you in everyday life? Do you notice how 
much groceries cost? how much you tip a server? 
how long you wait on line? how much you save on a 
sale?
 2.  Use one of the base-10 materials to represent the fol-
lowing numbers:
  a. 128
  b. 478
  c. 397
  d. 1,153
   If you do not have access to a set of commercial 
materials, such as Cuisenaire rods or Uniﬁ x cubes, 
draw a diagram to show the numbers.
 3.  List two examples of when you round numbers and 
estimate. How comfortable and skilled are you with 
rounding and estimating?
Using the Technology Center
The activities described here (courtesy of Texas Instru-
ments, Dallas, Texas) are examples of how both pri-
mary- and intermediate-grade students can use calcula-
tors to enhance their understanding of numbers.
Calculator Counting
Students work with a calculator singly or in pairs. Tell 
students that they are to ﬁ gure out how to make the cal-
culator count by ones. When they have done this, have 
them count by twos, ﬁ ves, tens, or any other number. 
Give challenges: “Can you count by ﬁ ves to 500 in a 
minute?” Have one child time the other with the second 
hand on a classroom clock or another timepiece. “Tell 
me how many numbers are in each of these sequences: 
8, 15, 22, . . . , 113; 10, 19, 28, . . . , 118.” Young children 
can see numbers “grow” by entering a number—say, 
453—then pressing , then 1, entering 100, pressing , 
then 1, and so on. Older children can do the same activ-
ity with a number such as 43,482 and repeatedly adding 
1,000. Stop the activity periodically to discuss what hap-
pens. Ask: “How many times do you press the equals 
key to go from 436 to 536 when you repeatedly add 10? 
How many hundreds are 10 tens?” “How much larger 
is 23,481 after you add 100 ten times? Ten hundreds are 
equal to how many thousands?”
Wipeout
This activity can be 
used with place value 
in larger numbers. 
Children work singly 
or in pairs. The object 
of the activity is to 
wipe out a number in 
a particular place-
value position. For 
example, when given 
a calculator showing 
the number 547, the 
student is to wipe out 
the 4 tens with one 
subtraction. To do 
this, the student must 
understand that the 
“4” represents 4 tens, 
or 40: 40 is subtracted 
from 547, leaving 507. 
Numbers in any place-
value position other 
than the extreme left 
or right can be wiped 
out. The size of numbers should increase as children 
mature; older students can use numbers in the millions.

Developing 
Number 
Operations with 
Whole Numbers
s elementary students work with objects, they encounter 
problems that require combining and separating them. 
They add the value of coins to pay for a snack; they re-
move animals from the farm diorama; they skip-count 
the number of shoes in the class by 2’s; and they share 
a bag of cookies equally among their friends. Realistic situations such as 
these introduce number operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. With a strong conceptual base through stories, models with 
manipulatives, pictures, and symbolic representations, students build an un-
derstanding of how each operation works and learn the strategies that lead 
to computational skill with basic facts. Building conceptual and strategic 
understanding makes mastery of the facts a successful ﬁ rst step in computa-
tional ﬂ uency. Chapter 12 extends the number operations to larger numbers, 
computational algorithms, and estimation strategies.
In this chapter you will read about:
1  Curriculum standards for number operations with whole numbers
2  The importance of problem solving in learning number operations
3  The situations and actions associated with addition and subtraction 
and activities to model and develop the concepts

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Building Number Operations
Addition and subtraction situations are part of ev-
eryday life for children. Examples of the ways that 
children use addition and subtraction every day 
include:
•  Adding to determine the number of boys and girls 
in the class.
•  Determining the number of blue and red blocks 
in a tower.
•  Paying for food at the market with bills and get-
ting change.
•  Comparing one’s own allowance to a friend’s 
allowance.
Multiplication and division events are also com-
mon in children’s lives. For instance, in kindergar-
ten each child gets a juice box and three crackers 
during snack time and the total number of crack-
ers must be computed; at the grocery store with a 
parent, children see that each orange costs 50 cents 
and six oranges are purchased; or at home a pizza 
is delivered and it is cut into eight pieces.
Experiences with combining, removing, and 
sharing provide realistic contexts for number op-
erations. As children tell stories, draw pictures, and 
write number sentences, they explore number pat-
terns and relationships leading to properties and 
strategies for number combinations. Then students 
extend their skill to computational procedures for 
larger numbers and continue work on number sense 
with rounding, estimation, and reasonableness. In 
the elementary grades the goal for children is com-
putational ﬂ uency.
The approach to teaching number operations 
and number sense has changed in contemporary 
mathematics programs. In the past, number opera-
tions were often taught only as memorized facts for 
each operation. Then a few dreaded story problems 
were placed at the end of the chapter. Today, prob-
lems are posed in realistic settings that require stu-
dents to consider the relationships among numbers. 
As they solve problems, children learn the four num-
ber operations and the basic facts that are critical 
for all computational procedures. When children 
understand how numbers work together, they have 
a foundation for large number operations using com-
putational strategies such as estimation and reason-
ableness, whether they are working on paper or with 
calculators.
What Students Need to Learn 
About Number Operations
The NCTM standards for number and operations 
identify three broad expectations for students in 
prekindergarten through grade 5 (National Council 
of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000):
1.  To understand numbers, ways of representing 
numbers, relationships among numbers, and 
number systems.
  6     Situations and actions for multiplication and division and ways and 
activities to model and develop the concepts
  7    Properties of multiplication and division and their uses
  8    Interpretation of remainders in division in different situations
  9    Strategies for learning multiplication and division facts
10     Guidelines for developing accuracy and speed with number 
combinations

2.  To understand meanings of operations and how 
they relate to one another.
3.  To compute ﬂ uently and make reasonable 
estimates.
The complete standards are the following:
NCTM Standards for Number 
and Operations
Pre-K– 2 Expectations
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  develop a sense of whole numbers and represent and use 
them in ﬂ exible ways, including relating, composing, and 
decomposing numbers;
•  understand various meanings of addition and subtraction 
of whole numbers and the relationship between the two 
operations;
•  understand the effects of adding and subtracting whole 
numbers;
•  understand situations that entail multiplication and di-
vision, such as equal groupings of objects and sharing 
equally;
•  develop and use strategies for whole-number computa-
tions, with a focus on addition and subtraction;
•  develop ﬂ uency with basic number combinations for ad-
dition and subtraction;
•  use a variety of methods and tools to compute, includ-
ing objects, mental computation, estimation, paper and 
pencil, and calculators.
Grades 3– 5 Expectations
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  understand various meanings of multiplication and 
division;
•  understand the effects of multiplying and dividing whole 
numbers;
•  identify and use relationships between operations, 
such as division as the inverse of multiplication, to solve 
problems;
•  understand and use properties of operations, such as the 
distributivity of multiplication over addition;
•  develop ﬂ uency with basic number combinations for multi -
plication and division and use these combinations to men-
tally compute related problems, such as 30  50;
•  develop ﬂ uency in adding, subtracting, multiplying, and 
dividing whole numbers.
Developing proﬁ ciency with number operations 
proceeds through four interrelated phases:
1.  Exploring concepts and number combinations 
through realistic stories, with materials, and 
through representations of situations using pic-
tures and number sentences.
2.  Learning strategies and properties of each op-
eration for number combinations.
3.  Developing accuracy and speed with basic 
facts.
4.  Extending concepts and skills for each opera-
tion with large numbers to gain computational 
ﬂ uency.
The ﬁ rst three steps to proﬁ ciency with num -
ber operations occur chieﬂ y in the primary grades 
but continue throughout the elementary grades. 
Table 11.1 illustrates how the concepts and skills 
build over the elementary grades. Basic facts are 
important for computational ﬂ uency, but knowing 
when and where the operations are used to solve 
problems is equally important. In the upper grades 
of elementary school place-value concepts join 
with understanding of addition and subtraction so 
that children extend their understanding of whole-
number operations to larger numbers, including esti-
mation, algorithms, calculators, and number sense. 
Extending whole-number operations to larger num-
bers is found in Chapter 12.
When students understand operations, they are 
empowered to solve a wide variety of problems 
and gain conﬁ dence as they attempt more complex 
problems in later grades. Fluency and ﬂ exibility 
with numbers extend students’ understanding of 
numbers to algebraic situations.
Standards and grade-level expectations are guide-
lines for teachers. Individual children, however, learn 
number operations at different rates and in differ -
ent manners. In a third-grade classroom one child 
might count objects for addition, whereas another 
might estimate sums in the millions. Teachers face 
the constant issue of balancing the expectations 
of the curriculum and the needs of individual 
children.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
What Teachers Need to Know 
About Addition and Subtraction
As teachers begin their work with addition and sub-
traction, they introduce students to stories that illus-
trate the situations, meanings, and actions associ-
ated with the operations.
Addition is the action of joining two or more sets.
•  Juan has four red pencils and three blue pencils.
•  Heather has 37 books in her library. She receives 
ﬁ ve books as presents for her birthday.
•  The school collection for earthquake victims was 
$149 on Friday and $126 on Saturday.
The natural question is how many or how much is 
in the joined set. In each situation the total, or sum, 
is found by combining the number of pencils, the 
number of books, or the amount of money collected 
on Friday and Saturday. The numbers related to each 
set being joined are addends.
In contrast to addition with one action, subtrac-
tion is used to solve four problem situations.
1.  Takeaway: Removing part of a set.
2.  Whole-part-part: Separating a set into subsets.

3.  Comparison: Showing the difference between 
two sets.
4.  Completion: Finding the missing part needed to 
ﬁ nish a set.
Takeaway subtraction is used when part of an 
original set is moved, lost, eaten, or spent.
•  Jeff collects wheelie cars. He had 16, but traded 3 
of them for a new track.
•  Janyce had $94 saved from birthday money. She 
spent $33 on new shoes, $14 for a new top, and 
$27 for a new skirt.
•  Jamal had 36 cookies. He gave two cookies each 
to 12 friends.
In takeaway situations the question or problem 
asks how much is left or how many are left after 
part of the set is removed. The answer is called the 
remainder.
Whole-part-part subtraction identiﬁ es the 
size of a subgroup within a larger group. The whole 
group has a common characteristic, but parts or 
subgroups have distinct characteristics.
•  The class has 25 children. Fourteen are girls.
•  Deidre has 17 stuffed animals. Fourteen are bears.
•  Sally has 48 snapdragons. Thirty of them are 
white. The rest are yellow.
•  Darius counted 114 people at the family reunion. 
Forty-nine had his same last name.
Whole-part-part subtraction identiﬁ es membership 
in two subgroups that are included in the whole 
group. The number in one part of the whole is 
known, and the question posed is how many belong 
in the other part. In whole-part-part stories no items 
are removed or lost, as in takeaway situations.
Comparison subtraction, not surprisingly, 
compares the size of two sets or the measure of two 
objects. The quantity of both sets or measurement 
of both objects is known.
•  In the NBA game the shortest player is 5 feet, 
3 inches, and the tallest player is 7 feet, 6 inches.

•  On Friday, $149 was collected for ﬂ ood victims; 
on Saturday, $126 was collected.
•  The circus put on two performances. The matinee 
was attended by 8,958 people, and the evening 
performance attracted 9,348 people.
The comparison question in subtraction asks how 
much larger or how much smaller one set is than the 
other. “What is the difference?” is another way of 
expressing comparison between the two sets.
Completion is similar to comparison in that two 
sets are being compared. However, in completion 
situations the comparison is between an existing set 
and a desired set or between an incomplete set and 
a completed set.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
•  Saundra has saved $9. The CD she 
wants costs $16.
•  Shaeffer is collecting state quarters. He 
already has 23.
•  Mr. Lopez is making lemonade for the 
party. The recipe calls for 3 cups of 
water for each can of concentrate. He 
used 6 cans of concentrate and has put 
in 10 cups of water so far.
The question for completion stories is how 
many more are needed or how much more 
is needed. Completion is subtraction be-
cause the total 
and one addend 
are known, and 
the other ad-
dend 
repre-
sents the part 
of the set that is 
needed or miss-
ing. Completion 
problems 
can 
be written in 
subtraction form, for ex-
ample, 9  5  ?, but are 
sometimes written as ad-
dition sentences, 5  ?  
9, called the missing-
addend form.
Developing Concepts 
of Addition and Subtraction
Understanding of addition and subtraction concepts 
and procedures develops through children’s infor-
mal experiences with numbers. During play, chil-
dren share cookies, count blocks, compare heights 
and distances, complete sets, and classify objects by 
attributes. Without rich mathematical experiences 
children have a weak foundation for mathemati-
cal concepts and skills. Early childhood teachers 
provide many informal experiences that help build 
children’s experiential background for numbers and 
operations. Children’s intuitive understanding of ad-
dition and subtraction builds on counting skills to 
10 and beyond.
•  Throw six beanbags in the basket. Now throw 
two more. Count how many beanbags are in the 
basket now.
•  You have nine leaves in your box. When you take 
three out, how many are left in the box?
•  One Uniﬁ x tower has nine red blocks, and an-
other tower has six green blocks. Which one is 
taller? How much taller is it?
•  We have 12 napkins and 15 children. How many 
more napkins do we need?
Many children’s books engage students with 
numbers in active ways as they hear the stories, 
count pictures, and search for pictures that comple-
ment the text. A walk-on number line models addi-
tion and subtraction kinesthetically. Addition is a 
forward movement on the number line, and subtrac-
tion reverses the action.
Introducing Addition
Addition is a process of combining sets of objects 
and is introduced through story situations that pose 
a problem to be solved. After hearing the number 
problem, children act out the story with physical ob-
jects and ﬁ nd the results.
•  I had two apples in a bowl. Then I put in three 
oranges.
After actions with physical models are developed, 
the same stories can be represented with simple 
pictures or diagrams. Then the situation is recorded 
symbolically with numerals and mathematical 
signs.
•  Two apples and three oranges are ﬁ ve pieces of 
fruit: 2  3  5.
This process is repeated with different stories. Stu-
dents gain understanding and conﬁ dence with ad-

MISCONCEPTION
Many students have dif-
ﬁ culty with the missing-
addend form. First, the 
problem is subtraction 
but is written as addition. 
Second, many children 
do not understand the 
meaning of the equal sign 
as balancing the two sides 
of the number sentences. 
Students who have had 
experience with balanc-
ing scales will be more 
comfortable with adding 
numbers to either side of 
the equation to achieve 
balance.

ACTIVITY 11.2
 
More Cats (Representation and Communication)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students model addition.
Materials: So Many Cats! by Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, illus-
trated by Ellen Weiss (New York: Clarion Books 1985); pictures of 
cats; magnetic numbers and symbols
So Many Cats! describes how a family collected cats. 
They started with one, but more cats arrived, and none 
could be resisted. After each new arrival, the cats are 
counted again. The book ends with yet another cat at the 
window.
•  Read through the book once. On the second reading have 
children count each time new cats appear. Pictures of cats 
can be placed on the board rail to show the number of 
cats.
•  Talk about the progressive accumulation of cats. “They 
had three, and three more came.” “They had six, and two 
more came.”
•  As students are ready, write addition sentences as each 
new cat or cats arrive (e.g., 6  2  8).
•  Have children tell a progressive story, real or imaginary, 
about pets (e.g., “I had one frog, then two alligators 
followed me home.”). Each child can add new animals to 
the story. Children may model stories using pictures or 
counters and write addition sentences.
Extension
•  Invent new stories about cats that come or leave. Ask the 
children to model how many cats there are as you tell the 
story. Begin with one or two cats arriving or leaving at a 
time, and progress to larger numbers. Discuss how many 
cat eyes or cat paws are in the house with the addition or 
subtraction of cats as a foundation for multiplication.
dition represented in physical, pictorial, oral, and 
written forms that will lead to images of addition 
and mental operations.
Activity 11.1 presents addition situations with fa-
miliar objects. Story problems introduce concepts 
by having students act out the situation described. 
Activity 11.2, based on So Many Cats! by Beatrice 
Schenk de Regniers, illustrates addition as more and 
more cats arrive at a house.
Concrete materials and realistic situations for ad-
dition and subtraction allow the teacher to draw on 
the environment and experience of students from 
varying backgrounds. Stories can be personalized 
with familiar names and situations. Some students

Solving Problems with Addition (Representation)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Small group or whole class
Objective: Students demonstrate addition by joining objects con-
tained in two or more groups.
Materials: Stuffed animals (or other suitable objects), books, math 
box materials
•  Begin with a story about some stuffed toys: “I like to col-
lect stuffed animals. I recently went looking for them at 
garage sales. I found these two at one house (show two 
animals) and these three at another house (show three 
more animals). How many stuffed animals did I ﬁ nd?”
•  Ask students to tell how they determined the answer. 
They might say, “I counted,” “I counted two more, begin-
ning at 3,” “I just looked and knew.”
•  Repeat with other familiar objects, such as books and 
pencils.
•  Have children work in pairs with math box materials to 
share “joining” stories. Take turns making up stories.
•  Introduce the combining board for addition. Students put 
the objects in the two rectangles and pull them down into 
the larger rectangle.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
advance quickly to more symbolic representations; 
others remain at the concrete level longer. Children 
need not be hurried to represent addition and sub-
traction with symbols because they can use num-
ber combinations cards, such as 2  3, to label the 
joined sets.
After modeling addition stories and actions with 
concrete materials, introduce the addition sentence 
2  3  5, read “two plus three equals ﬁ ve.” When 
written below the word sentence, the plus sign takes 
the place of “and” and the equal sign substitutes 
for “are” or “equals.” Working with objects, pictures, 
and number cards prepares students to write addi-
tion sentences alone or with a partner. One child 
might separate beads strung on a card or wire into 
two sets, and the other would respond “Three plus 
ﬁ ve equals eight” or write “3  5  8” (Figure 11.1). 
Many other activities demonstrate addition. 
Beans painted different colors are good for explor-
ing number combinations (Figure 11.2a). One child 
puts seven beans painted red and blue in a cup and 
dumps them out on a paper saucer. The second 
child ﬁ nds and reads the number sentence card for 
the combination shown by the red and blue beans: 
4  3  7. Dominoes also represent addition com-
binations up to 6  6 (Figure 11.2b). Double domi-
noes represent addition facts up to 12  12. With 
Cuisenaire rods a child can select one length rod 
and build all the two-rod combinations of the same 
length. Combinations for the dark green rod are 
shown in Figure 11.2c. Sentences based on color 
(yellow  white  dark green) or number sentences 
(5  1  6) describe the combinations. As children 
are exploring the concept of addition and recording 
their ﬁ ndings, the teacher can introduce the terms 
addend and sum.

Figure 11.2 Addition demonstrations
Magnetic objects and a pan balance are sug-
gested in Activity 11.3 for modeling addition and in-
troducing the addition sentence with the equal sign. 
This activity also develops the algebraic concept of 
equality. Although adults understand that the equal 
sign means balanced or equal, many children do 
not understand that the equal sign means that the 
number combinations on each side of the equal 
sign are the same. Their understanding is more “do 
it now” rather than “is the same as.” In Activity 11.4 
the teacher demonstrates writing addition sentences 
with the equal sign.

ACTIVITY 11.3
 
Introducing the Equal Sign (Problem Solving and Representation)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Small groups or whole class
Objective: Students represent joining objects in two or more sets 
with the addition sentence.
Materials: Counting objects such as bears; pan balance; magnetic 
board objects, such as animal outlines or ﬂ owers; large magne-
tized numerals and equal sign for the magnetic board
•  Place several uniformed-weighted objects, such as small 
counting bears, on one side of a pan balance. Ask children 
what is needed to make the two sides level. They will 
answer, “Put some bears on the other side.”
•  Put bears on the other side of the pan balance one at a 
time so that gradually the balance is level.
•  Count the bears on each side to establish equality of 
number.
•  Introduce the equal sign to children, and explain that the 
equal sign indicates that the same amount is on both 
sides of the equal sign in the equation.
•  Ask children to make up and share other addition stories 
with objects or with the pan balance. They can select 
number sentence cards or write number sentences for 
their discoveries.
•  Place the pan balance in a learning center for students to 
experiment with different combinations.
•  An inexpensive number scale can also be purchased that 
has weighted numerals.
Children can explore balance by hanging 3 and 4 on one 
side of the scale and balancing it with 6 and 1. Make 
number sentence cards or a whiteboard available for 
recording.
Extension
•  Add the medium-size and large bears from sets of count-
ing bears to encourage exploration of equivalence by 
weight. This introduces the element of variability into the 
process because the bears have different weights. One 
large bear is equal to or weighs the same as three small 
bears.

ACTIVITY 11.4
 
Addition Sentence (Representation)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Whole class and pairs
Objective: Students represent joining objects in two or more sets 
with the addition sentence using an equal sign.
Materials: Various counters, such as interlocking cubes or two-
color counters; combining board from Activity 11.1; number 
sentence cards or whiteboards with markers.
•  Place three cars and four trucks on the magnetic board 
and tell a story about them. “Three red cars and four 
trucks were on the highway.” Tell the students that a 
number sentence represents the same story. Have one 
student put a 3 beneath the cars and a 4 beneath the 
trucks.
•  Place a plus sign between the 3 and the 4, and read 
“Three cars and four trucks.” Ask what the plus sign 
means.
•  Ask how many vehicles were on the highway. Place an 
equal sign and a 7 to complete the addition sentence, 
and read “Three cars and four trucks are equal to seven 
vehicles.” Ask students what the equal sign means. (An-
swer: 3 plus 4 is the same as 7.) Reply, “Seven is another 
name for three plus four.”
•  Reduce the number sentence to 3  4  7, and read 
“Three plus four equals seven.”
•  Ask students to work together to create more number 
stories and sentences. They may use the combining board 
from Activity 11.1. Ask them to ﬁ nd cards that match the 
addition stories they are telling or to write number sen-
tences on their whiteboards.

Place-value material activities (discussed in 
Chapter 10) can continue when operations are in-
troduced. Number combinations with sums greater 
than 10 should not present any great difﬁ culty as 
children count to 20, 30, and more. Children see 
that the numbers 11– 19 are combinations of ten and 
ones represented with Cuisenaire rods, bundles of 
stir sticks, and bean materials. With Cuisenaire rods 
a dark green (dg) rod and a black (bk) rod make a 
train equal in length to a train made with an orange 
(o) rod and three white (w) rods (Figure 11.3).
Introducing Subtraction
Subtraction, like addition, is introduced with real-
istic stories and is modeled with real objects and 
materials such as chips, blocks, and Uniﬁ x cubes. 
Takeaway stories are often the ﬁ rst of four subtrac-
tion actions presented.
•  I have six books. If I give two to Nia, how many 
books will I keep?
As children act out this story, ask how many books 
each has. Use of varied stories, objects, and num-
bers allows students to describe their actions and 
the results in many contexts.
•  Eight elephants were on the shore; three waded 
into the lake for a drink. How many were left on 
the shore?
Children can also illustrate stories with simple pic-
tures and record the results with a number sentence 
(8  3  5). As children make up new stories for 
subtraction, they see the relation between action 
and notation.
Subtraction is the inverse operation for addi-
tion; takeaway subtraction “undoes” addition. Other 
inverse operations can be modeled by opening and 
closing a door or by turning the lights on and off. Ac-
tivities for subtraction typically follow introduction 
of addition, but the connection between operations 
is easily modeled as sets are joined and separated. 
The inverse relationship between addition and sub-
traction can be modeled with stories, objects, and 
pictures.
•  Six adult elephants and two baby elephants were 
at the watering hole. The baby elephants got full 
and left the watering hole. How many were still 
drinking?

Teachers assess whether students understand 
the concept of addition by observing and question-
ing children as they work with materials, draw pic-
tures, tell stories, and write number sentences. A 
class checklist or rating scale in Figure 11.4 keeps a 
weekly record of student progress over time.

Children become familiar with mathematics 
symbols and develop an understanding of inverse 
operations as they connect the actions and their 
meanings. The plus sign indicates joining and is 
read “plus”; the minus sign indicates separation in 
the takeaway story and is read as “minus.”
Takeaway is one of four subtraction situations 
and should not be used as the name for the mi-
nus sign. The other subtraction situations are 
whole-part-part, comparison, and completion. Just 
as with addition and takeaway, children’s expe-
riences provide context for stories that are told, 
acted out, modeled, and recorded. When all types 
of subtraction stories are developed, students gain 
a broader understanding of subtraction. Students 
who have only been introduced to takeaway stories 
are frustrated when confronted by other subtraction 
types in a textbook or on tests.
Whole-part-part subtraction involves a whole set 
that is divided into subsets by some attribute.
•  Bill saw eight airplanes ﬂ y overhead. Five of the 
planes were painted red. How many of the planes 
were not red?
Plastic airplanes or counters or triangles can be 
used to represent the eight airplanes with ﬁ ve of 
them red. Children talk through the problem by de-
scribing what they see. “I see eight airplanes and 
ﬁ ve are red; three are not red.” Sorting activities 
are also a good time to highlight whole-part-part 
subtraction.
•  You have 15 buttons and 8 are gold. How many 
are not gold?
•  There are 22 boys and girls here today. Let’s count 
the boys. How many girls are here?
After several examples, children determine that 
they can write a subtraction number sentence for 
the stories. The sum is the whole and the addends 
are the two parts. Activity 11.5 describes how to 
ACTIVITY 11.5
 
How Many? (Representation)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Small groups or whole group
Objective: Students model whole-part-part subtraction.
Materials: How Many Snails? by Paul Giganti, illustrated by Donald 
Crew (New York: Greenwillow, 1988)
How Many Snails?—a picture counting book with pat-
terned text—has two-page pictures of dogs, or snails, or 
clouds with different characteristics. Children are asked 
to count the number of dogs, the number of spotted 
dogs, and the number of spotted dogs with their tongues 
out. The idea of whole-part-part is introduced.
•  The ﬁ rst encounter with the text will probably be as a 
counting book. The picture and text invite student partici-
pation; read one display at a time with students count-
ing the clouds (the whole group) and big, ﬂ uffy clouds 
(subgroup).
•  Following the initial presentation, read the book again 
and ask an additional question: “How many clouds are 
not big and ﬂ uffy?”
•  Ask students to tell the total number of clouds (8), the 
number of big, ﬂ uffy clouds (3), and the number of clouds 
that are not big and ﬂ uffy (5).
•  Write the number sentence 8  3  5. Ask what each 
number represents.
•  After reading several more pages, ask students to make 
their own picture for a page for a classroom book. 
Depending on their level, children may draw a picture 
or include the repetitive text on their own page. Share 
picture pages with the group, post them on the bulletin 
board, and make a classroom book.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
introduce whole-part-part subtraction using the 
book How Many Snails? by Paul Giganti.
Children have daily experiences comparing ages, 
amounts, and lengths. Their language already in-
cludes comparison words such as older, younger, 
bigger, smaller, taller, shorter, more, and less. Pre-
school children are often asked whether one set is 
bigger or smaller. Such comparison experiences and 
vocabulary provide the background for comparison 
subtraction.
•  Antoinette has 12 baseball cards; her brother has 
9. How many more cards does Antoinette have 
than her brother?

Show two sets of cards, and ask which set has more 
cards in it (the set with 12 cards) and which has 
fewer (the set with 9 cards). Matching the cards one 
to one shows three unmatched cards in the larger 
set. Count each set and ask, “How many more cards 
does Antoinette have? How can we write a subtrac-
tion sentence to show how many more cards Antoi-
nette has.” Write two statements:
Antoinette’s cards  brother’s cards  difference
12  9  3
The fourth subtraction situation, completion, 
is similar to comparison, but children often ﬁ nd it 
more difﬁ cult to understand. In comparison children 
see two existing sets, but completion compares an 
existing set with a desired set. The existing set is in-
complete and the problem or aim for the student is 
to complete the set.
•  Miguel has saved $6 for a CD. The CD costs $9.
•  Ari can get a free kite by saving nine lids from her 
favorite yogurt. She already has six lids.
Counting-on is a successful approach for comple-
tion problems. After telling the story of Miguel, put 
six play dollar bills or counters on a magnetic board. 
Ask, “How many dollars does Miguel need for the 
CD?” (Answer: 6.) Ask, “How many dollars does 
Miguel have?” (Answer: 9.) Let students count-on, 
“1, 2, 3” or “7, 8, 9,” as you place the three more dol-
lars or counters on the board. Finally, ask how many 
were added. (Answer: 3.) Activity 11.6 describes the 
counting-on strategy to solve completion situations.
Balancing is another strategy for the comple-
tion type of subtraction. Put nine disks on one side 
of a pan balance and six on the other side (Fig -
ure 11.5). Ask student to estimate how many more 
disks balance the scale, and count as you add disks. 
The number sentence can be written either as sub-
traction, 9  6  3, or as addition, 6  3  9. The 
missing addend is an algebraic equation form that 
shows that something is missing and needs to be 
balanced: 6  ?  9.
Completion subtraction with a balance scale
As important as modeling addition and sub-
traction with manipulatives is, activities alone do 
not guarantee meaningful learning. Like any tool, 
manipulatives are the means rather the ends of an 
activity. Discourse between students, and with a 
teacher, is essential for scaffolding mathematical 
ideas. Mathematical conversations encourage stu-
dents to transfer learning from short-term to long-
term memory. Drawing the subtraction stories is 
an important problem-solving strategy that helps 
students understand how subtraction works. Each 
story situation demands a slightly different picture. 
Students may need help to draw the story rather than 
the number sentence. In takeaway or whole-part-
part subtraction the student draws the total number 
and identiﬁ es a part that is removed or a part that 
belongs to a subgroup of the total. For comparison 
and completion problems children model or draw 
two sets and show how they compare or measure 
with each other. Students may want to draw both 
the sum and the addend. Help students depict the 
story ﬁ rst; then write the number sentence as a sum-
mary of the story situation.

•  Six children were at the party. Two went home.
If the children start by writing 6  2, the picture they 
draw may not accurately show the story. Pictures are 
a problem-solving strategy that students use to un-
derstand the problem and develop a plan. Starting 
with addition and subtraction situations, children 
learn that accurate representation of the story is im-
portant (Figure 11.6).
Vertical Notation
Early in learning number operations, mathematical 
sentences are recorded horizontally, like a word sen-
tence. The horizontal form has two beneﬁ ts:
1.  The order of numerals in a sentence is the same 
as the verbal description and reinforces the 
meaning of a problem story. Joining three 
apples and four apples is described as “I had 
three apples and got four more. I now have 
seven apples.” The mathematical sentence is 
3  4  7.
2.  Horizontal notation is later used for formulas 
and algebraic expressions.
Making the transition is not difﬁ cult when atten tion 
is paid to the meaning and order of the stories being 
recorded. Compare two addition situations.
•  Four parents were watching soccer practice. Then 
six more joined them. 4  6  ?
•  Six parents were sitting in the stands watching 
soccer. Four more joined them. 6  4  ?

Counting On (Problem Solving and Reasoning)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students use counting-on strategies to learn subtraction 
facts.
Materials: Counting-on cards, counters, or painted lima beans
•  The counting-on strategy is one way to have children 
conceptualize how many more of something are needed. 
It is best used when the difference between two numbers 
is relatively small, such as in 9  2  7.
•  Tell a story: “Janell has $5, but the CD she wants costs 
$8. How much more money does she need?” Show a 
counting-on card with eight circles, ﬁ ve ﬁ lled in and three 
blank. Ask what the ﬁ ve stands for, and the three. (An-
swer: She has ﬁ ve; she needs three more.) Use the card to 
illustrate how to count on from 5: “6, 7, 8.”
•  Have students model the situation with counters or beans. 
Each child counts ﬁ ve showing one color and three of 
another color.
•  Follow the action by having children say the appropriate 
sentence for the combination: “She wants eight, she 
has ﬁ ve, she needs three more; eight minus ﬁ ve equals 
three.”
•  Repeat with similar stories, counting-on cards, and 
manipulatives.

•  With beans (or other objects) and small cups, label each 
cup with numerals 1 through 18. Put the corresponding 
number of beans in each cup. Remove a few beans from 
the cup, and put them on the table. Ask how many more 
counters are in the cup to complete the number in the set.

ACTIVITY 11.7
 
Vertical Form (Representation)
Level: Grades 1 and 2
Setting: Small groups or whole class
Objective: Students use horizontal and vertical notation for 
addition.
Materials: Magnetic board shapes; numerals; , , and  signs
•  Tell the following story: “Two children were playing kick 
ball and four more joined the game.” Arrange two sets 
of shapes in a horizontal row on a magnetic board. Ask 
children to use magnetic numerals and symbols to write 
the number sentence for the objects. Read the sentence: 
“Two plus four equals six.”
•  Rearrange the shapes to form a vertical column. Put 
two shapes at the top and the other four beneath. 
Ask whether the number of shapes has changed. 
(Answer: No.) Ask what has changed. (Answer: The 
arrangement.)
•  Transform the number sentence from horizontal to vertical 
also. Put the numerals alongside the shapes with the plus 
sign to the left of the bottom numeral. Read the sentence: 
“Two plus four equals six.”
•  Tell other stories and have students represent them with 
magnetic shapes and numbers in both horizontal to verti-
cal form.
Assessment
•  Ask children to draw pictures for an addition and a sub-
traction story, and record the numbers for the problem in 
horizontal and vertical form.
When the horizontal number sentence and its mean-
ing are established, students are introduced to the 
vertical, or stacked, notation form. The number sen-
tences 4  6  10 and 6  4  10, respectively, are 
written in stacked form:
 
4 
6
 
6 
4
 
10 
10
Preserving the order of the numbers from hori-
zontal sentences to stacked forms reinforces the 
logic of the story. A magnetic board with moveable 
numbers allows for easy translation of the numbers 
from horizontal to vertical notation, as seen in Activ-
ity 11.7.
Order in subtraction sentences is more critical 
because subtraction is not commutative.
•  Four parents were watching soccer practice. Two 
had to leave early. 4  2  2.
 
4
 
2
 
2
Although 2  4 is a valid sentence with negative in-
tegers, it does not describe this story.
Simple addition and subtraction problems can 
be presented in either form; however, as students 
work with larger numbers, alignment of place values 
shows the advantage of vertical notation.
What Teachers Need to Know 
About Properties of Addition 
and Subtraction
As students work with addition and subtraction, 
the properties of the operations should be empha-
sized because they are so important in learning the 
basic facts. The commutative property of addi-
tion states that the order of the addends does not 
affect the sum.
Commutative law: 2  3  3  2
 
n1  n2  n2  n1
Subtraction is not commutative: 7  6 is not equal 
to 6  7.
The associative property of addition applies 
to three or more addends. Addition is a binary op-
eration involving two addends. When working with 
three or more addends, two are added, then an-
other addend is added, and another, until the sum 
is determined. If the problem shows the associative 
property, the order in which pairs of addends are 
added does not change the sum. Subtraction is not 
associative.
Associative law: 8  (2  3)  (8  2)  3
 
a  (b  c)  (a  b)  c
200 
Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving

 
Chapter 11 Developing Number Operations with Whole Numbers 
201
When adding ﬁ ve addends, such as 4  5  3  6 
 7, the commutative and associative laws work to-
gether to make addition easier by ﬁ nding combina-
tions of 10: 4  6 is 10; 7  3 is 10; 10  10  5 is 25. 
Looking for easy combinations of 10, 100, or 1,000 is 
a mental computation strategy called compatible 
numbers.
Zero is the identity element for both addition 
and subtraction because adding or subtracting zero 
does not change the sum. When working with con-
crete materials, students model stories with zero and 
ﬁ nd that zero does not change the sum regardless of 
the size of the number.
Identity element: 
5  0  5 
72  0  72
 
n  0  n 
 n  0  n
Learning Strategies for Addition 
and Subtraction Facts
As children gain understanding and conﬁ dence 
with addition and subtraction, the emphasis of in-
struction moves toward learning number combina-
tions. Children who learn addition and subtraction 
conceptually with realistic stories and materials 
have already encountered most or all combinations. 
Learning strategically is more efﬁ cient than memo-
rization alone and has longer term beneﬁ ts for num-
ber sense. Instead of learning 100 addition and 100 
subtraction combinations as isolated facts, children 
learn a strategy, generalization, or rule that yields 
many facts. Learning properties and rules empha-
sizes how numbers work and fosters number sense 
and mental computation.
The 100 basic addition facts are all the combina-
tions of single-digit addends from 0  0  0 to 9  9 
 18, although some teachers or state standards ex-
tend number combinations up to 12  12  24. The 
subtraction facts are the inverse of the 100 addition 
facts. The basic facts are shown on the addition-sub-
traction table in Figure 11.8. As students learn a new 
rule or generalization, they can ﬁ ll in the 10  10 ad-
dition and subtraction fact table (Figure 11.7, Black-
Line Master 11.1). The fact table becomes a record 
of the strategies students are learning. Some facts 
are learned with several strategies so that students 
choose the best strategy for their own learning.
The commutative law for addition means that 
the order of the addends does not change the sum: 
3  6 and 6  3 have the same sum. Because each 
fact is paired with its reverse, students who under-
stand the commutative law can use knowledge of 
one fact to learn its partner. The strategy is illustrated 
by rotating a Uniﬁ x cube train or a domino. “Turn-
around facts” or “ﬂ ip-
ﬂ op facts” are other 
names for the commu-
tative facts in addition. 
Figure 11.8 shows the 
symmetrical 
relation 
of commutative facts. 
Students should also 
understand 
that 
the 
commutative law does 
not apply to subtraction 
because 9  6 does not 
equal 6  9.
The identity element 
of zero for addition is 
demonstrated by put-
ting three cubes in one 
hand and leaving the 
other hand empty. Put-
ting the hands together 
shows 
that 
adding 
“three plus no more” is 
three. After several ex-
amples, ask students to 
develop a rule for add-
ing zero. They will say 
“adding zero doesn’t 
change the answer” or 
similar phrasing. The 
“plus 0” rule accounts 
for 19 facts on the addi-
tion table (Figure 11.9).
Counting-on is a 
particularly 
effective 
strategy 
for 
adding 
one or two, and some 
students may even use 
counting-on for adding

Commutative and Associative Properties (Representation)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups or whole class
Objective: Students demonstrate the commutative and associative 
properties of addition.
Materials: Beans and paper plates, Cuisenaire rods, a sheet of 
number lines for each child
•  Give each student a paper plate with a line dividing it in 
half. Also give each student 20 beans. Ask students to put 
ﬁ ve beans in one half of the plate, and three in the other 
half. Then have them combine the beans on one side.
•  Ask for the total number of beans. (Answer: 8.) Ask which 
of the students put three beans with ﬁ ve and which put 
ﬁ ve beans with three. Ask if the answer was the same.
•  Say: “Tell me about the two number sentences.”
•  Have students repeat with other numbers of beans.
•  Ask students to generalize what they found out. (Answer: 
The sum is the same, no matter which number is ﬁ rst.) 
You may decide to tell them they have discovered the 
commutative property of addition.
•  Ask how they could show the commutative property with 
Cuisenaire-rod trains and with the number line.

•  The same materials and procedures can be changed 
slightly to demonstrate and develop the associative prop-
erty. Children place three sets of beans on a plate show-
ing thirds. Move the plates around in various sequences, 
and write the number sentences such as 3  4  2 and 
2  4  3. Students can combine any two sets ﬁ rst and 
then add the third addend. Ask which combinations are 
easiest for them to recall.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
three. Model the “plus 1” rule with four cubes in one 
hand and one cube the other. After seeing further 
examples, such as 5  1, 8  1, and 2  1, students 
will generalize that “adding 1 is just counting to the 
next number.” The “plus 2” and “plus 3” rules are ex-
tensions. The “plus 1” strategy yields 17 basic facts, 
and the “plus 2” rule gives 15 more facts (Figure 
11.9). With only three strategies of “plus 0,” “plus 1,” 
and “plus 2,” students have strategies for almost half 
the addition facts.
The associative law is an important strategy be-
cause it encourages students to think ﬂ exibly about 
combinations and to use combinations that they 
already know as building blocks. If students know 
4  2 but have problems with 4  3, they split the fact 
and recombine it as 4  2  1. Activity 11.8 is a les-
son on the commutative and associative properties.
Most children learn the double facts, such as 1 
1  2 and 4  4  8, with ease. Perhaps repetition 
is a musical cue because many children almost sing 
the double combinations. The 10 double facts oc-
cupy a diagonal in the addition table (Figure 11.10).
Near doubles or neighbor facts include com-
binations such as 8  9 and 7  6 that may be trouble-
some for some children. The neighbor strategy builds 
on the doubles strategy. Display six red counters and 
six blue counters, and ask for the total. Place one 
more red counter, and ask how many there are now. 
After similar examples using a double fact plus one, 
many children will notice, “It’s just one more than 
the double fact.” Ask children to show how neighbor 
facts line up beside the 
doubles on the addition 
chart (Figure 11.10). 
Some children do not 
make the connection 
immediately and need 
additional time and ex-
perience with the near 
doubles. Activity 11.9 in-
troduces near doubles.

many experiences with tens in place-value activities. 
The Exchange game from Chapter 10 requires stu-
dents to count 10 as they trade up and down. Work 
with pennies and dimes provides many experiences 
for sums of ten. The tens frame in Figure 11.11 is also 
good for developing the make 10 strategy.
When students begin working with more than two 
addends, the make-ten and ten-plus strategies are 
particularly useful because they look for compatible 
numbers totaling 10.
7  6  3  7  3  6  10  6  16
Rearranging the numbers to make a more difﬁ cult 
problem into an easier one continues the theme of 
thinking about how numbers relate.
Activity 11.10 uses the tens frame (Black-Line 
Master 11.2) to demonstrate a visual strategy for ten-
plus combinations.
“Ten minus 1” is used for fact combinations with 
9 as an addend. With the tens frames shown in Fig-
ure 11.11, ask, “What is the sum of 10 plus 4?” When 
students respond 14, remove one counter from the 
10: “What is the sum of 9 plus 4?” After several exam-
ples, give students examples starting with 9  7 and 
ask them to explain their thinking. The tens frame is 
also useful to show the 10 minus 1 strategy.
Understanding addition and subtraction begins 
conceptually through activities with concrete mate-
rials and examples and continues with the develop-
ment of properties, strategies, and rules for the num-
ber combinations. Knowing the properties and rules

Near Doubles (Reasoning)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students use double number combinations to ﬁ nd a 
near-double strategy.
Materials: Double cards for each child, set of near-double cards 
(double dominoes can be used), worksheet for each child
•  Have each child make a set of double facts cards on 4  6 
index cards.
•  Hold up a near-double card, such as 5  6. Say: “Look at 
your double cards and ﬁ nd one that is almost the same. 
Show me that card.” Some children will hold up 5  5; 
others might hold up 6  6.
•  Ask students how their card is similar to 5  6. (Answer: 
5  5 is 10, so 5  6 will be one more, or 11; or 6  6 is 
12, so 5  6 is one less.)
•  Ask what strategies were used for changing the double 
fact to a new fact. (Answer: The ﬁ rst suggests a “double 
plus 1” combination. The second card suggests a “double 
minus 1” combination.) Either strategy is useful, and stu-
dents should be encouraged to consider them both.
•  Ask students to ﬁ nd another double-fact card and near-
double facts that are related to it.
Assessment
•  On a fact worksheet, ask students to circle double facts in 
blue and near doubles in orange.

“Ten plus” is based on the associative property 
and combines “make 10” with counting-on. For 8 
5 the child thinks how to make 10 starting with 8 and 
renames 5 as 2  3. The problem becomes 8  2 
3, or 10 with 3 extra.

supports students’ thinking while they are learning 
the facts. If they cannot remember a fact, they can 
reconstruct the fact. Strategies develop mental com-
putation and number sense and are a critical step in 
learning the facts.
Strategies for Subtraction
Many subtraction strategies are counterparts of ad-
dition strategies. Counting-down strategies for sub-
traction are shown by walking backward on the 
number line or removing items from a set. Students 
will say, “It is just the number before.” This leads to 
strategies of “minus 1” and “minus 2.” Students can 
also recognize situations in which the difference 
between the sum and the known addend is one 
or two.
•  Juan’s dog had 10 puppies. He found new homes 
for nine of the puppies: 10  9  1.
•  We want to buy a book that costs $7.00, but we 
have only $5.00: 7  5  2.
These stories make good “think-aloud” examples for 
students.
When students understand that subtraction is 
the inverse operation for addition through many 
activities, they ﬁ nd that each pair of addition facts 
also yields a pair of subtraction facts. A “fact family” 
involves the commutative law of addition and the 
inverse relationship between addition and subtrac-
tion to produce four related facts. A triangle ﬂ ash-
card (Figure 11.12) shows how three numbers form 
four number sentences.
ACTIVITY 11.10
 
Making Ten with the Tens Frame
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups or student pairs
Objective: Students use the add-to-ten strategy for ﬁ nding sums 
greater than 10.
Materials: Tens frames on overhead or board, magnetic shapes, 
math boxes
•  Tell a story that has a sum greater than 10, such as “Juan 
had seven dimes and then got six more dimes. How many 
dimes did he have?” Model the problem 7 6  ? on the 
tens frame. Use one color of counter on one frame and a 
different color on the other.
•  Ask: “Does anyone see a way to rearrange the coun-
ters to make the answer easy to see?” Ask a student to 
explain while moving three counters from one tens frame 
to another tens frame. Ask if they could have moved the 
counters the opposite way.
•  Ask: “How much is 10 and 3 more?” Ask whether this is 
an easier way to think about adding the two numbers.
•  Tell several other stories for pairs of students to model 
with the tens frame.
•  Ask students to generalize a rule for the sums they have 
been working with. (Answer: First, make ten. Then see 
how many are still in the other tens frame and add that to 
the ten.)
•  Have children work in pairs with counters and tens frames 
to model several other problems.

Figure 11.12 Triangle ﬂ ash cards

A child covers one number on the ﬂ ash card and 
asks the partner for the number sentence that com-
pletes the relationship of addition or subtraction.
Students describe the identity property of the 
“minus 0” strategy as not taking anything away, so 
that they still have what they had at the beginning.
•  I have six oranges and gave none of them away: 
6  0  6.
Children sometimes generalize incorrectly. For ex-
ample, when the problem involves subtracting a 
number from itself, the zero rule sometimes causes 
difﬁ culties.
•  I have six oranges and gave six away: 6  6  0.
If a child confuses subtraction facts involving 
zero, act out several stories to show different situa-
tions. Ask children to generate a rule for a number 
subtracted from itself as “you don’t have any left.” 
This conclusion has an algebraic generalization of 
n  n  0. Activity 11.11 describes an activity in 
which students imagine the missing number in a 
subtraction situation.
Developing Accuracy and Speed 
with Basic Facts
If students do not develop useful fact strategies, they 
revert to less efﬁ cient methods, such as ﬁ nger count-
ing, marking a number line, knocking on the desk, 
or drawing pictures. Although these behaviors are 
useful in developing the concept, continued reliance 
on them inhibits quick, conﬁ dent responses with 
number facts. Many children move from concrete to 
abstract symbolic representations quickly and give 
up concrete materials; others need them for longer 
periods of time. However, teachers should avoid let-
ting students become dependent on physical strate-
gies. Thinking strategies for number operations are 
an important link between understanding concrete 
meaning and achieving accuracy and ready recall 
of number facts.
Activities that focus on accuracy and speed with 
basic facts occur after children understand con-
cepts and symbols for operations and have devel-
oped strategies for many facts. The goal of practice 
activities is ready recall—knowing the sum or differ-
ence with accuracy and appropriate speed. Without 
ready recall of basic facts, various algorithms, es-
timations, and mental computation with numbers 
larger than 100 become laborious and frustrating.
ACTIVITY 11.11
 
Subtracting with Hide-and-Seek Cards (Reasoning)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Student pairs or small groups
Objective: Students use the hide-and-seek strategy for learning 
subtraction facts.
Materials: Teacher-made hide-and-seek cards for several sub-
traction combinations (picture different objects on cards), math 
boxes
•  Have students work in pairs with math box materials. Ask 
students to place a set of objects on a plate (e.g., 11 ob-
jects). Have one student cover part of the set with paper 
or a paper plate cut in half.
•  Ask: “How many do you see?” and “How many are hid-
ing?” The students identify both numbers and say, for 
example, “Eleven minus ﬁ ve equals six.”
•  Students repeat with other combinations of objects, tak-
ing turns covering objects on the plate.
•  Show students a hide-and-seek card with numerals on 
ﬂ aps folded back. Have students identify the “whole” 
(e.g., 12).
•  Cover both portions by folding ﬂ aps over them. Have stu-
dents identify the total number (12). Uncover one part of 
the picture. Have students identify the amount seen (e.g., 
6) and the number still “hiding” (6). Ask students to say 
and write the number sentence.
•  Have children work with several different cards.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
How much emphasis to place on basic facts is 
a continuing issue in mathematics education. Many 
adults remember speed demands and “timed tests” 
as a negative emotional experience that tainted 
their attitude toward mathematics for the rest of 
their lives. Some children enjoy the challenge of tak-
ing timed tests and seeing their progress on public 
display, whereas others shut down emotionally and 
cognitively. Competition between students and pub-
lic displays that show which students have learned 
their facts may seem benign, but many adults re-
call them as a discouraging advertisement of their 
failures.
Knowing the negative impact of timed tests and 
other drill situations, effective teachers should care-
fully consider methods for encouraging accuracy 
and speed with basic facts. The following guidelines 
suggest how practice might be handled in a more 
positive manner.
•  Develop accuracy with facts before speed. Speed 
is the secondary goal.
•  Expectations for speed will be different for each 
child. The time required to master the facts 
differs from student to student. Students should 
not be compared to each other, but they can be 
encouraged to monitor their own progress and 
improvement.
•  Help children develop strategies that make sense 
to them. Begin with the easy strategies and facts 
such as the “plus 1” and “minus 1” rules and then 
move to more complex strategies and facts, such 
as fact families or combinations for 10.
•  Review already learned facts, and gradually add 
new ones. Have students record their mastery 
of the strategies and facts in a personal log or 
table.
•  Keep practice sessions short, perhaps ﬁ ve 
minutes.
•  Use a variety of practice materials, including 
games, ﬂ ash cards, and computer software. Flash 
cards encourage mental computation, whereas 
written practice pages may slow down thinking 
due to focus on writing.
•  Avoid the pressure of group timed tests. Instead 
allow children to test themselves individually 
with a kitchen timer and keep their own record 
of facts learned rather than facts missed. When 
children set their own reasonable time limits, they 
are more motivated to see learning the facts as a 
personal accomplishment.
The goal is for all children to have ready recall 
of facts so that they can move forward in their com-
putational ﬂ uency. Many computer programs offer 
individual practice routines set for individual speed 
and different challenges as well as report scores and 
progress over sessions for the student and teacher. 
Card games such as bingo, memory, and matching 
provide variety in practice.

When students make ﬂ ash cards for the facts as 
they learn them, they can practice alone or with a 
partner.
•  If you can say the answer before you ﬂ ip the ﬂ ash 
card over, put the card in your fast stack. If there 
is a delay, put that card in a second stack to work 
on later.
This activity is also used as an assessment tech-
nique in Activity 11.12. Children identify the facts 
they know and the ones they are working on. The 
personal set of ﬂ ash cards can be taken home to 
practice with siblings or adults.
Self-assessment puts students in charge of their 
learning. They may keep personal improvement 
charts that show how many facts they answered cor-
rectly in 5 minutes, then 4 minutes, and 3 minutes. 
They can mark the combinations they know on an 
addition table or write entries in their journals: “I am 
very fast with the 9s. I know 9  6 is 15 because it is 
1 less than 10  6.”
Effective teachers also watch for signs of frustra-
tion or confusion. If students know only a few facts, 
they are frustrated by practice and avoid it. If stu-
dents revert to ﬁ nger counting, tally marks, or con-

crete strategies, they may be indicating weakness in 
understanding or strategies. In both cases students 
need work with concepts and strategies before 
working on accuracy and speed. Even when stu-
dents have become proﬁ cient with facts, they need 
to refresh their knowledge of strategies and recall of 
facts. At the beginning of the school year a teacher 
might ask students to assess their understanding of 
strategies and recall of facts. Activities for review and 
maintenance should be based on student strengths 
and needs. Activity 11.13 uses a calculator to provide 
practice with basic facts. A beneﬁ t of this activity is 
that it points out the advantage of knowing the facts: 
the brain usually wins over the button.
ACTIVITY 11.12
 
Assessing with Flash Cards
Level: Grades 2– 5
Setting: Individuals
Objective: Student accuracy and speed with subtraction facts is 
assessed, and self-assessment is encouraged.
Materials: Commercial ﬂ ash cards or child-made ﬂ ash cards made 
with index cards. Put the number combination on the front with 
the answer on the back so that when the ﬂ ash card is ﬂ ipped, the 
answer is right side up.
•  As students learn a strategy, have them make their own set 
of ﬂ ash cards or choose the ﬂ ash cards for that strategy.
•  Let students work through the ﬂ ash cards with partners.
•  After practice, do a quick assessment with the ﬂ ash cards 
that the students have. Have students place the cards in 
three stacks: I know the answer fast; I know the answer 
but have to think about it; I don’t know the answer yet.
•  Have the students mark cards green for the ﬁ rst stack, 
yellow for the second, and red for the third.
•  Note on a checklist or addition table which addition facts 
are in each stack.
•  Add new cards as new strategies are learned, and check 
for progress.

Practice Addition and Subtraction Number Facts with Calculators
Level: Grades 1– 4
Setting: Pairs
Objective: Students build accuracy with number facts, and they 
compare the speed of a calculator with thinking.
Materials: Set of student- or teacher-made fact cards, calculator
Use this activity with children who are reasonably proﬁ -
cient with basic facts for addition and subtraction.
•  Students work in pairs with two identical sets of 15 fact 
cards. One student is the Brain, and the other is the But-
ton. The Brain recalls the answers for the fact combina-
tions and writes them on a piece of paper.
•  The Button must key each combination into a calculator, 
then write the answers. As the activity begins, ask: “Who 
will complete the work ﬁ rst, the Brain or the Button?”
•  Start each pair of students simultaneously. An easy way 
to time the activity is to record elapsed time in seconds on 
the chalkboard or overhead projector: 8, 10, 12, 14, . . . . 
Each student notes the time it took her or him to ﬁ nish 
the task. Discuss the results to help students see how 
knowing the facts speeds their work.
Variations
•  Use subtraction, multiplication, and division facts.
•  Use three or four single-digit addends.

What Students Need to Learn 
About Multiplication and Division
As with addition and subtraction, the goal of in-
struction in multiplication and division of whole 
numbers is computational ﬂ uency—knowing 
when and how to compute accurately when solv-
ing problems. Experiences that children have with 
modeling, drawing, and representing addition and 
subtraction problems in everyday situations provide 
a model for work with multiplication and division. 
Understanding multiplication and division begins in 
kindergarten and the primary grades when children 
skip-count, share cookies at snack times, or make 
patterns with linking cubes. Such activities set the 
stage in second and third grade for directed teach-
ing/thinking lessons about multiplication and divi-
sion situations, actions, and strategies for learning 
number combinations.
The NCTM curriculum standards referring to 
whole-number operations emphasize that they 
should be taught in meaningful ways. Table 11.2 out-
lines an instructional sequence for multiplication 
and division that addresses number concepts, con-
nections between operations, and computational 
ﬂ uency with larger numbers. Children who under-
stand how numbers and operations work make con-
nections between whole numbers and fractions, see 
relationships among the four basic operations, and 
grasp topics in number theory such as divisibility.
E X E RC I S E
Compare your state mathematics curriculum with 
the NCTM standards for learning multiplication and 
division. Does the state curriculum emphasize learn-
ing the operations by using realistic situations and 
materials and by solving problems? Does your state 
curriculum address how technology is used in learn-
ing multiplication and division? •••
What Teachers Need to Know 
About Multiplication 
and Division
Adults who use multiplication and division in a 
variety of settings in their everyday life may not 
realize the varied situations and meanings for the 
operations.
Multiplication Situations, 
Meanings, and Actions
Multiplication has three distinct meanings in real-
world situations:
1. Repeated addition: The total in any number of 
equal-size sets.
2. Geometric interpretation: The number repre-
sented by a rectangular array or area.
3. Cartesian product: The number of one-to-one 
combinations of objects in two or more sets.

Research for the Classroom
•
Arthur Baroody and his colleagues Meng-Lung Lai and 
Kelly Mix have compiled a review of the literature on the 
development of young children’s number and opera-
tions sense (Baroody et al., 2005). Based on this research, 
Baroody (2006) advocates a number sense approach for 
students who are learning number combinations. He 
proposes helping students to ﬁ nd patterns that connect 
number combinations by starting with the idea that the 
same number can be represented in many forms; 8 can be 
renamed 1  7, 2  6, 5  3, and 4  4. Flexible thinking 
about numbers allows students to compose and decom-
pose them in ways that make learning facts easier: 8  5 
 8  2  3  10  3. Baroody also suggests that com-
mon instructional techniques emphasize counting strate-
gies that may inhibit learning of facts beyond sums of 10. 
Overemphasis on counting may limit investigation of other 
more useful and generative patterns. Students—in particu-
lar, students with learning disabilities—are trapped by inef-
ﬁ cient strategies that limit their understanding of relation-
ships between numbers and their combinations. Students 
should build a variety of strategies that create groups of 
related facts such as fact families. Although practice has a 
role in learning number combinations, it should be based 
on reasoning strategies that become automatic rather than 
on drill of isolated facts.

 
Chapter 11 Developing Number Operations with Whole Numbers

Repeated addition, the most common multi-
plication situation, involves ﬁ nding a total number 
belonging to multiple groups of the same number.

The geometric interpretation is represented as 
a row-and-column arrangement and is also called a 
rectangular array. Area is one example of the geo-
metric meaning of multiplication.
•  Paolo arranged the chairs in four rows with ﬁ ve 
chairs in each row: 4  5  20 chairs.
4 rows of 5 chairs
•  Gina measured the room. It was 9 feet by 10 feet.
9 feet x 10 feet
The third type of multiplication, Cartesian 
cross-product or combinations, shows the total 
number of possibilities made by choosing one op-
tion from each group of choices.
•  Emma hung up ﬁ ve blouses and three pants to 
see all the outﬁ ts she could make. Five blouses 
paired with three pants makes 15 possible outﬁ ts: 
5  3  15.
Combinations of blouses and pants 
•  Kara had two kinds of cake (yellow and choco-
late) and three ﬂ avors of ice cream (vanilla, 
strawberry, and chocolate mint). Two kinds of 
cake paired with three ﬂ avors of ice cream gives 
six possible dessert choices: 2  3  6.
Combinations of cake and ice cream
If Kara offered four types of toppings (chocolate, hot 
fudge, butterscotch, berry), the number of possible 
dessert combinations would be 2  3  4  24. The 
important limitation on this is that only one choice 
can be made in each category.
Numbers multiplied together are called factors. 
The result of multiplication is the product.
Division Situations, Meanings, 
and Actions
Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. 
In multiplication two factors are known and the 
product is unknown. In division the total or prod-
uct is known, but only one factor is known. The 
total or product is called the dividend, and the 
known factor is the divisor. The unknown factor is 
called the quotient. There are two types of division 
situations:
1.  Repeated subtraction, or repeated measurement: 
How many groups of the same size can be sub-
tracted from a total?

 
Chapter 11 Developing Number Operations with Whole Numbers 
211
2. Sharing, or partitioning: The total is equally dis-
tributed among a known number of recipients.
Because division is the inverse operation of mul-
tiplication, a multiplication situation can illustrate 
the difference between the two types of division.
Multiplication
•  Three boys had four pencils each. How many 
pencils did they have?
3 groups of 4  12
When the known factor is the number of pencils 
for each boy, the question is, How many boys can 
get pencils? The pencils are being measured out in 
groups of 4.
Repeated Subtraction
•  John had 12 pencils. He wants to give four pen-
cils to each of his friends. How many friends can 
John give pencils to?
12  4  4 4  0 Subtract 4 three times.
 
12  4  3
When the known factor is the number of boys, the 
question is how many pencils each will get.
Sharing
•  John has 12 pencils and 3 friends. How many pen-
cils can John give to each of his friends?
The pencils are shared one at a time among the 
friends. John gives each friend one pencil, a second, 
a third, and then a fourth pencil before exhausting 
the pencils.
12  3  4
When the known factor is the number belonging 
to each group, the unknown factor is the number 
of groups. This division situation is called repeated 
subtraction, or repeated measurement. Measure-
ment division asks how many groups of a known 
size can be made. Measurement division is called 
repeated subtraction because the number in each 
group is repeatedly subtracted from the total.
•  Marisa baked 24 cookies and wants to serve 5 
cookies to each person at her party. How many 
people can attend, including herself?
Figure 11.13 shows how Marisa measured the cook-
ies into groups of ﬁ ve. Marisa can serve four people 
and has four extra cookies.
24 cookies divided by 5 cookies 
 4 people at the party plus 4 extra cookies
24  5  4, remainder 4
In an earlier example Paolo arranged 20 chairs 
with 5 chairs in each row. How many rows?
20 chairs in rows of 5 chairs  4 rows
When the number of groups is known but the 
size of each group is not known, the division situa-
tion is called partitive, or sharing. The action in-
volves distributing, or sharing, the number as evenly 
as possible into the given number of groups. Parti-
tive division asks how many are in each group.
•  Kathleen dipped 19 strawberries in chocolate. If 
she is ﬁ lling three gift boxes, how many strawber-
ries go in each box?
Kathleen distributes the 19 strawberries one at a 
time into three boxes.
19 strawberries separated into 3 boxes  
6 strawberries in each box with 1 extra strawberry.
19  3  6, remainder 1
If division is done with numbers that can be 
evenly divided, the result is two whole-number fac-
tors. But division does not always work out evenly

in real life. The groups or objects that are not evenly 
divided are called remainders. Depending on the 
situation, remainders can change the interpretation 
of the answer by rounding up or down, making frac-
tions, or ignoring the remainder altogether.
•  If 4 children can go in each car, how many cars 
are needed for 21 children?
•  If you have 26 cookies for seven children, how 
many cookies does each child receive?
•  A farmer has 33 tomatoes and is packing them 4 
to a box. How many packages are needed?
In each of these cases, the remainder has a speciﬁ c 
meaning or multiple possibilities. Helping students

Developing Multiplication 
and Division Concepts
Many experiences with counting, joining, and sepa-
rating objects and groups of objects in preschool 
and ﬁ rst grade should prepare students for multi-
plication and division. During the second and third 
grade children’s earlier informal experiences enable 
them to invent and understand multiplication and 
division from realistic problems. Just as for addition 
and subtraction, multiplication and division follow 
an instructional sequence that moves from concrete 
to picture to symbol to mental representations and 
from simple to complex problems that stimulate 
children’s thinking. As children learn how multipli-
cation and division work, they uncover basic num-
ber combinations, properties, and strategies.
Introducing Multiplication
Repeated-addition multiplication extends children’s 
experiences with counting and addition. Through 
skip-counting by 2’s, 3’s, 5’s, and 10’s and working 
with groups of buttons, small plastic objects, or 
similar materials, children have established a fun-
damental idea for multiplication—adding equal-
E
size groups. Addends for addition can be any value, 
but in multiplication all the addends must have the 
same value. Teachers help students ﬁ nd and chart 
common objects found in equal-size groups.
•  Groups of 2: Eyes, ears, hands, legs, bicycle 
wheels, headlights.
•  Groups of 3: Triplets, tripod legs, tricycle wheels, 
juice boxes.
•  Groups of 4: Chair legs, car tires, quadruplets.
•  Groups of 5: Fingers, nickels, pentagon sides.
•  Groups of 6: Soft drinks, raisin boxes, hexagon 
sides, insect legs,
•  Groups of 7: Days of the weeks, septagon sides, 
spokes on wheels.
•  Groups of 8: Octopus legs, octagon sides, spider 
legs.
•  Groups of 9: Baseball teams, cats’ lives.
•  Groups of 10: Fingers, toes, dimes.
•  Groups of 12: Eggs, cookies, soft drinks, dodeca-
gon faces.
•  Groups of 100: Dollars, metersticks, centuries, 
football-ﬁ eld lengths.
Children represent the equal groups with objects, 
pictures (Figure 11.14), and numbers.
Patterns are another way that students represent 
multiplication. Linking-cube trains are arranged 
in patterns of two, three, four, or other numbers of 
cubes. Children counting a three-cube pattern and 
emphasizing the last object in each sequence learn 
to skip-count.
One, two, three, four, ﬁ ve, six, seven, eight, nine, . . .
Three, six, nine, . . .
Children often skip-count by 2’s, 5’s, and 10’s, 
and the multiplication facts for these numbers are 
among the easiest for children to learn. Skip count-
ing by 3, 4, 6, 7, and other numbers helps students 
learn those facts as well. Skip counting with the 
calculator is easy. Many calculators allow students 
to key in 6, press the  key, and press the  key 
repeatedly. The display will show 6, 12, 18, 24, and 
so forth. The MathMaster calculator keeps track of 
the number of groups of 6’s on the left side of the 
display and the total number of cubes on the right 
side (Figure 11.15).

 
Chapter 11 Developing Number Operations with Whole Numbers 
213
Focusing on groups instead of individual items 
helps children move to multiplicative thinking. In-
stead of counting each insect leg, students can think 
of six legs for each insect, and four insects have “6, 
12, 18, 24 legs.” Thinking in multiples is quicker 
for determining the total in equal-size groups than 
counting each item. Activity 11.14 illustrates one way 
to encourage thinking in multiples.
Students write stories, draw pictures, and write 
number sentences to record multiplication situa-
tions. For example, in Figure 11.16 children write 
the addition sentence 7  7  7  21 to represent 
the story. Students notice that both the picture and

Repeated Addition (Representation)
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students describe the relationship between multiplica-
tion and repeated addition.
Materials: Counting cubes
•  Each team of four students is given four different multipli-
cation word problems.
•  Sadie buys gum in packages that have seven sticks each. 
When she buys four packages, how many sticks does 
she get?
•  Conrad has ﬁ ve packages of trading cards. How many 
cards does he have if each package holds ﬁ ve cards?
•  Jawan has three packages of frozen wafﬂ es. How many 
wafﬂ es does he have if each package has eight wafﬂ es 
in it?
•  Jaime has eight boxes of motor oil. Each box contains 
four cans of oil. How many cans of oil does Jaime have?
•  Each team member models one story with objects and 
shares the results with team members.
•  Ask children to explain their solution using different tech-
niques: repeated addition, skip counting, and multiplica-
tive thinking. Write addition sentences and multiplication 
sentences for the problems on the board.
•  Have teams make up problems to send to other teams to 
solve.

the addition sentence show three 7’s. The 3 is the 
number of sets, and 7 is the number in each set. 
The answer, 21, tells the total number of objects in 
3 sets of 7.
 
7  7  7  21
 
3 groups of 7  21
 
3  7  21
This situation can be used to introduce the sym-
bols for multiplication. The multiplication sentence 
for “three groups of seven” is written 3  7  21 be-
neath the addition sentence. Reading the number 
sentence as “three groups of seven equals twenty-
one” emphasizes the multiplier meaning of the 3. 
The ﬁ rst factor is called the multiplication operator
or multiplier because it acts on the second factor, 
the multiplicand, which names the number of ob-
jects in each set. Activity 11.14 shows how coopera-
tive groups explore and share story problems that 
model repeated addition and multiplication.
Because children are already familiar with 
stacked notation for addition, both the multiplica-
tion sentence in horizontal and stacked notation can 
be introduced, with one difference. In the horizontal 
notation the ﬁ rst number is the multiplier; in the ver-
tical notation the multiplier is the bottom number. 
Both forms are read “three groups of seven.” The 
order of factors has meaning when related directly 
to a multiplication story and when algorithms are 
introduced.
The geometric interpretation of multiplication 
shows the graphic arrangement of objects in rows 
and columns called rectangular arrays. Arrays 
are seen in the desk arrangement in some class -
rooms, ceiling and ﬂ oor tiles, cans at the grocery 
store, window panes, shoes boxes on shelves, and 
rows of a marching band. As students identify arrays 
in their world, they can draw pictures for the bul-
letin board and write journal entries to share with 
classmates.
Students also show understanding by arranging 
disks or tiles into arrays. When exploring rectangular 
arrays, students discover that some numbers can be 
arranged in only one array; these numbers are prime 
numbers. Other numbers (composite numbers) can 
be arranged in several ways to show whole-number 
factors, such as 16 tiles: 1 row of 16, 2 rows of 8, or 4 
rows of 4 (Figure 11.17).

Arrays also illustrate the commutative property 
of multiplication, as in Figure 11.18. Library book 
pockets and index cards in Figure 11.19 show arrays 

of bugs with 5 as a factor: One row of 5 bugs (a); 2 
rows of 5 bugs is 10 (b); 3 rows of 5 bugs is 15 (c). 
As each row is revealed, students skip-count. Stu-
dents can make index cards for other multiplication 
combinations.
Area measurement of rectangles is related to 
multiplication arrays. In an informal measurement 
activity, children cover their desktop or book with 
equal-size squares of paper, sticky notes, or tiles. 
They soon discover that they only need to cover 
each edge of the rectangle to compute the total 
number needed to cover the top by multiplying. Col-
oring rectangles on a piece of centimeter grid pa-
per also shows arrays. Two number cubes generate 
the length of the sides. The length of each side and 
the total number of squares create a multiplication 
sentence (Figure 11.20). Area measurement is dis-
cussed further in Chapter 18.
sentations, while the same combinations are shown 
by color cubes. More symbolic representations of 
combinations of shirts and pants are letter-coded 
combinations and a lattice diagram showing 15 
points of intersection.
Additional stories provide exploration of other 
combinations with objects, drawings, diagrams, or 
symbols.

Children can make up their own menus for choices 
in the ice cream shop (1 ﬂ avor from 31, 1 cone from 
4, 1 topping from 6) or other situations that involve 
making choices from a set of options such as pizza 
(crust, toppings) or automobiles (color, engine, inte-
rior). A cooperative learning activity in Activity 11.15 
involves creating color combinations for custom-
ordered bicycles.

Introducing Division
Division is the inverse operation for multiplica -
tion. Multiplication is used for situations when the 
factors are known to calculate a product. For divi-
sion the product, or total, is known but only one 
factor is known. Children need experience with 
two division situations—measurement and parti-
tive—illustrated by realistic stories and modeled 
with manipulatives.
• Multiplication: I am making breakfast for four 
people. If I cook each of them two eggs, how 
many eggs do I need?
• Measurement, or repeated subtraction, division: I 
have eight eggs. How many people can be served 
if I cook two eggs for each person?

Color Combinations for Bicycles (Representation)
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students model concepts of multiplication.
Materials: Pieces of red, silver, gold, and black paper; six different 
colors of yarn; clear tape
•  Present this situation: Each team of four is a work crew in 
a bicycle manufacturing plant. The company’s designer 
has decided that the plant will produce bicycle frames 
in four colors: red, silver, gold, and black. Each bicycle 
will have one color of trim painted on it, chosen from six 
possibilities. The task will be to create color samples for 
the bicycles before making them. How many different 
bicycles can be made from four frame colors and six trim 
paints?
•  Assign a role to each team member. One student is the 
manager; the manager reads the directions and keeps 
the team on track. The second student is the layout 
worker; the layout worker organizes the bicycles (colored 
papers) by color. The third student is the trim worker; the 
trim worker distributes the trim colors (yarn). The fourth 
member of each team is the trim painter; the trim painter 
applies the trim (tapes the yarn to the paper).
•  Each team has 15 minutes to complete the samples. 
Before teams begin work, team members plan how to 
organize different combinations of colors.
•  After 15 minutes, ask the teams to report and show their 
color samples and the number of combinations. Ask stu-
dents whether all the combinations are likely to be equally 
popular.
•  Ask the teams to determine the number of combinations 
for ﬁ ve frame colors and three trim paints and for four 
frame colors and ﬁ ve trim paints. During discussion of the 
new situations, ask students if there is a way to know 
the number of different combinations without making 
the samples. What is the advantage of making all the 
samples?

 
Chapter 11 Developing Number Operations with Whole Numbers 
217
In measurement division the total (8 eggs) and the 
size of each group (2 eggs) are known. The number 
of groups (people) is unknown. Children act out the 
problem by placing two plastic eggs each on one 
plate, two plates, three plates, and four plates until 
all the eggs are gone. Repeated subtraction, another 
name for measurement, is modeled by students re-
moving two eggs, then two more, then another two, 
and ﬁ nally two more.
• Partitive, or sharing, division: I have eight eggs to 
divide equally among four people. How many 
eggs can I cook for each person?
In a partitive division story the total number of eggs 
(8) and the number of people (4) are known, but the 
number of eggs for each person is unknown. Chil-
dren share eggs by putting one egg on each person’s 
plate, then another for each person, until all the eggs 
are gone (Figure 11.22). Sharing is another name for 
partitive division.
Measurement division: 8 eggs are distributed 2 each 
to 4 plates.
Partitive division: 8 eggs are distributed one at a 
time to 4 plates.
Measurement stories are preferred by many 
teachers because subtraction is a well-known model 
for children. As soon as students see how division 
is working, teachers can introduce situations with 
remainders.
•  Natasha bought a package of 14 pencils. If she 
gave four pencils to each friend, how many 
friends would get four pencils? Four pencils are 
put into three cups with two extra pencils.

From their actions students see that 14 is the orig-
inal group of pencils, 4 indicates the size of each 
group of pencils being subtracted, and 3 represents 
the number of groups. Two pencils are not in a cup 
because they are not a complete group of 4. The 
teacher asks students what they might do with the 
two extra pencils.
Division stories of both types are acted out with 
materials and represented with pictures; the teacher 
introduces the division sentence and symbols. As 
children see repeated subtraction, they write three 
subtraction sentences. After 4 is subtracted three 
times, 2 pencils are left undivided. The horizontal 
division sentence is introduced to show the same 
information. The division sentence is read “Four-
teen divided by three equals four with a remainder 
of two.”
Students act out familiar situations of sharing 
items such as cookies to illustrate partitive division. 
If they begin with 17 cookies, they can share the 
cookies with three people, four people, ﬁ ve people, 
or six people. After students have acted out several 
sharing situations and represented the actions in 
pictures or diagrams, record their work with a divi-
sion sentence:
17  5  3, remainder 2.
The Doorbell Rang, by Pat Hutchins (New York: 
Harper Collins, 1986), is a picture book that models 
sharing (Activity 11.16). Each time the doorbell rings,

more guests come to the party, and the cookies are 
shared to accommodate all the guests.
When division is introduced with materials, most 
children recognize that division and multiplication 
are inverse operations. Multiplication joins sets, just 
as addition does; division separates, just as subtrac-
tion does. Children also learn mathematical vocab-
ulary associated with division. The number being 
divided is the dividend, the number by which it is 
divided is the known factor or divisor, and the an-
swer is the unknown factor or quotient.
The meaning of the dividend never changes; it 
always tells the size of the original group. But the 
roles of divisor (the known factor) and quotient (the 
unknown factor) are interchanged, depending on 
the situation. In measurement the divisor tells the 
size of each group, and the quotient tells the number 
of groups. In a partitive situation the divisor tells the 
number of groups, and the quotient tells the size of 
each group. Children also recognize that a dividend 
in division is related to a product in multiplication. 
As children develop number sense about division, 
they think about the meaning of the remainder in 
context rather than by rule.

Working with Remainders
Introducing remainders early through division sto-
ries allows students to see remainders as a natural 
event. They ﬁ nd that some situations involve num-
bers that divide without a remainder and that some 
do not. When remainders are included in examples, 
children discuss the meaning of remainders in dif-
ferent situations and develop options for working 
with them.
•  The basket had 25 apples in it. If 25 apples are 
shared equally by three children, how many 
apples will each have?
25  3  8 remainder 1
Children may suggest, “Eat 1 apple yourself and don’t 
tell,” “Cut it up so that everybody gets some,” “Put it 
back in the box,” “Give it to grandmother,” and so 
forth. Sometimes the remainder can be divided into 
equal parts; other times the remainder is ignored or 
might call for an adjustment of the ﬁ nal answer up 
to the next whole number. Talking about remainders 
helps students understand that the remainder needs 
to be considered in the calculated answer and its 
meaning.
Various examples illustrate the different mean-
ings for the remainder.

•  Have students discuss what happens as the number of 
people increases.
•  Tell each team to create a story about sharing things and 
prepare to act it out (allow approximately 5 minutes).
•  Each team acts out its story while other teams observe. 
After each story, discuss what was demonstrated by the 
actors.
•  End the lesson by giving each group a small bag of cook-
ies or other treats, which they must share equally among 
themselves.

•  We have 32 children in our class. If we play a 
game that requires three equal-size teams, how 
many players will be on each team?
The computed answer is 10 children on each team 
with 2 children left over. A calculator answer is 10.67 
or 102
3. However, cutting children into parts is not 
reasonable. Students may decide that the practical 
solution requires two teams of 11 and one team of 
10. They might decide that three equal teams of 10 is 
better and assign two students tasks such as keeping 
score, managing equipment, or refereeing. Students 
can recognize the difference between a computed 
answer and a practical answer.
•  Sixty-eight apples are to be put into boxes. If each 
box holds eight apples, how many boxes are 
needed?
The paper-and-pencil an-
swer is 8, remainder 4, 
and a calculator answer 
will be 8.5. The physical 
answer to the question is 
eight full boxes and an-
other half-box. The practi-
cal answer could be eight 
if the remainder is disre-
garded or nine if all the 
apples need to be placed 
in boxes even if they are 
not full. The remainder 
might be ignored if only 
the number of full boxes 
is considered, or students 
may suggest that they 
need nine boxes, even 
though one box is not 
completely full.
•  Three cans of cat food cost $0.98. How much will 
one can cost?
When $0.98 is divided by 3, the answer is $0.3266667. 
However, students should understand that the price 
will be rounded up to $0.33 when only one can is 
bought.
•  Our grade has 52 children who will ride to camp 
in minivans. If each van can carry six children 
and their gear, how many vans will be needed?
The computed answer for 52  6 is 8, remainder 
4, or 8.6667. Acting out or modeling this situation 
shows that four children are without transportation 
after eight vans have been ﬁ lled. One more van will 
be needed for the four remaining children. A total 
of nine vans is needed, so the number is raised to 
the next whole number. More discussion about the 
fractional treatment of remainders is included in 
Chapter 14.
What Teachers Need to 
Know About Properties of 
Multiplication and Division
An identity element is a number that does not change 
the value of another number during an arithmetic 
operation. Multiplying by 1 does not change the 
value of a number, so 1 is the identity element for 
multiplication. For example, consider 12  1  12. 
The identity element for division is also 1. Consider 
12  1  12.
The commutative property of multiplication, 
similar to the commutative property of addition, is 
illustrated when the order of factors is switched but 
the product is the same.
•  A fruit stand has gift boxes of four apples. How 
many apples are in six boxes?
(a) 6 boxes of 4 apples
•  A fruit stand has gift boxes of six apples. How 
many apples are in four boxes?
(b) 4 boxes of 6 apples
Division is not commutative, as students should rec-
ognize when they consider 35  5 and 5  35.
The associative property for multiplication 
is similar to the associative property for addition. 
When three or more factors are multiplied, the order 
MISCONCEPTION
Many tests, such as the 
National Assessment of 
Educational Progress 
(NAEP), report that 
proper interpretation of 
remainders in division 
problems causes errors 
by many students even 
through middle and high 
school. Even if students 
can compute an answer 
correctly, they do not con-
sider how the remainder 
is used in a problem con-
text. Introducing remain-
ders in stories and asking 
students to consider 
how remainders should 
be treated establishes a 
foundation for reasoning 
about their meanings.

in which they are paired for computation does not 
affect the product.
•  Robin was taking inventory at the grocery store. 
The cans of green beans were stacked three cans 
across, two cans high, and six cans back.
The associative property allows factors 3  2  6 to 
be grouped for multiplication in several ways:
 
(3  2)  6  6  6
 
2  (3  6)  2  18
 
3  (2  6)  3  12
 
 (6  2)  3  12  3
(n1  n2)  n3  n1  (n2  n3)
The associative property, like the commutative prop-
erty, applies to multiplication but not to division.
The distributive property of multiplication 
and division over addition allows a number to be 
separated into addends and multiplication or divi-
sion to be applied or distributed to each addend.
•  The stools cost $27 each. Ms. Turner wanted to 
buy four of them.
In the case of 4  $27, the multiplier 4 can be ap-
plied to 20  7, to 25  2, or to 15  12:
4  (20  7)  (4  20)  (4  7)  80  28  108
4  (25  2)  (4  25)  (4  2)  100  8  108
4  (15  12)  (4  15)  (4  12)  60  48  108
The distributive property of division over addition 
also means that the dividend can be broken into 
parts that are easier to calculate. For example, when 
39 is divided by 3, 39 can be thought of as 30  9 or 
as 24  15 and division can be performed on each 
addend:
39  3  (30  9)  3, or (30  3)  (9  3)  10  3  13
39  3  (24  15)  3, or (24  3)  (15  3)  8  5  13
Learning Multiplication and 
Division Facts with Strategies
As students work with equal-size groups, arrays, 
area models, and Cartesian product situations, they 
become familiar with the multiplication of number 
combinations. Learning 2  5  10 is not difﬁ cult 
for children who understand two groups of ﬁ ve and 
have experience skip counting 5, 10, 15, . . . . Un-
derstanding the inverse relationship between mul-
tiplication and division connects the multiplication 
facts to division facts. In fact, when students are act-
ing out division problems, they often discover this 
connection.
Learning number facts through strategies means 
that students are going beyond memorization; they 
understand the fundamental rules and properties 
for multiplication and division that support men-
tal calculations and number sense. Some multipli-
cation and division strategies are similar to strate-
gies for addition and subtraction facts, so children 
should be familiar with them. Because many facts 
can be learned with a variety of strategies, children 
can adopt the strategy that works best for them. The 
multiplication chart is a good way to organize facts 
as students learn strategies.
Skip counting is the ﬁ rst valuable strategy be-
cause the “verbal chain” of multiples (2, 4, 6, 8, . . . 
and 5, 10, 15, 20, . . .) is a familiar sequence. Most chil-
dren learn the facts for 2, 5, and 10 easily. Learning 
skip counting for other facts by counting multiples 
on the hundreds chart supports the meaning of mul-
tiplication. On the multiplication chart (Black-Line 
Master 11.3) students can ﬁ ll in the multiplication 
facts for 2’s and 5’s.
The commutative law for multiplication states that 
the order of the factors does not change the prod-
ucts so that each multiplication fact has a mirror 
fact: 6  4  4  6. Activities with arrays illustrate 
the commutative law graphically. When children 
recognize that the commutative law gives them 
pairs of equivalent facts, they can use this strategy 
for learning facts.

Multiplying with 0 is modeled with no cubes in 
one cup, no cubes in two cups, up to no cubes in 
nine cups. “How many are in one group of zero? 
two groups of zero? nine groups of zero? a million 
groups of zero?” The question can also be asked, 
“How many are in zero groups of ﬁ ve? no groups of 
220

Chapter 11 Developing Number Operations with Whole Numbers 
221
17? zero groups of a thousand?” Students develop 
the rule that “multiplying with zero gives you zero” 
or similar phrasing.
Multiplication with 1 introduces the identity ele-
ment for multiplication. It is also easy to model with 
language similar to that used for multiplication by 
zero. Put one cube in several cups. “How many is 
two groups of one? six groups of one? ninety-nine 
groups of one?” The commutative situation is also 
presented. “How many are in one group of six? one 
group of 50? one group of a million?” Reasoning from 
the model leads most children to the realization that 
“multiplying by 1 doesn’t change the number.”
Multiplication by 2 connects skip counting 2’s and 
relates to double facts in addition. Because 3  3 is 
6, two groups of three are six. This pattern is easy to 
illustrate with linking cubes, and children recognize 
that “a number multiplied by 2 is the same as adding 
a number twice.”
The squared facts are those facts found when 
a number is multiplied by itself, such as 4  4 or 7 
 7. The geometric interpretation makes a strong vi-
sual impression that the square facts are also square 
arrays. The near squares, or square neighbors, 
occupy the spaces on either side of the square facts 
and can be thought of as one multiple more or one 
multiple less than the square fact. If 8  8 is 64, then 
7  8 is 64  8  56 and 9  8 is 64  8  72. Skip 
counting by 8’s provides good background for this 
mental computation.
Multiplying with 9 as a factor can be developed 
with several strategies. One strategy involves multi-
plying by 10’s—which students have already learned 
using skip counting. If 10  9 is 90, then 9  9 is 90 
minus 9. If 10  5 is known to be 50, then 9  5 is 50 
minus 5. Other interesting patterns are explored in 
Activity 11.17.
The distributive law of multiplication provides 
another strategy for learning multiplication facts 
by breaking an unknown product into two known 
products. If the answer to 7  6 is unknown, the 
problem can be distributed as (7  3)  (7  3) 
or 21  21 (Figure 11.23). This strategy will become 
important as children work with algorithms in inter-
mediate grades.
Division Facts Strategies
When students understand that division and mul-
tiplication are inverse operations, students use the 
multiplication facts to learn division facts through 
activities that focus on a product and its factors. A 
factor tree introduces students to a missing factor. 
By drawing a factor tree, they can see that the fac-
tors for 24 could be 6  4, 8  3, 12  2, or 24  1. 
While looking at the various trees, the teacher can 
ask, “If 24 is a product and 4 is a factor, what is the 
missing factor?”

Other properties and rules are also useful in 
learning division facts.
Zero in division can be used in two ways. When 
the total being divided is zero, the quotient is also 
zero. Children enjoy the absurd notion of dividing 
zero objects into groups.
•  I had no oranges in my basket. I divided them 
among seven friends. How many oranges did 
each get? Each friend gets 0 oranges.
However, zero is never used as a divisor. Stories il-
lustrate the logical absurdity of dividing by zero.

•  Ask students to look for patterns and relationships 
between the two lists of facts. They may suggest several 
different patterns in the facts:
•  The digits in each of the 9 facts all add up to 9.
•  A product can be matched with another product that 
has the same numbers but reversed, such as 81 and 18.
•  You can count to get the facts for 9. Write 9, 8, 7, and 
so forth in the ones place; then start at the bottom and 
write 9, 8, 7, and so forth in the tens place.
•  The 9 facts are less than the 10 facts.
•  The difference between the 10 facts and the 9 facts is 
the number of rods. Some students may express the dif-
ference with a number sentence: n  9  (n  10)  n.
•  Ask students which patterns help them remember the 
facts for 9. Their answers will vary depending on the pat-
tern that they notice and use.
Extension
The facts for 9 can also be shown with ten ﬁ ngers. Tell 
students that you will show them how to multiply by 9 
using their ﬁ nger calculator. Ask them to hold both hands 
up so that they can see their palms. Model this action. 
For the math fact 4  9, ask students to bend down the 
fourth ﬁ nger. Tell them the three ﬁ ngers to the left of the 
bent ﬁ nger are worth ten each and the six ﬁ ngers to the 
right of the bent ﬁ nger are worth one each. Ask students 
the math fact for 36. When you bend the fourth ﬁ nger 
down say, “4  9 is 36.” Ask students to see if the ﬁ nger 
calculator works for all the 9 facts starting with the ﬁ rst 
ﬁ nger. After students are able to multiply with their ﬁ n-
ger calculator, ask them why the ﬁ nger calculator works 
for 9’s but not for other facts.

Bend down 4th finger from the left (represents the “4” in 
the equation)

Although the basic multiplication facts go through 9  9, 
including the facts through 10  10 is common because 
the 10’s are easy and important for later computa-
tion. Many teachers also encourage students to learn 
number combinations for multiples of 11 and 12. The 
combinations for 11 are easy using the 11’s pattern and 
skip counting: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, and so on. When 
students learn the multiplication facts for 12, they should 
notice the relationship between the 12 facts and facts 
already learned for 6.

In Activity 11.18 children ﬁ ll in the multiplication 
table to show 19 facts with 0 as a factor, 17 identity 
facts (1 as a factor), and 15 double facts (2 as a fac-
tor). These three strategies supply 51 quick and easy 
multiplication facts. When the facts for 5 are also 
placed on the table, only 36 facts remain. Various 
strategies might be used to simplify these 36 facts, 
such as pairing facts using the commutative law 
(e.g., 7  9 and 9  7). The associative law is also 
useful for facts involving 6, 7, and 8 when students 
know easier facts. The squared facts, such as 3  3

•  Point out the factors across the top and down the left 
side; products will be at the intersection of two factors.
•  Begin with 0 on the left side as a factor: “If we multiply 
each number in the top row by 0, what are the prod-
ucts?” (Answer: They are all 0.) Fill in the cells after each 
question: “Where else will there be products that are 0?” 
(Answer: Down the ﬁ rst column of cells.) “How many 
multiplication facts have 0 as a factor?” (Answer: 19.)
•  Use 1 as a factor and ask: “What is the product when 
we multiply each number in the top row by 1?” (Answer: 
Each product is the same as the number in the top row.) 
“Where else do we ﬁ nd factors that work this way?” 
(Answer: When numbers in the left-hand column are 
multiplied by 1 in the top row.) Ask how many facts are 
found with the identity element of 1. (Answer: 17 more 
facts—those that have 1 as a factor, excluding those that 
have 0.) Add 19 and 17 to show that by knowing the role 
of 0 and 1 in multiplication, students know more than 
one-third of the basic facts.
•  The third row and third column of cells have 2 as a factor. 
Ask students about skip counting by 2’s, or doubles. Write 
the 15 products for these combinations in the table. Point 
out that the easy combinations with 0, 1, and 2 contain 
more than half the basic facts.
•  Combinations with 5 as one factor offer little difﬁ culty to 
most children because of skip counting by 5’s. Add these 
to the table. They contribute another 13 facts.
•  Most students probably already know the remaining com-
binations for cells in the upper left-hand part of the table: 
3  3, 3  4, 4  3, and 4  4.
•  Ask how many facts are not yet written in. Ask which of 
those facts the students already know. Different children 
may already know some of these facts. This process high-
lights the 20 or so facts that usually take extra work, and 
students can concentrate on them in their practice.

and 7  7, are on a diagonal on the multiplication 
chart. Ten square facts and 18 neighbor facts mean 
that almost a quarter of the facts can be learned 
with this strategy.
A table also demonstrates the relationship be-
tween multiplication and division facts. Factors are 
on the left side and top row, with products in the 
center of the table; for every product the two factors 
can be identiﬁ ed by tracing up and to the left. For 48 
 8, ﬁ nd 48 in the table and trace left to the 8 and up 
to the 6 or left to 6 and up to 8.
Building Accuracy and Speed with 
Multiplication and Division Facts
Knowledge of multiplication and division facts is 
expected of elementary school students. When stu-
dents understand the operations and have strategies 
for learning and remembering the number combina-
tions, they are ready to work on ready recall.
Accuracy is the ﬁ rst priority in developing ready 
recall and speed, which varies among children. 
Practice activities for multiplication and division 
follow the same guidelines presented for addition 
and subtraction facts; practice should be short, fre-
quent, and varied in method, with an emphasis on 
personal improvement. Classroom procedures used 
for practicing number combinations can support 
conﬁ dence and motivation, or undermine them.
Many practice activities can be used, including 
computer software, ﬂ ash cards, and partner games. 
Consider triangle ﬂ ash cards (Figure 11.24a). When 
children pair up to play, one child covers the product 
63, the other child multiplies the factors to ﬁ nd the 
product: 7  9  63. For division one child covers 
one factor such as 9, and the partner says, “63  7 
9.” The partner card in Figure 11.24b shows all multi-
plication facts with 8 as a factor on the front and all 
related division facts with 8 as a divisor on the back. 
Students take turns putting a pencil or ﬁ ngertip in a 
notch next to a number, such as 9. One partner says 
“9  8  72” or “8  9  72” and is checked by the 
partner on the opposite side of the card. For division 
the partner on the division side might say “72  8 
9” and be checked.
Many drill games and activities for improving ac-
curacy and speed are available on the Internet and 
in commercial packages. Student improvement has 
been reported as a result of using these materials.

Take-home activities show parents that the cur-
riculum includes more than practicing computa  -
tion with algorithms. The two accompanying 
activities require reasoning to determine cor-
rect solutions. The challenge of each activity will 
intrigue many parents as well as students. They are 
good cooperative-learning activities for adults and 
students at home.
Addition with Number Squares
Work this puzzle with other people in your home.
• Cut out nine 1-inch squares of paper.
•  Put the numeral 1 on one square of paper, the 
numeral 2 on the next, and so forth until each 
square is numbered (1 to 9).
•  Arrange the squares so that you have a large 
square with 3 three-place numbers and so 
that the sum of the numbers made by the 
squares in the top and middle rows equals the 
number made by the squares in the bottom 
row.
Can you arrange the squares in more ways than 
one and get a correct answer each time? Can you 
ﬁ nd a pattern that will help you make arrange-
ments that work? Write your solutions in your jour-
nal as you work so that you can share them with 
classmates and your teacher tomorrow.

Summary
Curriculum standards emphasize student understand-
ing of four arithmetic operations, when and how to use 
the operations to solve problems, and accurate recall 
of basic number facts. Development of number opera-
tions begins while children are counting, classifying, and 
comparing sets of concrete objects. During the concep-
tual development phase of number operations, children 
tell stories, model problems, draw pictures, and write 
number sentences as they construct meanings and ac-
tions for addition, four subtraction situations (takeaway, 
whole-part-part, comparison, completion), three multi-
plication interpretations (repeated addition, geometric 
interpretation, Cartesian product), and two division 
types (measurement, or repeated subtraction, division; 
partitive, or sharing, division). During this time, students 
explore all the number combinations and properties of 
the operations.
As students understand each operation, they ﬁ nd 
strategies and properties to organize the number com-
binations. Strategies based on arithmetic properties 
and rules about how numbers work make learning facts 
more meaningful and easier. Instead of memorizing, 
students learn how numbers work as a foundation for 
number sense and estimation. Finally, students need 
time to develop ready recall of number combinations. 
Practice with number combinations might include ﬂ ash 
cards, partner games, computer games, and worksheets. 
Because individual children differ in their progress with 
number facts, personal improvement and success are 
crucial elements to a successful practice program. Over-
emphasis on speed, such as timed tests, is cited as a ma-
jor cause of mathematics anxiety.
When students understand each of the operations, 
have learned meaningful strategies for learning number 
combinations, and have developed ready recall of facts, 
they have foundational skills for computational ﬂ uency. 
They will extend these skills as they add, subtract, mul-
tiply, and divide larger numbers with a variety of algo-
rithms, through technology, and with number sense 
such as estimation and checking for reasonableness.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Tell stories that illustrate addition and each of the 
four types of subtraction. Model each story with 
counters, draw a picture of the story, and write a 
number sentence for it. Which of the stories were 
easiest for you? Were any more difﬁ cult?
 2.  Using counters or interlocking cubes, model the 
commutative property, the associative property, and 
the identity element for addition. Can you think of 
real-life situations that illustrate ideas similar to com-
mutativity, associativity, or identity?
 3.  Write a subtraction question and draw a simple pic-
ture or diagram for each of the following situations. 
Label each situation with the type of subtraction it 
illustrates.
  a.  Mr. Ramirez had 16 boys in a class of 25 children.
  b.  Joan weighed 34 kilograms, and Yusef weighed 
41 kilograms.
  c.  Mrs. Bennett bought two dozen oranges and 
served 14 of them to girls after soccer practice.
  d.  Mr. Hoang had 18 mathematics books for 27 
students.
  e.  Diego had 34 cents. The whistle costs 93 cents.
 4.  Write stories to illustrate the three multiplication in-
terpretations. Draw pictures and diagrams for each. 
Are there any similarities in your diagrams for the 
three interpretations?
 5.  Identify each of the following situations as measure-
ment or partitive. Write the question that goes with 
the situation, and draw a picture for one problem of 
each type of division. Then write a number sentence 
for the picture. What would you do with the remain-
der, if any, in each of these cases?
  a.  Geraldo shared 38 stickers with six friends so 
that each got the same number of stickers.
  b.  Juan had 25 chairs. He put six of them in each 
row.
  c.  Mr. Hui imported 453 ornaments. He packaged 
24 ornaments in each box to ship to retailers.
  d.  Ms. Krohn divided $900 evenly among her four 
children.
 6.  Do you remember learning about remainders? Do 
you agree or disagree with the idea to introduce 
remainders early in learning about division? Why?
 7.  Look at an elementary school textbook, and see 
how addition and subtraction are introduced. Do 
the teaching/learning activities in the teacher’s 
manual use stories, pictures, and manipulatives to 
model the operations? Does the textbook emphasize 
the development of strategies for learning number 
facts?
 8.  Obtain a practice page of 100 addition or subtrac-
tion facts, and take a 3-minute timed test. How many 
did you complete? How many of the completed an-
swers were correct? How did you feel at the end of 
the test? Discuss with fellow students their memories 
of timed tests. What are the possible harmful as-
pects of this practice? What ways can you think of to 
overcome the pressure and anxiety many students 
feel from such tests?

Extending 
Computational 
Fluency with 
Larger Numbers
n the primary grades students begin work with number 
and number operations encountered in the context of 
realistic situations and problems. They learn to count 
objects and sets; they represent numerical situations 
with materials, pictures, and numerals; and they establish 
basic understandings of place value and properties of number 
operations. These concepts and skills are the foundation for computational 
ﬂ uency, and their use continues through intermediate and middle grades. 
Computational ﬂ uency refers to the use of numbers with conﬁ dence and 
ease in problem-solving situations. Students with computational ﬂ uency 
know when and how to calculate to solve problems with the four basic op-
erations. Fluency is more than memorizing computational rules or learning 
key words; it includes estimation, number sense, and incorporating higher-
order thinking skills, such as judgments about the reasonableness of com-
puted answers. In this chapter activities and examples extend basic concepts 
and skills with number operations by introducing written algorithms, includ-
ing alternative approaches for all four operations, estimation, mental compu-
tation, and use of technology.

Number Operations 
with Larger Numbers
In primary grades students begin their work with 
numbers up to 100 or 200 that allow them to explore 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in 
problem situations. They learn properties of num-
ber operations and strategies for number facts to 
develop accuracy and speed. In intermediate and 
middle grades students extend their understanding 
of operations, strategies, and facts when working 
with two-digit and three-digit numbers. Operations 
with smaller numbers can be modeled with base-10 
blocks and represented in pictures, and these mod-
els are useful for understanding that the same prop-
erties of operations also apply to larger numbers. 
Solving problems through concrete, pictorial, and 
symbolic representations builds the foundation for 
computational ﬂ uency with larger numbers, which 
are more difﬁ cult to represent physically.
The NCTM standards on extending number and 
number operations are the following (National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000):
NCTM Standards on Extending 
Number and Operations
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 
12 should enable all students to:
•  Understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, re-
lationships among numbers, and number systems;
•  Understand meanings of operations and how they relate 
to one another;
•  Compute ﬂ uently and make reasonable estimates.
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  Develop a sense of whole numbers and represent and use 
them in ﬂ exible ways, including relating, composing, and 
decomposing numbers;
•  Connect number words and numerals to the quanti-
ties they represent, using various physical models and 
representations;
•  Understand various meanings of addition and subtraction 
of whole numbers and the relationship between the two 
operations;

ing objects, mental computation, estimation, paper and 
pencil, and calculators.
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  Understand the place-value structure of the base-10 
number system and be able to represent and compare 
whole numbers and decimals;
•  Recognize equivalent representations for the same num-
ber and generate them by decomposing and composing 
numbers;
•  Explore numbers less than 0 by extending the number line 
and through familiar applications;
•  Describe classes of numbers according to characteristics 
such as the nature of their factors;
•  Understand various meanings of multiplication and 
division;

•  Understand and use properties of operations, such as the 
distributivity of multiplication over addition;
•  Develop ﬂ uency with basic number combinations for 
multiplication and division and use these combinations to 
mentally compute related problems, such as 30  50;
•  Develop ﬂ uency in adding, subtracting, multiplying, and 
dividing whole numbers;
•  Develop and use strategies to estimate the results of 
whole-number computations and to judge the reason-
ableness of such results;
•  Select appropriate methods and tools for computing with 
whole numbers from among mental computation, esti-
mation, calculators, and paper and pencil according to 
the context and nature of the computation and use the 
selected method or tools.
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  Develop an understanding of large numbers and recog-
nize and appropriately use exponential, scientiﬁ c, and cal-
culator notation;
•  Use factors, multiples, prime factorization, and relatively 
prime numbers to solve problems;
•  Develop meaning for integers and represent and compare 
quantities with them;
•  Use the associative and commutative properties of ad-
dition and multiplication and the distributive property 
of multiplication over addition to simplify computations 
with integers, fractions, and decimals;
•  Understand and use the inverse relationships of addition 
and subtraction, multiplication and division, and squaring 
and ﬁ nding square roots to simplify computations and 
solve problems;
•  Develop and use strategies to estimate the results of 
rational-number computations and judge the reasonable-
ness of the results.
Addition and Subtraction Strategies 
for Larger Numbers
Introducing children to addition strategies with 
larger numbers follows the same instructional se-
quence used for introducing and teaching children 
basic addition. Problem situations are represented 
with materials and pictures and ﬁ nally recorded 
with numerals and symbols. For example:
•  Yesterday Jorje had 40 baseball cards. Today he 
bought 30 more. How many cards does he have 
(see Figure 12.1a)?
•  Angela had 72 cents in dimes and pennies. She 
spent 45 cents on a pencil. How much money 
does she have now (see Figure 12.1b)?
Students model problems such as these with base-
ball cards or coins. They can represent the op-
erations with index cards, plastic coins, or base-10 
blocks showing tens and ones. They can also draw 
pictures and write number sentences.
Modeling operations with materials shows stu-
dents how adding (combining) or subtracting (sep-
arating) larger numbers follows the same rules as 
basic facts. While working with materials and ex-
plaining their actions, students may “invent” the tra-
ditional algorithm or alternative strategies (Activity 
12.1). Each operation has several valid algorithms, 
and some are the dominant ones in other cultures 
and countries.
Algorithms for Addition. The traditional, or 
conventional, algorithm for addition is commonly 
referred to as carrying, but it is more accurately 
called regrouping and renaming or trading up.

Chapter 10 understand the rules for trading 10 ones 
for 1 ten and 10 tens for 1 hundred. For example:
•  Genevieve had 26 colored markers in her art kit. 
Her uncle gave her 17 markers. How many did she 
have?
Bean sticks show the regrouping for Genevieve’s 
markers in Figure 12.2. After putting the three bean 
sticks together, combine the loose beans (6  7), 
and then trade 10 beans for a bean stick, leaving 3 
loose beans. The new bean stick combines with the 
existing 3 for a total of 4 bean sticks, or 4 tens.
Using manipulatives as a model for operations 
allows students to record what they see, to talk 
through the process they have completed, and then 
to write the steps:
Ronnie: We put the sticks together. That gives us 3 
sticks, or 30.
Enrique: We’ll add the beans 6  7 for 13 beans.
Liane: Then, we regroup 10 beans and exchange 
them for a stick.
Johanna: Write down 3 for the number of beans, 
and put the tens stick with the other tens.
Teacher: How can we record that we have an 
extra ten?
Justin: Write it in the tens column because it is 1 ten.
Huang: Now we have 1 ten  2 tens  1 ten, or 4 
tens. Write the 4 in the tens column below the line.

Manipulative materials are a physical model to 
demonstrate the operation, but they have served 
their purpose when students understand the actions 
with numbers up to 1,000. Some students need con-
crete models longer than other students and con-
tinue to use them until they feel conﬁ dent with the 
algorithm. Adding and subtracting numbers larger 
than 1,000 becomes cumbersome to model with 
base-10 materials, but students have learned that 
the same exchange processes take place with any 
size number.
Work with the hundreds chart also illustrates ad-
dition (and subtraction) with tens and ones. Starting 
at 26, Genevieve could count forward 17 places to 
reach 43. After several examples, children usually 
ﬁ nd the shortcut for adding 10 by moving down one 
row rather than counting forward 10. They may also 
notice that they can go down two rows to 46 and left 
3 numbers to 43. Adding 20 and subtracting 3 has 
the same result as adding 17 (Figure 12.3).
ACTIVITY 12.1
 
Thinking Strategies for Two-Digit Addition (Problem Solving, 
Reasoning, and Mathematical Representation)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students add two numbers between 9 and 100.
Materials: Counters, base-10 materials
•  Tell a story based on a classroom situation. For example, 
“There are 28 children in Ms. Quay’s class and 29 in our 
class. If everybody can go on the ﬁ eld trip to the zoo, how 
many children are going?”
•  Ask students to model the situation with objects, place-
value materials, or pictures. Some count a set of 28 and a 
set of 29 objects, and others use place-value materials to 
show 20  8  20  9  57. Some might draw a picture, 
or use a different sequence such as 30  30  60 and 
then subtract 3.
•  Ask students to discuss their thinking. Compare the an-
swers to see if the strategies work.
•  Record the thinking that students present in number sen-
tences and/or vertical notation.

While students are learning about regrouping, 
they are also learning that regrouping is not always 
necessary. If they survey the problem, they can de-
cide whether the sums in any column are greater 
than 10. By presenting regrouping and nonregroup-
ing problems, teachers encourage students to think 
about each problem before starting. Different prob-
lems can be solved in different ways.
Most people learned the traditional addition al-
gorithm with regrouping, but regrouping is not the 
only, or even the best, algorithm in all situations. 
All the operations have alternative algorithms with 
steps that differ from the traditional algorithm, but 
the results are equally valid mathematical pro-
cesses. Alternative algorithms, also referred to as 
low-stress, transitional, or teaching algorithms, have 
advantages for many students. They often preserve 
the meaning of the number and place value better, 
are easy to model with materials, connect to esti-
mation and mental computation processes, and re-
quire less memorization of steps than the traditional 
algorithms. Alternative algorithms also require stu-
dents to think about the procedure and recognize 
that several solution strategies are possible. Instead 
of learning only one right way, they begin to think, 
“Which procedure makes more sense to me?” and 
“Which procedure is most efﬁ cient and effective in 
this situation?”
In addition, a common alternative algorithm in-
volves adding numbers in the largest place value 
(left digits) ﬁ rst and recording that partial sum. In 
turn, each place value to the right is then added, 
and partial sums are recorded. For example, the 
model and discussion for adding 26 pencils and 17 
pencils leads to an expanded alternative algorithm 
and a low-stress alternative algorithm. Note that the 
low-stress algorithm is a form of expanded notation 
addition.

The usefulness of the low-stress algorithm is more 
apparent as the numbers grow in size:
•  Mr. Gilbert ordered bags of birdseed. He had 358 
in the storeroom and received a new shipment of 
267. How many bags of birdseed did he have?
Figure 12.4 shows a student model for adding the 
ones, tens, and hundreds with materials. These mod-
els can be recorded in either expanded notation or 
the low-stress form. These models provide a bridge 
to the traditional algorithm as students see that re-
grouping is represented in three different formats.
Because both the expanded notation and the 
low-stress algorithm move students toward under-
standing the traditional algorithm, many teachers 
introduce them ﬁ rst, thus the names transitional 
or teaching algorithms. Base-10 blocks can also 
be used to model the steps for the expanded nota-
tion or low-stress algorithm by putting the hundreds 
together and writing that sum, then the tens, then 
the ones:

digit because its place value gives it the greatest 
value.
Many students have problems with the traditional 
algorithm. They do not know why they put “ﬂ ying 
1’s” above the addends. Many also have alignment 
problems writing the regrouped numbers above the 
problem. Some even begin by putting 1’s over every 
column before they determine whether regrouping 
is needed because they have not looked to see if 
regrouping is needed or because they do not under-
stand what is going on at all. The low-stress algo-
rithm changes the old rule from “Always begin in 
the ones place” to “Keep the hundreds together, the 
tens together, and the ones together.” In algebra this 
rule will become “Combine the x values, then the y
values.”
Compensation is another alternative approach 
that encourages mental computation. Students ad-
just the original addends to simplify the addition. 
Then they correct, or compensate, in the ﬁ nal an-
swer. Students who have played the exchange game 
from Chapter 10 are familiar with compensation. If 
they have 7 ones on the trading board and roll 5 on 
the dice, instead of counting out ﬁ ve more cubes, 
students learn to pick up a rod for 10 and put 5 cubes 
back in the bank. The result is still 12 on the board, 
but students have arrived at the result through com-
pensating—adding 10 and subtracting 5. Here is an-
other example:
Teacher: Ms. Gideon started driving to Salt Lake 
City at 8:00 in the morning. At 1:00 in the afternoon, 
her trip odometer read 287 miles, and she saw a 
sign “Salt Lake City 100 miles.” How many miles will 
she drive on her trip? Work the problem on your 
place-value mat, and tell me what you did.
Keisha: We put 2 hundreds, 8 tens, and 7 ones on 
our mat. Then we added 100 on the mat. The trip 
was 387 miles long (Figure 12.5a).
Teacher: What is the distance if the sign reads 99 
miles to Salt Lake City?
Lindo: It would be 386 miles because it was 1 mile 
shorter.
Teacher: Start with 287 on your board. How could 
you show addition of 99? Is there more than one 
way?
Huang: We put 9 tens and 9 ones on the mat and 
regrouped to get 386.
Walter: We put 100 on the mat and took off 1 be-
cause it is the same as adding 99 (Figure 12.5b).
When students are comfortable with the process 
of adding 100 and subtracting 1, they ﬁ nd ways to use 
compensation to adjust a cumbersome regrouping 
problem into an easier problem for mental computa-
tion and eliminate regrouping in many problems.

Decomposition, the traditional subtraction al-
gorithm, is modeled in the exchange game from 
Chapter 10 when students start with 100 or 1,000 and 
remove chips on each turn. Although commonly 
called borrowing, decomposition is another exam-
ple of regrouping and renaming, or trading down. 
Decomposition involves the same steps as addition 
but involves trading down rather than trading up:
•  Bandar saved $50 and spent $30 for clothes. How 
much does he have?
•  The sneakers cost $47. I have $29 now. How much 
more do I need?
•  Ani’s family was shopping for a digital camera. The 
list price was $573. The same camera was for sale 
on the Internet for $385. How much can they save?
The stories can be acted out using play money, then 
with base-10 blocks. Students regroup and rename 
hundreds to tens and tens to ones with materials in 
each situation, or they draw simple diagrams. Stu-
dents can represent $573 with base-10 materials, as 
shown in Figure 12.7a. In Figure 12.7b a ten rod has 
been exchanged for 13 one rods. Figure 12.7c shows 
that 100 is exchanged to make a total of 16 tens. Af-
ter regrouping, 5 ones, 8 tens, and 3 hundreds are 
removed (Figure 12.7d). As in addition, decomposi-
tion is related to expanded notation:

Assess understanding of addition by interviewing 
three to ﬁ ve students. Present each of the follow-
ing problems, and ask them to “think aloud” as 
they work. Do they use the traditional algorithm? 
Does their thinking reﬂ ect knowledge of regroup-
ing? Do any of them use the low-stress algorithm or 
compensation?

Algorithms for Subtraction. Procedures for sub-
traction with larger numbers are related to addition 
processes. Subtraction between 20 and 100 can be 
modeled with manipulatives and simple pictures or 
on the hundreds chart. Subtraction of tens is eas-
ily understood when children have been count-

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
A cooperative activity in Activity 12.2 illustrates stu-
dents exploring decomposition.
Decomposition is difﬁ cult for many children if 
they memorize steps because each problem has 
a unique regrouping situation. Instead, they can 
look at each place value and decide if regrouping 
is needed.
Experience with physically trading from hun-
dreds to tens to ones is important. Frances Thomp-
son (1991) found that students who actually ma-
nipulated materials showing the decomposition 
process understood and retained skill in subtracting 
two-digit numbers better than those who watched 
demonstrations but did not actually exchange the 
materials. For example:
•  If 306 plants were purchased for the garden and 
148 were already planted, how many still needed 
to be planted?

Students who are comfortable with various rep-
resentations of 306 know that it can be called 30 
tens and 6 ones. By regrouping 1 ten as 10 ones, 
they have 29 tens and 16 ones, or 2 hundreds, 9 tens, 
and 16 ones. Subtraction is completed by subtract-
ing 8 from 16, 4 tens from 9 tens, and 1 hundred 
from 2 hundreds, or 29 tens  14 tens and 16 ones 
 8 ones.
Alternative Algorithms for Subtraction.  Sev eral 
alternative algorithms are possible for subtraction 
of larger numbers. The equal-addition algorithm
for subtraction is well known in Europe and other 
parts of the world but has been used infrequently 
in the United States. The mathematical concept 
behind the algorithm is simple—many subtrac -
 tion combinations have the same answer. For exam-
ple, many subtraction problems have a difference 
of 28:

Some number combinations are easy to calculate 
(58  30), whereas others (e.g., 164  136) are per-
ceived as more difﬁ cult.

age of another person who is older. Ask what the

MISCONCEPTION
Zero in subtraction can create several problems for students. 
If students ﬁ nd 0 in the tens place, they may skip to the hun-
dreds place and regroup directly to the ones place without 
ﬁ rst making 100 into 10 tens. The other problem that students 
experience with 0 in the subtraction is to switch the subtrac-
tion order from, say, 0  8 to 8  0. Modeling problems with 
place-value materials and using expanded notation helps 
students understand the correct procedure for both of these 
problems. In this example the student demonstrates both 
mistakes in decomposition:

ence will be when both of them are 3 years older, 
5 years older, and 10 years older. Students will recog-
nize that the number of years between the two ages 
remains constant. Ask them to suggest a rule for 
what they see, for example, “If the same number is 
added to both ages, the difference is still the same.” 
Students who understand how this rule works are 
ready to use equal addition as a written algorithm 
or mental computation strategy:
•  Hawthorn School had 678 students. When a new 
school was built, 199 Hawthorn students were 
transferred to it. How many students are enrolled 
at Hawthorn now?
Subtracting 199 from 678 is seen as a hard problem by 
many children, but subtracting 200 from 679 seems 
simple. Increasing both 678 and 199 by 1 makes a 
hard computation into an easier one.

Students who understand the logic of equal ad-
ditions ﬁ nd it a quick mental computation strategy 
for some problems.
•  The Olympic torch was carried across the United 
States on a journey of 7,592 miles. At Columbus, 
Ohio, the runners had already covered 2,305 
miles. How many miles were left?
In this case students look for a convenient number 
to add or subtract from both numbers in the prob-
lem. The 5 in 2,305 appears to be an easy number to 
subtract, but adding 5 to each number also simpli-
ﬁ es the computation.
Think: Add 5 to both numbers
 
7,592 
Add 5: 7,592  5  
7,597
 
2,305 
Add 5: 2,305  5   2,310

Or subtract 5  from both numbers
  
Subtract 5:  7,592  5   7,587
  
Subtract 5:  2,305  5  2,300
  
 
5,287
Equal-addition reasoning also leads to a more 
sophisticated type of equal-addition problem. If stu-
dents put 497 on the place-value mat and add 10 to 
it, they could add 10 ones or 1 ten. Adding 100 to 
any number could be done by adding 10 tens or by 
adding 1 hundred. In the Olympic torch problem 
both the total miles and the current mileage are ad-
justed by 10. The total miles has 10 ones added to 
the ones place; the addend has 1 ten added to the 
tens place:

Subtract

After the numbers are adjusted by adding 10 to each 
of them, subtraction proceeds left to right or right to 
left, because the regrouping is already completed.

•  Tell each team to solve the problem, using any way they 
choose. Ask each team to write the mathematical sen-
tence for the situation with their answer: 82  53  ?.
•  Present a second, similar problem. Team members work in 
pairs to solve this problem. When pairs are ﬁ nished, they 
compare their work and clear any discrepancies.
•  Present a third problem, which each member of a team 
solves. Again, team members compare their answers.
•  Call on one team member to explain the solutions to each

for each solution. Probe for decomposition as an effective 
strategy.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Students skilled with equal additions perform sub-
traction rapidly. Students who went to school in an-
other country might demonstrate the process for the 
class.
See “Subtracting with Equal Additions,” one of 
many activities on the companion website, for an 
example of how to introduce the equal-addition 
algorithm.
Compensation with subtraction is similar to com-
pensation with addition. In the Hawthorn School 
problem of losing 199 students to a new school, stu-
dents might notice that 199 is close to 200, allowing 
them to subtract 200 and then add 1 back:
 678 
678
199
200 
Think: Subtract 200 and add 1
 
478  1  479
After inventing or learning about alternative al-
gorithms, students are able to consider whether de-
composition, expanded notation, equal additions, 
or compensation is the efﬁ cient way to approach 
the problem. Making decisions about the faster and 
easier computational approach is part of computa-
tional ﬂ uency.
The low-stress algorithm for subtraction is similar 
to the low-stress algorithm for addition with an ad-
ditional element of negative integers. After working 
with positive and negative numbers on a number 
line or thermometer, intermediate-grade students 
should be comfortable with the idea of “below zero.” 
Beginning at the left, subtraction is done for each 
place value, including those resulting in a negative 
value:
•  The school carnival collected $5,162. They paid 
$3,578 for supplies and concessions.

 2,000  400 is 1,600; 1,600  10 is 1,590; 
1,590  6 is 1,584
Many students ﬁ nd that a low-stress procedure is 
easier than decomposition because each place 
value is calculated by itself before combining them 
for the ﬁ nal answer. Low-stress algorithms also pre-
pare students for front-end estimation and can be a 
mental computation strategy.

Mental Computation. Mental computation is 
used with estimation and rounding and instead of 
algorithms to get exact answers. People look for 
number combinations and multiples of 10, 100, or 
1,000 that make calculations easy. Numbers that add 
to combinations and multiples of 10 are called com-
patible numbers. For example:
•  The votes for Geraldo for class president were 72, 
15, 36, 43, and 93.
Rearranging numbers in the tens column gives 70 
30 and 10  90 plus 40  240. In the ones column, 
2  3  5  10 and 6  3  9, totaling 19. The mental 
sum is 240  19  259.
Mental calculations for subtraction use tech-
niques from estimation and alternative algorithms. 
Several different approaches to mental calculations 
are possible.
• Yusef needed $75 to buy a DVD player. He had 
saved $48. How much more did he need?
Round to nearest $5 and compensate:
$75  $50  $25   $25  $2  $27
Add 2 to both numbers and subtract:
$77  $50  $27
Expand and subtract:
$70  $40  $30
$5  $8  $3   $30  $3  $27
Think-aloud practice with mental computation 
and estimation at the beginning of a class period 
can be done by writing four addition or subtraction 
examples. Have students work in pairs and compare 
their answers.

Exploring Multiplication Algorithms. Multipli-
cation and division of two- and three-digit num-
bers are a logical extension of earlier work with the
operations. Following development of place value, 
understanding of operations, and basic facts, stu-
dents apply commutative, associative, and distribu-
tive properties with base-10 materials to explore tra-
ditional and alternative algorithms:
•  Johnny bought 3 dozen bagels for the meeting. 
Instead of getting 12 in a dozen, he got a baker’s 
dozen of 13 bagels. How many bagels did he buy?
Modeling the story with materials, as in Figure 12.8a, 
students see that 3 groups of 13 is the same as 3 
groups of 10 and 3 groups of 3:
3  13  3  (10  3)
(3  10)  (3  3)  30  9
Expanded notation using the distributive property 
reﬂ ects the place-value model and sets the stage for 
E
the traditional algorithm (Figure 12.8b). A lesson us-
ing books is described in Activity 12.3.
Traditional and alternative algorithms use the 
distributive property; however, the steps can be re-
corded in different ways

oranges in each bag, how many oranges would 
he have?

many cookies were sold?

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
The traditional algorithm requires short-term 
memory while performing other operations as stu-
dents switch back and forth between multiplica-
tion and addition. The alternative algorithm records 
each step with partial products. All the multiplica-
tion operations are completed before addition is 
performed. Writing the entire number for each par-
tial product also keeps the place values lined up 
without use of blank spaces or X’s.
Decade Multiplication. As children begin to work
with larger numbers in multiplication, an important
step is building their knowledge and skill with mul-
tiples of 10 and 100. Because products greater than 
1,000 become cumbersome to draw or to model with 
materials, children should
develop conﬁ dence with 
mental calculations for 
problems such as 20  
30 and 40  800. These 
products are needed for 
alternative and traditional 
algorithms. Because these
problems involve multi-
ples of 10, they are called
decade multiplication. De-
cade multiplication is crit-
ical for success with multi-
plication, division, mental 
computation, and estima-
tion of larger numbers, but 
it is sometimes taught as a 
rule without developing 
the reason behind it.
Teachers should intro-
duce multiplication with 
10 and 100 in realistic situ-
ations and as an extension 
of learning number facts 
so that students see pat-
terns of multiplication by 
10 and 100:
•  A dime is 10 pennies; 2 dimes is 20 cents.
•  Jaime had 7 dimes: 7  10  70 cents.
•  Diego had 20 dimes: 20  10  200 cents.
Students can make a scale model of the school 
grounds using an orange Cuisenaire rod  100 feet. 
The front fence is 7 rods long: 7  100  700 feet.

MISCONCEPTION
Notation for the tradi-
tional algorithm creates 
problems for many 
students. Teachers may 
suggest leaving spaces or 
putting X’s as placehold-
ers during multiplication, 
but these tend to weaken 
mathematical understand-
ing of multiplication by 10, 
100, or larger multiples. 
The partial sums found in 
the alternative and transi-
tional algorithms preserve 
the value of numbers. If 
the traditional algorithm 
needs regrouping twice or 
in both the ones and the 
tens place, many children 
have difﬁ culty keeping 
numbers organized and 
separated. Others cannot 
remember whether to 
multiply and then add or 
to add and then multiply 
the renamed tens and 
hundreds. These proce-
dural problems relate 
to poor understanding 
of place value.

Other illustrations use different multiples of 10 or

•  Thirty classes at Upward Elementary each raised 
$50 for hurricane relief: 30  $50  $1,500.
•  The school sweatshirts cost $20, and 150 students 
ordered one: 150  $20  $3,000.
•  On the 100th day of school, students determined 
how many minutes they had been in school: 300 
minutes per day  100 days  30,000 minutes.
The calculator is an excellent learning tool for 
students to explore a variety of decade products. 
Have students work the following examples using 
a calculator:

500  60  30,000
 
500  600  300,000
From a study of situations like these, ask students 
to propose a decade multiplication rule. After some 
discussion they will state something like “Multiply 
the numbers at the front and put zeros on the end.” 
This is a good start, but it needs more work. They 
clearly see the pattern related to the number of ze-
ros. The more important idea is that the number of 
zeros is the number of tens being multiplied shown 
in expanded notation using the associative and 
distributive laws. Students also need to be aware 
of situations when the multiplication of the leading 
numbers results in a factor of 10. Students who have 
an understanding of the number of tens being mul-
tiplied are also setting a foundation for exponential

Distribution (Representation and Reasoning)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups or whole class
Objective: Students multiply a two-digit number by a one-digit 
number without regrouping.
Materials: 36 books (preferably identical, such as a set of reading 
texts), linking cubes for each child
•  Arrange the 36 books into sets of 12. Display the three 
sets and tell the children, “I have 3 sets of 12 books. How 
many books are there all together?”
•  Have students consider the problem and discuss ways to 
determine the answer. For example: Count the books; add 
12  12  12; skip count by 12’s; or multiply 3  12.
•  Write the multiplication sentence 3  12  36 and then

•  Separate the books so that each set shows 10 books and 
2 books. Hold up the 3 groups of 2 books. Ask: “How 
many books are in these 3 sets of 2 books?” Show the 
multiplication of 3  2 in the algorithm.
•  Point to the 3 groups of 10 books. Ask: “How many

Extending Algorithms for Larger Numbers. By 
learning decade multiplication and division, chil-
dren develop mental computation strategies, es-
tablish skills for front-end estimation, and take an 
important step toward multiplication and division 
with larger numbers before they begin working with 
algorithms. Consider the following problem:
•  Each box contains 24 apples. Jamie has 47 boxes 
to sell. How many apples are being sold?
The distributive property of multiplication over 
addition is the foundation for algorithms. A major 
difference between the traditional algorithm and 
an alternative algorithm is notation. The alternative 
algorithm records a partial product for each multi-
plication, starting at the left with the largest place 
value. A transitional algorithm also records all the 
partial products but starts with multiplication in the 
ones place. The traditional algorithm has all the 
same steps but requires that students regroup and 
remember whether they are multiplying or adding 
during each step.
Activity 12.4 illustrates multiplication with re-
grouping in a cooperative group lesson. This format 
encourages students to explore multiplication and 
to create alternative algorithms.
Students should not devote extensive time to mul-
tiplying three-digit and larger numbers. All children 
should learn one or more algorithms that they can 
use efﬁ ciently and accurately for these problems. 
Students who are efﬁ cient with alternative or tran-
sitional algorithms may never need to learn a tradi-
tional algorithm. Other students prefer the compact 
and efﬁ cient nature of the traditional algorithm and 
seem to have no problems with the notation. Some 
students switch from one algorithm to another de-
pending on the numbers. Learning different algo-
rithms gives all students power and ﬂ exibility with 
multiplication of larger numbers, although in real 
life they are more likely to use a calculator or to use 
estimation. Several other multiplication algorithms 
are interesting for students to explore. The historical 
algorithms in Activity 12.5 show that mathematics 
has evolved over many centuries and that many cul-
tures have contributed.
Introducing Division Algorithms. Division with 
larger numbers builds on ideas and skills developed 
for division with smaller numbers and place value. 
To use division algorithms successfully, students 
should understand both partitive and measurement 
division situations, know the multiplication and divi-
sion facts, including decade multiplication, and be 
able to add and subtract accurately. When working 
with early division situations, students recognize 
that division is related to multiplication facts.

•  Twenty-eight marbles are shared equally by six 
children. How many marbles will each child have?
When students divide 28 objects into 6 groups, they 
place 4 objects in each group with 4 extra (Figure 
12.10). They also record the word and number sen-
tences to represent this story.
•  Twenty-eight marbles divided by 6 people  4 
marbles each with a remainder of 4:
28  6  4, remainder 4
Each child has four marbles, but there are not 
enough for each child to have ﬁ ve. This situation is 
partitive or sharing; however, the reasoning is simi-
lar in measurement, or repeated subtraction, divi-
sion situations.

Multiplication with Regrouping (Representation)
Level: Grades 3– 5

•  Allow time for each team to discuss how to determine 
the product. When agreement is reached, each member 
solves the problem using the procedures. Have team 
members consult a second time to check their work.
•  Have each team explain what it did. Teams should dem-
onstrate how materials were used. For example, one team 
might use squared paper. Call on a student to explain. For 
example, a student may say, “First, we colored squares to 
show 7 times 14. Next, we cut the paper to show 7 times 
4 and 7 times 10. We know that 7 times 4 is 28 and 7 
times 10 is 70, so 28 and 70 make 98.” Teams that used 
algorithms might have representations such as these:

Objective: Students explore historical multiplication algorithms to 
see how they work.
Materials: None
Lattice, or Gelosia, Multiplication
Multiplication using the lattice method is done in a lat-
tice, or gelosia. The lattice method is easy to use because 
no addition is done until all multiplication is completed. 
The method is demonstrated with the multiplication of 
23 and 68:
•  Make a lattice, and write one factor across the top and 
the other down the right side.
•  Ask students to multiply 3  8, 3  6, 2  8, and 2  6 
and to write the product for each pair of numbers in the 
appropriate cell of the lattice.
•  Add the numbers in each diagonal, beginning at the lower 
right. The excess of tens in the diagonal that contains 6, 
2, and 8 is regrouped and added in the next diagonal. The 
product is represented by the numbers outside the lattice, 
beginning at the top left.
•  Ask students to compare the lattice to the alternative or 
traditional algorithms and to tell how place value is repre-
sented on the lattice.
•  Have students work individually or in groups to ﬁ gure out 
how this method works with larger numbers, such as 236 
 498.
•  Ask students to explain how the Egyptian method works. 
What property is demonstrated in this method? (Answer: 
Distributive property of multiplication over addition.)
•  Ask students to ﬁ gure out how to multiply 13  26 using 
the Egyptian method:

Russian Peasant Multiplication
The Russian peasant process, similar to the Egyptian pro-
cess, is based on doubling. However, a different method 
determines which partial products are kept.
•  Demonstrate the Russian peasant process for 48  28. 
Write 48 in the ﬁ rst column and 28 in the second column. 
In the next row the 48 is divided by 2 and 28 is doubled. 
The division-by-2 and doubling process continues until 1 
is at the bottom of the left column. Then add the doubled 
numbers in the second column that appear next to odd 
numbers in the ﬁ rst row. Doubled numbers adjacent to 
even numbers are discarded.

•  If an odd number is divided by 2, the remainder of 1 is 
dropped, as in the following example, 37  57. Again, 
only the doubled numbers adjacent to odd numbers are 
added to determine the product. Those next to even num-
bers are discarded.

if they can ﬁ gure out how it works. Can you?

Napier’s rods, another multiplication process, was 
invented by John Napier in 1617. Students should be 
able to ﬁ nd several websites that describe Napier’s rods 
and how to construct them. Challenge students to ﬁ nd

to make a set to demonstrate this early computational 
device.

Egyptian Multiplication
The Egyptian process of multiplication is one of doubling 
and adding partial products:
•  Model the problem 7  21 by writing two columns. In 
the ﬁ rst column place 1, and in the second column 21. In 
the next row, double the 1 and the 21; in the third row, 
double both numbers again. Stop doubling when any 
combination of numbers in the left column adds to 7 or 
higher.

The divisor is subtracted from the dividend as many 
times as possible.
•  How many times did we distribute the six mar-
bles? (Answer: Four times.)
•  How many marbles were unshared? (Answer: 
Four marbles.)
The repeated subtractions are shown in number 
sentences and in the division bracket:
28  6  22
22  6  16
16  6  10
10  6   4
Many division problems can be solved by inspec-
tion because they draw on knowledge of multiplica-
tion facts. Using multiplication facts to solve division 
problems with dividends up to 100 is developed with 
“think-back” ﬂ ash cards. A child is shown the front 
of the card with the division algorithm and thinks 
of the closest fact associated with that division. 
The back of the 
card shows the 
nearest fact. If a 
student is shown 
the card in Fig-
ure 12.11, the stu-
dent thinks of the 
related division 
fact “72 divided 
by 8 equals 9.” 
When a student cannot think back to the correct 
basic fact, show the fact on the back of the card. Fre-
quent group and individual work with these cards 
helps children develop skill in naming quotients.
As the numbers increase in size, students have 
difﬁ culty predicting appropriate trial quotients 
through inspection. An alternative algorithm, called 
the ladder method, allows students to see each sub-
traction and gives them great ﬂ exibility in choosing 
their trial quotients. Division is a more efﬁ cient way 
to record the process than many subtractions.
Activity 12.6 shows how children use base-10 
blocks to model division and relate the materials 
to recording the algorithm. Because the parts of the 
algorithm can be directly related to actions with 
bean sticks or other manipulative materials, stu-
dents see meaning in the steps as the algorithm is 
completed.
Real-world situations help students understand 
division involving larger numbers just as they did 
with basic facts. Children who use the traditional 
algorithm of guessing, multiplying, subtracting, 
and bringing down often have difﬁ culty predicting 
reasonable numbers for starting the division. They 
also have difﬁ culty lining up numbers and knowing 
how many numbers to bring down. The alternative 
algorithm allows students to build the ﬁ nal answer 
by multiplying any two numbers that the child ﬁ nds 
easy instead of having to get the best or closest trial 
quotient. In either case children should have skill 
and conﬁ dence in mental calculations, including 
decade multiplication. Without ready recall of ad-
dition, subtraction, and multiplication facts, they 
cannot focus on the meaning of division with larger 
numbers. For example:
•  A farmer has 288 oranges to bag for market. If she 
puts the oranges into 24 bags, how many oranges 
will be in each bag?
How many times can I subtract 24 from 288?
24288  
Think: 
  240 
10 
10  24  240
 
48 
 
288  240  48
48 
 2 
2  24  48
 
0 
 
48  48  0
 24 can be subtracted from 288 12 times.
Relate each numeral in the algorithm to the prob-
lem situation so that students understand each one’s 
meaning. When talking through the problem, model 
the actions by putting 10 oranges in each bag in the 
algorithm, then place 2 more in each bag. The lad-
der algorithm uses the same thinking questions as 
the teacher and student record their work.
Students usually need several more examples 
with guided practice or working with a partner be-
fore they gain conﬁ dence in the ladder method. The 
alternative method gives students ﬂ exibility when 
they cannot identify a trial quotient. They use any 
reasonable quotient that is easy to multiply and sub-
tract. Different students may ﬁ nd quotients by using 
facts that they consider easier. The ladder algorithm 
can be simpliﬁ ed once the process is understood.

Only the multiplier needs to be written down, either 
on the side or above the bracket:
•  Sam drove 3,174 miles on 123 gallons of gas. What 
was his mileage (miles per gallon)?
Despite using different number combinations, both 
students calculated the answer correctly. The re-
mainder 99 is interpreted as 99
123 (or about 0.8 of a 
gallon). The fuel efﬁ ciency of the car was almost 26 
miles per gallon.
Enough work is needed so that students under-
stand the meaning and the thinking behind the al-
gorithm. However, extensive exercises with division 
of larger numbers are no longer seen as useful. In-
stead, more time should be spent on problem-solv-
ing situations with multiplication and division in

dents need to complete to show their understand-

Number Sense, Estimation, 
and Reasonableness
While students learn computational algorithms, 
they are also developing number sense skills, such 
as estimation, rounding, and reasonableness. These 
skills are particularly important with larger num-
bers. For example:
•  If one bank has deposits of $45,173, 893, and the 
other bank holds $37,093,103, how much will be 
deposited if they merge?
•  The population of the largest city is 10,987,463, 
and the population of the second largest city is 
6,423,932? How many more people live in the 
larger city?
•  The hybrid car gets 37 miles per gallon. If the gas 
tank holds 16 gallons of gas, how many miles can 
it go on a full tank?
•  The seven-day cruise costs $539. What is the cost 
per day for the vacation?

In 
some 
instances 
exact 
calculations 
are 
needed, but often estima-
tion, mental calculations, 
and calculators can be 
used instead of paper-
and-pencil 
procedures. 
Students 
who 
possess 
computational 
ﬂ uency 
recognize which compu-
tational approach is best in different situations, de-
pending on the accuracy needed.
Problems with two- and three-digit numbers 
demonstrate the need for estimation to attain a fast 
approximation. Estimation is most valuable for num-
bers in the thousands and larger or when several 
addends are considered. Procedures for front-end 
estimation and rounding estimation are similar to 
alternative algorithms that start in the largest place 
value for the ﬁ rst approximation. If more precision is 
needed, students can adjust the answer to improve 
the estimate by including the next place value. For 
example:
•  Students were tracking the energy usage of their 
school. Over four months the electrical usage was 
2,345 kWh, 6,526 kWh, 3,445 kWh, and 3,152 kWh.
Intermediate-grade students make a front-end 
estimate by adding the thousands and adjust the es-
timate by adding the sum of the hundreds:

The front-end estimate is 14,000, and the adjusted 
estimate is 15,300. Values in the tens and ones places 
are ignored because they add little to the sum. If stu-
dents round the addends to the hundreds place, the 
estimate is 15,400. Any of these estimates serve as 
reasonable comparisons for an answer using a cal-
culator. If the calculator answer is close to 19,000 or 
1,500, the estimates would be clues that something 
is wrong, When rounding, students determine how

much accuracy is needed and round each number 
to that place. Addends for the previous example 
could be rounded to the nearest 1,000, 500, or 100.
When teaching estimation strategies, teachers 
model the process by thinking aloud. Students then 
think aloud in pairs or small groups to verbalize es-
timation and mental computation processes. Com-
paring front-end estimation to adjusted and rounded 
estimation helps students determine whether one 
method is better than the other for the purpose of 
the problem. Estimation in subtraction also uses 
front-end estimation and rounding techniques:
•  Lando wants to buy a car that costs $7,358. He 
has a down payment of $2,679. How much money 
will he borrow to complete the purchase?

The loan ofﬁ cer at the bank calculates the ex-

gives a sense of what is involved before starting 
paperwork.
Both front-end estimation and rounding are ef-
ﬁ cient ways to estimate products. Students can use 
either process, depending on the size of the number 
and the precision. Front-end estimation might adjust 
the answer by using the ﬁ rst two largest places. De-
cade multiplication is critical in making estimation 
quick and easy. For example:

grow, he expects each tree to produce about 85 
pounds of pecans.

Flexible thinking is needed as students compare 
and decide which result is best for different estima-
tion procedures—front-end, adjusted, and round-
ing. Continuing the pecan tree example, a student 
might note that the front-end estimate of 8,000 is 
low and that rounding both factors up gives 11,700, 
which will be high. The other three estimates are in 
between, so the student thinks that the best estimate 
is probably about 10,500.
A sample problem on estimation from the Texas 
Assessment is shown in Figure 12.12. Children 
choose the best estimate based on reasonable low 
and high estimates.

Estimating quotients with larger numbers uses 
the logic learned with the alternative division algo-
rithm or by using multiplication. Decade multiplica-
tion is an essential skill in estimation of division. For 
example:
•  The school PTA raised $7,348 at its carnival. They 
decided to buy new printers for classrooms. If 
each printer costs $324, how many printers can 
they buy?
E

The teacher asks students whether the PTA could 
buy 10, 20, 30, 50, or 100 printers. The students rea-
son that 10 printers would cost about $3,200; that 20 
printers would cost twice as much, or about $6,400; 
and that 30 printers would cost about $9,600. They 
decide that the PTA could buy between 20 and 30 
printers. Another estimation adjusts the numbers by 
rounding the dividend and divisor to numbers that 
are easy to divide. Different students ﬁ nd different 
number combinations for estimation:
Ian: 7,500 divided by 500 is 15, and 7,500 divided by 
250 is 30; the answer is halfway between 15 and 30 
or about 22.
Heather: 7,000 divided by 350 is 20, so we should 
be able to buy a few more than 20 printers.
Sara: 7,200 divided by 600 is 12 and divided by 300 
is 24. I think the answer is close to 25.
Students compare their answers and thinking to 
see whether their estimates were reasonable. Both 
front-end estimation and rounding processes al-
low students to ﬁ nd a similar but simpler division 
problem.

Factorials (Reasoning)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups or whole class
Objective: Students model factorials, a sequence of multiplications 
1  2  3  4  5 . . . .
Materials: A copy of the book Anno’s Mysterious Multiplying Jar, 
by Masaichiro Anno and Mitsumasa Anno (New York: Philomel 
Books, 1983).
Anno’s Mysterious Multiplying Jar “is about one jar and 
what was inside it.” With this simple statement, Mit-
sumasa Anno and son Masaichiro Anno, a writer-artist 
team, begin their tale about a fascinating jar and its 
contents, introducing the topic of factorials to intermedi-
ate- and middle-grade students. Inside the jar was a sea 
of rippling water on which a ship appeared. The ship 
sailed to a single island. The island had two countries, 
each of which had three mountains with four walled 
kingdoms on each mountain, and each kingdom had 
ﬁ ve villages. Eventually students are asked to answer 
the question, “How many jars were in the boxes in the 
houses in the villages in the kingdoms, on the mountains, 
in the countries?”
•  Read the story, pausing to allow time for students to talk 
about how many countries, mountains, and kingdoms 
there are. Continue reading to the point where there are 
10 jars in each box, and ask, “How many jars were in all 
the boxes together?”
•  Give each student a large sheet of paper and crayons. 
Reread the story, allowing time for sketches to be drawn 
of the evolving scene.
•  Have students study their sketches to see if they can de-
termine the pattern that is developing. Have them discuss 
their ideas about the pattern. Ask them if they can write 
a multiplication sentence to show the situations in the 
pictures.
•  Tell students that the authors have represented the 
island’s growing number of objects. Turn to the page 
where the display of dots begins. Ask: “Why didn’t the 
authors show dots for the boxes and for the jars in the 
boxes? Students may use calculators to determine the 
products of larger numbers.
•  Introduce the term and numerical representation of facto-
rial. Children should come away from the activity with an 
understanding that the factorial symbol—10!—is equal to 
10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1, or 3,628,800, 
a very short way to write a very large number!
•  Students can create their own factorial stories and illus-
trate them. Their stories, pictures, and computations can 
be displayed on a factorial bulletin board.

Summary
Traditional algorithms can be taught; however, many stu-
dents have difﬁ culty with the traditional algorithms. The 
algorithms are often confusing because of placement of 
answers and because they involve switching from one 
operation to another several times. The larger the num-
bers become, the more complex the algorithm becomes 
and the more it places a memory burden on many stu-
dents who are trying to remember the steps.
Each of the operations has one or more alternative al-
gorithms that help students to develop their skill in com-
puting with larger numbers. Many algorithms are based 
on expanded notation, which emphasizes place value of 
numbers. Some algorithms allow students to adjust the 
numbers in a given problem to make the computation 
easier. Many alternative algorithms simplify computa-
tion by allowing students to write down partial answers 
as they work. In general, the alternative algorithms for 
each of the operations build on understanding of the op-
erations, preserve the meaning of numbers as students 
work, are easy to model with base-10 materials, and re-
quire less memory of steps while students are working. 
Many students are successful in computing with alterna-
tive forms; others use the traditional algorithm readily.
As students model problems and record answers, 
they build skills with estimation, rounding, and men-
tal computation. Several alternative algorithms parallel 
front-end estimation strategies because they are based 
on the numbers in the largest place value. Students can 
compare the results of different estimation strategies to 
decide what are reasonable answers to problems with 
large numbers. This skill is also valuable when using 
calculators and computers. Students should check cal-
culator answers against estimated answers to determine 
whether their estimates were reasonable. Computational 
ﬂ uency and ﬂ exibility means that teachers spend less 
time practicing paper-and-pencil algorithms and more 
time solving problems with larger numbers using a vari-
ety of computational approaches.

numbers. Were they hard or easy for you to re-

Developing 
Understanding 
of Common and 
Decimal Fractions
hildren’s study of fractional numbers begins as early as 
kindergarten and continues through middle school. 
Fractional numbers and concepts related to them—in 
the form of common fractions, decimal fractions, and 
percentages—are encountered in everyday settings by 
children and adults. Common fractions are used to express 
parts of wholes and sets, to express ratios, and to indicate division. “One-
half of a pie” refers to part of a whole; “one-half of 12 apples” refers to part 
of a set. If one apple is served for every two children, a ratio of 1 : 2 exists 
between the number of apples and the number of children; this ratio is 
also expressed as 1
2. Division, such as “2 divided by 4,” can be written as 
the common fraction 2
4. Common fractions are an integral part of the English, 
or common, system of measure, as indicated by quarter-inches, half-pounds, 
and thirds of cups. Decimal fractions are used to express parts of wholes and 
sets divided into tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and other fractional parts 
of tenths. They are used to express money in our monetary system ($1.23 
and $0.07) and represent various measurements in the metric system 
(0.1 decimeter or 0.01 meter).
 
As with other numbers, children’s work with fractional numbers be-
gins with real-world examples, and representations of fractional numbers 
are modeled with real materials and manipulatives. In all grades concrete 
representations help children develop a clear understanding of these num-

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Teaching children about common and decimal frac-
tions extends their understanding of number con-
cepts beyond knowledge about whole numbers. 
Knowledge of fractional numbers allows children 
to represent many aspects of their environment that 
would be unexplainable with only whole numbers, 
and it allows them to deal with problems involving 
measurement, probability, and statistics. Helping 
children build knowledge of fractions also broad-
ens their awareness of the power of numbers and 
extends their knowledge of number systems. The 
concepts of common and decimal fractions devel-
oped in elementary school lay the foundations on 
which more advanced understandings and applica-
tions are built in later grades.
bers, their uses, and the mathematical operations associated with them. In 
this chapter we focus on activities for developing foundational concepts of 
fractional numbers expressed as common and decimal fractions and related 
concepts. Activities featured in this chapter focus on concepts and skills 
involving operations with fractional numbers. Although percent is commonly 
linked with the study of fractions, we have chosen to consider percent in a 
different chapter. Chapter 15 includes a full discussion of percent and ratio 
and proportion.
 
The NCTM standards for number and operations suggest the following 
standard for fractions at this level.

What Teachers Need to Know 
About Teaching Common 
Fractions and Decimal Fractions
The role of manipulatives in learning about both 
common fractions and decimal fractions is ex-
tremely important. At times, teachers are tempted to 
hurry students beyond manipulatives and concrete 
models of fractional numbers into abstract compu-
tations. When students are moved along too quickly 
from concrete models to abstract computations, 
they never fully develop basic understandings of the 
fractional concepts and relationships. Consequently, 
they advance their understanding of fractional num-
bers by rote memorization and not from any con-
ceptual understanding. Knowledge about fractional 
numbers gained in this way is fragile. Teachers need 
to allow children sufﬁ cient time to engage with 
various models that represent fractions before they 
move on to symbolic aspects of fractional numbers. 
When students develop concepts about, and pro-
cesses with, fractional numbers slowly and carefully 
through activities with concrete materials and real-
istic settings, they avoid misconceptions that must 
be corrected later. Children also construct mean-
ing of fractional numbers by interacting with peers 
and adults. During this process, their understanding 
of fractions may not be identical to their teacher’s. 
Overemphasis of the teacher’s way of viewing these 
new numbers may inhibit students’ progress in un-
derstanding them. It is important, especially during 
early work with fractional numbers, to allow stu-
dents time to explore the meaning of these numbers 
and to build their conceptual understanding.
Table 13.1 suggests when various topics for com-
mon and decimal fractions might be beneﬁ cially 
introduced to children. Notice that introductory 
activities may stretch across several years in order 
to build a foundational understanding. Introductory 
activities are then followed by activities that main-
tain and/or extend understanding.
For example, the fact that common fractions 
(1
2) and decimal fractions (0.5) represent the same 
number is not understood by many students. One 
reason the connection between the two types of 
numerals may seem obscure is that instruction of 
common and decimal fractions is often completely 
separated. When students work with common frac-
tions at one time and decimal fractions at a different 
time, connections are often unclear or not made at 
all. Another reason is that most people use the term 
fraction when they refer to common fractions and 
the term decimal when they refer to decimal frac-
tions. Using the terms common fraction and decimal 
fraction helps students understand that both types 
of numerals are used to represent fractional num-
bers. Both numerals refer to parts of units or sets; 
the difference is that a common fraction represents 
units or sets separated into any number of parts 
(3 out of 5 or 3
5), whereas a decimal fraction repre-
sents units or sets separated into 10 parts or parts 
that are powers of 10 (0.6 or 6
10; 0.03 or 3
100). When 
percent is used, the unit or set is separated into 100 
parts. When the terms common fraction and decimal

The modern English term fraction was ﬁ rst used by Geoffrey

the meaning “broken number” in Middle English.

fraction are used throughout the school years, chil-
dren learn that both are representations of fractional 
numbers.
Mathematically, 
frac-
tional numbers are part of 
the set of rational numbers 
that can be expressed in 
the form a
b, where a is any 
whole number and b is any 
nonzero whole num ber. 
Symbolically, 
fractional 
numbers are expressed as 
common fractions (1
2 and 
2
3), as decimal fractions 
(0.5 and 0.6666. . .), and as 
percents (50% and 662
3%).
Five situations that give 
rise to common fractions 
are discussed in the fol-
lowing sections.
Five Situations Represented 
by Common Fractions
Unit Partitioned into Equal-Size Parts
Objects such as cakes, pies, and pizzas are frequently 
cut into equal-size parts. When a cake is cut into four 
equal-size parts, each part is one-fourth of the entire 
cake; the common fraction 1
4 represents the size of 
each piece. Many measurements with the English 
system of measurement require common fractions. 
When you need a more precise measurement than 
is possible with a basic unit of measure, such as an 
inch, the object is subdivided into equal-size parts. 
When an inch is subdivided into eight equal-size 
parts, each part is one 
of eight equal-size parts 
made from the whole, or 1
8
of an inch.
The digits in a com-
mon fraction show this 
part-whole relationship. In 
the numeral 1
2, the 2 indi-
cates the number of equal-
size parts into which the 
whole, or unit, has been 
subdivided and is called 
the denominator. The 1 
indicates the number of parts being considered at a 
particular time and is called the numerator (Figure 
13.1a). For the common fraction 3
8, the whole has 8 
equal-size parts, and 3 of the 8 parts are indicated 
(Figure 13.1b). Division of a unit into its parts is also 
referred to as an area or geometric model.

Set Partitioned into Equal-Size Groups
When a collection of objects is partitioned into 
groups of equal size, the setting is clearly one that 
involves division. When 12 objects are divided into 
two equal-size groups, the mathematical sentence 
12  2  6 describes the setting. The child thinks, 
“How many cookies will each person get when a set 
of 12 is divided equally between two people?” The 
whole number 6 represents the amount of one of 
the two parts. A different interpretation of the same 
setting is to ﬁ nd 1
2 of a set of 12 objects, or 1
2 of 12  6. 
The child thinks, “What is 1
2 of a set of 12?” Now the 
whole number 6 refers to 1
2 of the set (Figure 13.2a). 

 
Chapter 13 Developing Understanding of Common and Decimal Fractions 
257
If 3
5 of 15 hamsters are brown, children must think of 
ﬁ rst separating the 15 hamsters into ﬁ ve groups of 
equal size. Each group of 3 hamsters relates to the 
size of the original set of 15 hamsters so that each 
group is 3
15, or 1
5, of the entire set. The denominator 
in 3
5 indicates the number of equal-size parts into 
which the set is subdivided (5), and the numerator 
indicates the number of groups being considered 
(3). If 3
5 of the 15 hamsters are brown, then there are 
9 brown hamsters (Figure 13.2b).
Comparison Model
Fractional relationships can also be represented as 
a comparison between two sets. Figure 13.3 shows 
2
3 using the comparison method. The number of red 
buttons compared to the number of green buttons is 
2
3 (Figure 13.3a), as is the number of red cans com-
pared to the number of green cans (Figure 13.3b). 
For 2 red buttons there are 3 green buttons, and for 
2 red cans there are 3 green cans. In both cases the 
numerator and the denominator are distinct.
In contrast to the part-whole model for fractions, 
the fractional part is not embedded in the whole. 
Counting out or removing the numerator (2 red 
buttons) for examination will not affect the denomi-
nator (3 green buttons), because each part exists 
independently. This method of representing com-
mon fractions parallels the meaning of fraction as 
a ratio.
Expressions of Ratios
The relationship or comparison between two num-
bers is often expressed as a ratio. Although a full 
discussion of ratio and proportion is presented in 
Chapter 15, it is appropriate to brieﬂ y consider the 
concept of ratio here, in contrast to fraction con-
cepts. The following are examples of common situ-
ations that exhibit ratios.
• The relationship between things in two groups. In a 
classroom in which each child has six textbooks, 
the ratio of each child to books is 1 to 6. This can 
be represented by the expression 1 to 6, 1 : 6, or by 
the common fraction numeral 1
6 (Figure 13.4a).
• The relationship between a subset of things and 
the set of which it is a part. When there are 3 blue-
covered books in a set of 10 books, the ratio of 
blue-covered books to all books is 3 to 10, 3 : 10, or 
3
10 (Figure 13.4b).

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
• The relationship between the sizes of two things or 
two sets. When a 10-foot jump rope is compared 
with a 30-foot jump rope, the ratio between the 
two ropes is 10 to 30, 10:30, 10
30, or 1
3. When a set 
of 20 books is compared with a set of 30 books, 
the expressions 20 to 30, 20:30, 20
30, and 2
3 are used 
(Figure 13.4c).
• The relationship between objects and their cost. If 
the price of two cans of cat food is 69 cents, the 
ratio between the cans of cat food and their cost 
is 2 for 69, 2:69, or 2
69 (Figure 13.4d).
• The relationship between the chance of one event 
occurring out of all possible events. When a regu-
lar die (die is singular for the plural dice) is rolled, 
the chance of rolling a 4 can be expressed as 1 in 
6, 1 : 6, or 1
6 (Figure 13.4e).
• Ratio as an operator. In this case the ratio is a 
number that acts on another number. When a toy 
or model is built with a scale of 1
50, the ratio acts 
as an operator between a measurement of the 
model and the actual object (Figure 13.4f). If the 
actual object is 150 feet long, then the model is 
3 feet long (150  1
50  3).
When children simply 
form a ratio between two 
numbers, they will gener-
ally have little difﬁ culty. It 
is when ratios are used in 
contexts that require pro-
portional reasoning that 
difﬁ culty can arise. In such 
settings, the tendency is 
for children to use additive 
reasoning and not multi-
plicative reasoning. See 
Chapter 15 where ratio and 
proportional reasoning is 
discussed more fully.
Indicated Division
Sentences such as 3  4 
 ? and 11  3  ? indi-
cate that division is to be 
performed. Cutting a piece of cloth that is 3 yards 
long into four equal-size pieces illustrates the ﬁ rst 
situation (Figure 13.5). Another way to indicate this 
division is by using the common fraction numeral 
3
4. A setting that illustrates the second sentence is 
the equal sharing of 11 cookies by three children 
(Figure 13.6). Division for the second sentence can 
be expressed as 11
3 . When the division is completed, 
the answer (3 with a remainder of 2) can be repre-
sented as the mixed numeral 32
3, or each child’s fair 
share of the 11 cookies.
The term numerator is derived from the Latin term numeros, 
meaning “number,” and denominator is from the Latin term 
denominaire, meaning “namer.” Thus the denominator names 
the fraction (according to how many parts make up the 
whole), and the numerator indicates the number of individual 
parts. (Bright & Hoffner, 1993)
The ﬁ rst European mathematician to use the familiar fraction 
bar was Leonardo of Pisa (c. 1175– 1250), better known as 
Fibonacci.
 The horizontal fraction bar symbol (3
4) is called an obelus, 
from the Greek word meaning “obelisk.” The diagonal frac-
tion bar symbol (3/4) is called a solidus. The term is derived 
from the Latin term meaning “monetary unit.”

Introducing Common 
Fractions to Children
Primary-grade children typically encounter com-
mon fractions through work with real objects and 
models while learning about simple common frac-
tions such as halves, thirds, and fourths. Small sets 
of objects can also be separated into equal-size 
groups. Early on, common fraction numerals such 
as 1
2 or 1
4 are introduced as names for common frac-
tions, but foundational understanding of fractions 
continues throughout the primary grades. Children 
label parts of wholes or sets as one-half and two-
thirds or refer to one part out of two parts or two parts 
out of three parts. When students do begin to write 
common fraction numerals, they should write their 
fractions with a horizontal bar, not a diagonal one. A 
horizontal fraction bar will make future operations 
with fractions, especially multiplication and divi-
sion, much easier (see Chapter 14). As understand-
ing of the concepts of common fractions for parts 
of units and parts of groups becomes established, 
children will be able to work with other common 
fractions (ﬁ fths, sixths, eighths, and tenths) and will 
learn to recognize and name the parts of numerals 
such as 3
5, 2
6, and 3
8. When children use realistic set-
tings, stories, and models of common fractions, they 
recognize that a given common fraction, such as 
1
2, has many equivalent common fractions, such as 2
4, 
3
6, and 4
8. The following photo shows typical commer-
cial models for elementary school children. Many 
teachers have children use paper circles, squares, 
rectangles, and triangles and drawings when com-
mercial materials are not available.
Partitioning Single Things
Most children have experiences in which they share 
parts of whole objects or collections of objects by 
using fractional parts long before the concept of 
common fractions is introduced in school. They 
help parents and others cut and share pizzas, cook-
ies, sandwiches, and myriad other items. These and 
similar common experiences can be illustrated on a 
bulletin board to form a basis for discussing the pro-
cess of cutting things into parts and sharing pieces 
(Figure 13.7).
Squares, rectangles, circles, and other shapes 
cut from paper can extend real-life experiences dur-
ing introductory activities. Activity 13.1 shows one 
Research for the Classroom
•
An interesting research ﬁ nding involves the difference 
between representing a common fraction with a set of dis-
crete objects and representing it with a continuous object. 
Hunting (1999) found that young children can represent 
a common fraction of a set of marbles by setting aside 
some of the marbles, as for example, setting aside two 
out of a set of six marbles to represent 1
3 of the set. The 
same children had great difﬁ culty marking 1
3 of a rectangle 
or separating 1
3 of a licorice stick. Many children could not 
represent any common fractions at all with continuous 
objects. Thus, although children may appear to have a 
good understanding of fraction representation when using 
discrete objects, they may require more experience with 
common fractions before they can represent common frac-
tions with continuous objects such as a number line.

Antonio y Oliveres, a Spanish mathematician writing in 
Mexico in the mid 1800s, ﬁ rst began the use of the solidus 
(/) to represent fractions. The solidus is a popular alternative 
to the common fraction bar because it allows printers to set 
type for fractions on a single line.

is my ﬁ nger touching?” (Answer: 1.) Write 1
4 on the 
chalkboard. Repeat a similar dialogue with 1
3, 1
2, and 
other familiar fractions. Help children recognize that 
the bottom numeral indicates the number of parts 
into which the unit has been cut and that the top nu-
meral indicates one of the parts. Children typically 
refer to the numerator as the “top number” and the 
denominator as the “bottom number.”
Accept Their Language in Early Work. Insisting 
that primary school children use the terms numera-
tor and denominator may serve only to complicate 
their understanding of fractions. As children mature 
and meanings become established, introduce the 
terms denominator and numerator to identify the 
two parts of a common fraction.
As work advances, children need activities that 
extend beyond unit fractions. A unit fraction is one 
in which the numerator is 1. Activities similar to Ac-
tivity 13.1 should be used to develop understanding 
of fractions with numerators other than 1, such as 2
3, 
2
4, and 3
4. (See Black-Line Masters 13.1, 13.2, and 13.3 
for fraction circle and fraction strips templates.) See 
“Quarters, Quarts, and More Quarters: A Fraction 
Unit” on the companion website for an example of 
a fraction unit that introduces simple common and 
decimal fractions.

Assessing Knowledge 
of Common Fractions
A quick way to assess children’s understanding that 
common fractions represent fair-share, or equiva-
lent, parts of a whole is by using shapes that show 
both examples and nonexamples of the fractions. 
Prepare some shapes that have shading showing 
halves, thirds, or fourths and other shapes show -
ing nonexamples of halves, thirds, or fourths (Fig -
ure 13.10). You can gain a good idea of a child’s un-
derstanding by placing the shapes in an array and 
directing the child, “Point to each shape that shows 
1
4, 1
2, 1

Figure 13.9 Squares marked to show where to fold to

Folding a shape to show three equivalent parts 
is difﬁ cult, so fold lines should be marked to show 
how to fold the shape during early experiences. 
When the idea of fair shares is well understood and 
the idea of cutting regions into equivalent pieces is 
clear, numerals for common fractions can be intro-
duced. You might begin with a shape cut into four 
equivalent pieces: “Into how many parts has this 

thirds, and fourths, verify the understanding by ask-
ing, “Are there any other fourths (halves, thirds) 
shown on the shapes?” A child who is certain will 
say no. Table 13.2 provides a scoring rubric for this 
assessment. In Activity 13.2 children fold an equilat-
eral triangle into smaller shapes and compare the 
area of each resulting part to the whole area of the 
original triangle. In Activity 13.3 children use Cui-
senaire rods to explore part-whole relationships of 
common fractions.
ACTIVITY 13.1
 
Introducing Halves (Representation)
Level: Kindergarten and Grade 1
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students develop the concept of one-half.
Materials: Large circles, squares, and rectangles cut from news-
print or colored construction paper
•  If space permits, have children sit on the ﬂ oor in a semi-
circle, with you at the opening (they can work at their 
tables or desks, if necessary).
•  Nearly all young children have experiences with “fair 
share” settings. Asking children to tell of their experiences 
will elicit comments that reveal the extent of their knowl-
edge of the concept of sharing things.
•  Give each child one of the shapes cut from newsprint or 
colored construction paper. Ask them to name a type of 
food each shape might represent (e.g., circle: pizza, torti-
lla, cake, pie, cookie; square: brownie, wafﬂ e; rectangle: 
cake, lasagna, candy bar). Tell them that they are to fold 
each shape so that there are two fair-share parts. Chal-
lenge them to see if a shape can be folded in more than 
one way to form two fair shares.
•  Use the folded shapes to develop new knowledge. Have 
children discuss and show their fair shares. Be sure that 
children with unique folds have opportunities to show 
and explain their work. It is easy to see that two parts are 
the same size when a rectangle is folded along a center 
line so the opposite edges come together. It is more dif-
ﬁ cult to see that pieces are the same size when a fold is 
made along a diagonal or in some other way. It may be 
necessary to cut along a fold line so that one piece can 
be ﬂ ipped or rotated to make it ﬁ t atop the second piece. 
Help children see that even though a circle can be folded 
many times to show halves, the fold is always made in the 
same way.
•  Develop understanding of the children’s knowledge by 
saying, “Raise your left thumb if you can tell me what we 
call each part when we make two fair-share parts” (An-
swer: one-half.) Discuss the meaning of one-half.
•  Reﬂ ect on their knowledge by asking children to name 
times when they have used one-half. They might discuss 
such things as 1
2 of an hour, an apple, a candy bar, or a 
soft drink.

Cuisenaire Fractions
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Student pairs
Objective: Students look to identify different Cuisenaire rods as 
fractional parts of longer rods.
Materials: Full set of Cuisenaire rods (10 white rods, 5 of each 
other color) for each pair of students; overhead set of Cuisenaire 
rods
•  Display teal, green, red, and white rods on the overhead.
•  Ask students to speculate about which color rod is exactly 
half the length of the teal rod.
•  Once students have a chance to give their thoughts, 
discuss how to be sure which rod is actually half. Probe for 
using two same-color rods to line up with the teal rod for 
an exact ﬁ t. Because two green rods are the same length 
as a single teal rod, each green rod represents half the teal 
rod (1
2t  g, where t represents the length of the teal rod 
and g represents the length of the green rod).
•  Speculate aloud about whether there are other combina-
tions of same-color rods that are the same length as the 
teal rod. Have students explore this possibility with their 
partners, using their Cuisenaire rods. Children should ﬁ nd 
that six white or three red rods are the same length as the 
teal rod.
•  Suggest to students that there are rods that have equal-
length same-color combinations. Their task is to search for 
them and record their ﬁ ndings by making sketches of their 
rods and writing out the fractions shown by the shorter 
rods.
•  Post the results on the board. Once all students’ ﬁ ndings 
are posted, ask if students notice anything missing. The 
red, black, green, and yellow rods have no same-color 
combinations except white that match their lengths. As 
it turns out, these are prime numbers. Although you may 
not be ready to introduce such a concept or the vocabu-
lary, simply noting the fact that some lengths or numbers 
cannot be divided up evenly into part-whole pieces (ex-
cept for unit pieces) will lay the foundation for later work 
with prime and composite numbers.

had already developed their foundational concep-
tions of fractions and part-whole relationships. A 
manipulative called the fraction wheel is the focus 
in Activity 13.4. When students use two pieces to 
model common fractions, they can manipulate and 
even remove the part without affecting the whole. 
The companion website activity “Mystery Fraction 
Pieces” uses a circle to build children’s foundational 
understanding of part-whole relationships. Fraction 
stencils shown in the photo allow children to make 
their own fraction representations. The companion 
website activity “Tangram Fractions” explores frac-

ACTIVITY 13.4
 
The Fraction Wheel
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students develop their ability to identify common frac-
tions in an area model.
Materials: An angle wheel (see Black-Line Masters 13.5 and 13.6)
•  Draw a circle on the board with 1
4 shaded. Ask a student 
volunteer to explain how much of the circle is shaded.
•  Draw a second circle on the board, this time with 2
3 
shaded. Again ask a student volunteer to explain how 
much of the circle is shaded.
•  Show the angle wheel with 1
4 shaded. Ask a volunteer to 
explain how much of the shaded part is showing. Be sure 
that all the children understand that the shaded part of 
the angle wheel shows part-whole fractions, then have a 
second student explain why the correct answer matches 
the shaded part showing on the fraction wheel. Use only 
unit fractions at ﬁ rst so that all the shaded portions are 
less than half of the circle.
•  Quickly show a different angle, and call on a student to 
give the part-whole fraction that the shading represents. 
If the answer is incorrect, quickly move to another student 
for another answer.
•  Continue until a student gives the correct answer, and 
then have another student explain why the correct answer 
matches the shaded part showing on the fraction wheel. 
•  Show several unit fractions to the class (1
2, 1
3, 1
4, 1
5, 1
6, and 1
8), 
and repeat the unit fractions as needed, so that each child 
has an opportunity to give an answer and/or explain an 
answer.
•  Once all the children have had an opportunity to give or 
explain at least one answer, show a common fraction 
between 1
2 and 1, such as 2
3. When you display 2
3, ask the 
children how this new fraction is different from all the 
preceding fractions. Probe for the concept that this frac-
tion is greater than 1
2. That means that no unit fractions 
can be represented by shading that is greater than 1
2 the 
circle. Show several fractions greater than 1
2 (3
4, 2
3, 5
6, 7
8, . . .) 
following the same procedure with the wheel as before.
•  As students explain answers, probe for the half-circle as 
a benchmark to help determine the value of the common 
fraction.
•  Now display any of the preceding fractions on the angle 
wheel, mixing all the common fractions used to this point. 
The goal of the activity is to move quickly from one stu-
dent to another as they give estimates of the part-whole 
fraction you display on the angle wheel. Although it is 
not critical that students be able to discriminate 1
6 from 1
8, 
the ﬁ rst few times you work with the angle wheel, all the 
children should be able to use 1
2 (and possibly 1
4 and 3
4) as a 
benchmark to help them make a reasonable estimate of 
the part-whole fraction that the angle wheel displays.

fractions. A vignette on the website illustrates how 
California teacher Dee Uyeda had her third-graders 
work in cooperative groups to further their under-
standing of fractions.
Partitioning Sets of Objects
The concept of a fractional part of a set should be 
introduced only after children demonstrate that 
they can conserve numbers, have a good grasp of 
whole numbers, and are skillful in counting objects 
in sets. Activity 13.5 provides a real-world setting for 
dealing with fractional parts of groups. Later, chil-
dren should be able to partition sets into equal-size 
groups without using fractional regions or markers 
as cues. As they work, children notice that not every 
set can be separated into equal parts with a whole-
number answer for each part. This realization sets 
the stage for understanding mixed numerals and 
common fractions greater than 1.
Fractional Numbers Greater than 1
Many students seem to believe that all fractions are 
between 0 and 1. This is why students need opportu-
nities to deal with common fractions greater than 1, 
such as 6
3, 3
2, and 9
4. Pictures cut from magazines can 
be used to present real-world settings for introduc-
ing these numerals. Later, paper shapes and num-
ber lines can be used as representations of com-
mon fractions. The pizza problem discussed earlier 
provides a real-world setting for looking at common 
fractions with numerators greater than denomina-
tors. Children see that if the family of three gets one 
pizza, the family of six must have two pizzas to have 
the same amount of pizza per person. When one 
pizza is cut into three equal-size parts, the common 
fraction is 3
3. When two pizzas are each cut into three 
equal-size pieces, the common fraction is 6
3. When 
two pies are each cut into six equal-size pieces, 
the common fraction is 12
6 . When two and one-half 
cakes are cut into six equal-size parts, the common 
fraction is 15
6 . Figure 13.14 illustrates each of these 
common fractions modeled with pictures of popu-
lar food items. Common fractions with numerators 
greater than the denominator have traditionally been 
called improper fractions. But it is more meaningful 
to children to call them common fractions that are 
greater, or larger, than 1. Fractional numbers greater 
than 1 are sometimes converted to whole numbers 
MISCONCEPTION
When children use manipulatives to model part-whole relation-
ship of fractions, they may use an area model (see Activity 13.4) 
or a linear model to represent fractions. However, when children 
are beginning to formulate fractions from either model, they may 
form several different fractions from the same setting. Note the 
Uniﬁ x cube train in Figure 13.12. A student trying to write what 
fraction of the train is blue may write 2
3 and not 2
5. Do you see why?
 
The child is comparing the part of the train that is blue (2) to 
the remaining part of the train that is green (3) instead of to the 
entire length of the train (5). The child sees a part-part relation-
ship and not a part-whole relationship. One reason this happens 
is that young children remove the blue cubes from the train and 
then try to make sense of what remains. With the area and linear 
models for part-whole relationships, once the numerator pieces 
are removed, there is no longer any whole to use as a reference. 
The whole no longer exists as a model.
 
Students can make a similar error with the array shown in 
Figure 13.13. The fraction that represents the part-whole relation-
ship for green squares is 3
8, but children who are just beginning to 
express fractions might render it as a part-part relationship, or 
3
5. It is important to help children in these early stages to be sure 
they do not develop such misunderstandings, which can become 
difﬁ cult to break, and thus hold back their advancement in laying 
a foundation for fraction concepts.

or to a combination of a whole number and a com-
mon fraction. The term mixed numeral refers to a 
combination of a whole number and a fractional 
number. When 13 cookies are divided fairly among 
four people, the common fraction 13
4  can be used 
to represent the result. This is an indicated division 
interpretation of a common fraction. Twelve cookies 
are divided into four groups of three cookies each, 
and the remaining cookie is cut into four equal-size 
parts. Each person gets three whole cookies and 1
4 of 
another, or 31
4 cookies. The number 31
4 is read “three 
and one-fourth.” This is because a mixed number is 
composed of a whole number (3) and a common 
fraction (1
4). When students read mixed numbers, 
call their attention to the word and in the number 
name. Have children explain why the word and is 
critical in understanding the mixed number they are 
reading. One last aspect of common fraction value 
is worth mentioning here, in the form of a question:

The Fruit Dealer and His Apples (Communication)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Cooperative learning
Objective: Students demonstrate strategies for ﬁ nding nonunit 
parts of a collection of objects.
Materials: Green or yellow plastic beads or disks; small pieces of 
paper to represent bags
•  Organize children for a pairs/check cooperative-learning 
experience.
•  The activity develops as children use beads or disks to 
represent apples. Present this story: “A fruit dealer has 36 
Granny Smith apples. He wants to put his apples in bags 
with an equal number of apples in each bag. How many 
different ways can he bag the apples so that each bag 
contains the same number of apples?”
•  One student in each pair groups the apples without con-
sulting the partner. When the student is ﬁ nished, the part-
ner accepts or rejects the way the apples were grouped. 
A written record of the grouping is made. The students 
alternate making groupings until they agree that all pos-
sible groupings have been made and they have recorded 
all the groupings. Pair by pair, ask children to report on 
one way they separated the apples. Some pairs may have 
only two or three groupings; others may have all possible 
groupings. As each pair reports, ask, “What part of 36 
apples is each of your two groups? three groups? four 
groups?” and so on. List groupings and fractional parts on 
the chalkboard: 2 apples are 1
18 of 36, 3 apples are 1
12 of 
36, and so on.
•  Have children use the information on the chalkboard to 
deal with nonunit common fractions: “If you buy two 
bags that each contain 6 apples, what part of the 36 
apples do you have?” Continue with other fractional parts 
of 36, such as 3
4, 2
3, and 5
6. (Children’s level of understand-
ing of and ability to solve earlier problems will determine 
how many problems you present.)
•  Discussion following each question enables children to 
reﬂ ect on their learning by conﬁ rming the accuracy of 
their work.

3? Are you sure? Consider this conversation 
between two fourth-graders, who are comparing the 
two fraction pieces shown in Figure 13.15.
Denyse: I still say one-half has to be bigger than 
one-third. Remember that the more pieces you 
need to make a whole, the smaller each piece is.
Alexa: I know, but look at this piece. It’s 1
3, but it’s a 
lot bigger than this piece (1
2).
Denyse: You’re right. It is bigger. Hmm. Maybe it’s 
if the bottom number is bigger, then the fraction is 
bigger.
Alexa: But that’s not what we did yesterday.
Denyse: I know, but look at the two pieces. One-
third is bigger than one-half.
Alexa: I know. That’s what I said.
As you can see 
in 
Figure 
13.15, 
the 1
3 piece is cer-
tainly larger than 
the 1
2 piece. What 
is confusing these 
students? They are 
comparing 
frac-
tional pieces from 
two 
different-size 
wholes. The 1
3 piece 
is from a larger 
circle than is the 1
2
piece. The 1
3 piece is 
larger than the 1
2 piece in the same sense that 1
3 of 300 
(100) is larger than 1
2 of 100 (50). Many students have 
this misconception because common fraction com-
parisons are done with abstract number representa-
tions, devoid of context. Although using numerical 
expressions out of context is not inappropriate and 
is, in fact, useful for practicing many mathematical 
operations, it is still important to stress that all com-
mon fractions must be based on the same whole set 
in order to be compared.
Activity 13.6 is an Internet activity that uses vir-
tual manipulatives as area models of fractions to ex-
plore fractional numbers greater than 1.
Introducing Decimal Fractions
Decimal fractions are used to ﬁ nd parts of units and 
of collections of objects, just as common fractions 
are. The difference between the two fractional num-
bers is that the denominator of a common fraction 
can be any whole number except 0, whereas deci-
mal fractions are conﬁ ned to tenths, hundredths, 
and other powers of 10.
Teaching children about decimal fractions along 
with the study of common fractions is an integral 
part of the mathematics curriculum in the primary 
grades. The goal in the early grades is to lay a foun-
dation that enables older students to avoid miscon-
ceptions and procedural difﬁ culties. Children who 
investigate the meaning of decimal fractions and 
learn about them through activities with models will 
have the understanding needed for more advanced 
concepts and uses in later grades. An understand-
ing of decimal fractions and their relationship with 
common fractions develops gradually, so work with 
physical materials, diagrams, and real-world settings 
is extended over a period of years.
Children’s understanding of whole numbers and 
common fractions forms the basis for their under-
standing of decimal fractions. Real-world examples 
of things separated into tenths and hundredths are

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
less common than are examples of common frac-
tions. Metric units of measure, such as a meter stick, 
can represent decimal fractions, as does our mon-
etary system. White and orange Cuisenaire rods 
also display a decimal relationship. Commercial or 
student-made materials are needed for individual 
and group activities. Any commercial base-10 prod-
uct can serve as a model to represent decimal frac-
tions. When base-10 materials are used, a large ﬂ at 
becomes a unit, a rod a one-tenth piece, and a small 
cube a one-hundredth piece.
A zero after the decimal point, as in 1.0, also has 
meaning. In 1.0 it indicates that a unit has been sepa-
rated into 10 parts and that all 10 parts are being 
considered; it is equivalent to the common fraction 
10
10, and the zero should not be omitted. The decimal 
point also indicates precision of measurement, in-
dicating that 3.0 meters, for example, is accurate to 
the nearest tenth, in contrast to 3 meters, which may 
have been rounded to the nearest meter.
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
Any activities that use money can use currency and coins 
from the native countries of minority students.

Figure 13.16 A meter stick and Cuisenaire rods used to
show tenths
Activity 13.7 illustrates an introductory lesson us-
ing Cuisenaire rods. Construction paper can replace 
the rods in this lesson. In Activity 13.8 a strip of pa-
per with units separated into 10 equal-size parts is 
used to extend decimal fractions beyond 1. In Activ-
ity 13.9 a decimal fraction number line is used.
When commercial materials are unavailable, col-
ored construction paper with half-inch or centime-
ter squares can be laminated and cut to make an 
activities kit. Each child might make a kit consisting 
of 10 square mats that are 10 units along each side, 
20 strips that are 1 unit wide and 10 units long, and 
150 one-unit squares.
Introducing Tenths
Activities involving different materials help children 
acquire a well-developed understanding of tenths 
and decimal notation for tenths. When children 
learn to write whole numbers, a decimal point is 
not part of the number. It is not needed because the 
whole number represents one or more whole units. 
Decimal numbers indicate that parts of units are 
involved. The decimal point separates the whole-
number part of a numeral from the fractional part of 
a numeral. When only a decimal part of a numeral 
is written, it is common practice to write a zero in 
the ones place of the numeral, as in 0.3. The zero 
helps make it clear that the numeral indicates a 
decimal fraction. When no zero is written, it is pos-
sible to overlook the decimal point and misread the 
numeral.
Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin (1542– 1620) ﬁ rst used 
decimal fractions in his book La Thiende. When he wrote 
common decimals, Stevin used a small circle instead of a 
decimal point. The word dime is derived from the title of the 
French translation of his book, La Disme.
Introducing Hundredths
Children’s understanding of the decimal fraction 
representation of hundredths is developed through 
extension of activities with tenths. The hundredth 
pieces are included in kits for the new activities. An 
introductory lesson is shown in Activity 13.10. An ac-
tivity built around Cuisenaire rods and a meter stick 
is useful for helping students to understand tenths 
and hundredths and to show how decimal fractions 
are used to indicate parts of a meter. Let children 
work in groups of three or four. Each group has a 
meter stick, 10 orange rods, and 100 small cubes. 
First, the children align the 10 rods end to end along-
side the meter stick (Figure 13.16).

ACTIVITY 13.7
 
Introducing Tenths
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students are able to explain the meaning of decimal 
tenths.
Materials: Cuisenaire ﬂ ats, orange rods (construction paper may 
be used instead)
•  When they are used with whole numbers, a large ﬂ at in a 
Cuisenaire set is considered to be 100, an orange rod 10, 
and a white cube 1. Tell the children that for this lesson, 
each ﬂ at represents one unit, or 1.
•  Tell each child to cover a ﬂ at with orange rods.
•  Ask, “How many rods does it take to cover the unit 
piece?” Verify with the children that there are 10. Ask, 
“What part of the unit piece is covered by one rod?” 
Verify that it is 1 of 10, or 1
10. Write 1
10 on the chalkboard.
•  Ask volunteers to give names for two rods or strips (2 of 
10, or 2
10), three rods or strips (3 of 10, or 3
10), and so on, 
until 9
10 is reached and all common fractions have been 
written on the chalkboard.
•  Introduce the decimal notation 0.1, and write it next to 
the 1
10. Tell the children that both numerals are read as 
“one-tenth.” Select students to write decimal fractions for 
each of the other common fractions.
•  Tell the students that 1.0 is the numeral to use when all 
10 parts are being considered. The decimal point and zero 
indicate that the unit has been cut into 10 parts and that 
all 10 parts are being considered.
•  Use money to help children understand how a dime 
shows one-tenth of a dollar. Display a dollar bill and ask, 
“What coin is one-tenth of a dollar?” (Answer: dime.) 
“What two ways can we write the value of a dime?” 
(Answer: 10 cents or $0.10.) Ask, “Three dimes are what 
part of a dollar?” (Answer: 3
10.) “What two ways can you 
write 30 cents?” Repeat with other numbers of dimes. 
(Note: Do not use either a nickel or a quarter during these 
early decimal fraction activities. Neither coin supports the 
base-10 aspect of common decimals.)
•  Summarize the lesson by pointing out that the common 
fractions and the decimal fractions are both ways to des-
ignate the same quantity.

ACTIVITY 13.8
 
Fraction-Strip Tenths
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Cooperative learning
Objective: Students are introduced to mixed decimals and money 
as an application of decimal fractions.
Materials: One 3-unit-long fraction strip for each pair of children; a 
die for each pair; plastic dimes or dime-stamped squares of paper
•  Organize the children as partner pairs. Give each pair a 
fraction strip, a die, and replica dimes.
0.1
1
0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1
•  Present these instructions: You will take turns to roll your 
die four times. After each roll, the partner not rolling the 
die covers the strip, one square at a time, with enough 
dimes to equal the number showing on the die for that 
roll. When you have ﬁ nished the four rolls, write numbers 
with a dollar sign to show the total value of the dimes on 
your strip.
•  When all have completed their rolls, call for attention, 
then write the words “low,” “middle,” and “high” on the 
chalkboard. In their pairs, students decide whether they 
have a low, middle, or high amount of money and then 
tell in which column to place their money. Write the dollar 
values beneath the words.
•  Have students remove the dimes and mark an X in place 
of each one, then write the decimal numeral that indicates 
the number of tenths covered by X’s. Write the decimal 
numerals alongside the corresponding dollar amounts, 
and compare the two numerals. (The difference will be 
the dollar sign and a zero in the hundredths place in each 
money numeral.)
•  This lesson presents a good opportunity to discuss ideas 
related to the probability of events occurring (see Chapter 
20). For example, you can discuss the smallest number of 
squares (4) and the highest number of squares (24) that 
could be covered. “What would have to occur if only 
four squares were covered?” (Answer: Four 1’s would 
be rolled.) “If 24 squares were covered?” (Answer: Four 
6’s would be rolled.) “Did this happen with any of you?” 
“Why are there more numbers in the middle column than 
in the low or the high column?” (Answer: The likelihood 
of getting four 1’s or four 6’s is much less than that of 
getting a mixture of numbers. A mixture of numbers will 
be closer to the middle.)

ACTIVITY 13.9
 
Number-Line Decimals
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Cooperative learning
Objective: Students are introduced to a decimal fraction number 
line and lay a foundation for adding and subtracting decimal 
fractions.
Materials: Duplicated copies of decimal numbers lines with tenths 
to 3.0, pencils, paper
•  Organize children in pairs for a send-a-problem activity. 
Each pair has a duplicated copy of the number line, two 
pieces of paper, and a pencil. Each pair is to write four 
questions of the following type: Where do you stop when 
you start at 0 and go seven steps along the line? Where 
do you stop when you start at 0.4 and move eight steps 
to the right? Where do you stop if you start at 1.7 and 
move three steps to the left? Pairs write their questions on 
one paper and their answers on the second paper.
•  Each pair exchanges papers with the other pair on its 
team and answers the questions. When all questions are 
completed, students meet in groups of four to check their 
answers.
•  Students take turns reading the decimal numerals for their 
answers. Each group is to resolve any situations in which 
there are discrepant answers.

Introducing Hundredths
Level: Grades 3 and 4
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students demonstrate understanding of the concept of 
decimal hundredths.
Materials: Cuisenaire ﬂ ats, orange rods, and white cubes (con-
struction paper can be used); cards containing numbers between 
0 and 1, such as 0.01, 0.23, 0.40, 0.57, 0.99 (a different number 
on each card, one for each child)
•  Review prior knowledge by having each student display a 
ﬂ at; then cover it with orange rods. Review the notation 
for decimal tenths.
•  Instruct the children to remove one tenths piece from the 
ﬂ at and cover it with white cubes. Ask, “How many white 
cubes cover one tenths piece?” (Answer: 10.) “What part 
of a tenth is one white cube?” (Answer: 1
10.) Ask, “If it 
takes 10 white cubes to cover one orange rod, how many 
will it take to cover all 10 rods?” (Answer: 100.)
•  Discuss the fact that 100 white cubes will cover the ﬂ at.
•  Ask, “What part of a ﬂ at is one white cube?” (Answer: 
1
100.) Introduce the decimal notation 0.01. Ask, “How 
does this notation differ from the notation 0.1?” Help 
children understand that the two numerals to the right of 
the decimal point represent hundredths; in this case, it is 
one-hundredth.
•  Present other decimal fractions for children to represent 
with the Cuisenaire materials: 0.15, 0.36, 0.86, 0.40.
•  Use money as a way to extend understanding of hun-
dredths. Ask, “What part of a dollar is one penny?” (An-
swer: 1
100.) “What are two ways we can use money nota-
tion to show one cent?” (Answer: 1 cent and $0.01.) Have 
the children write notations to show money amounts such 
as 24 cents, 50 cents, 97 cents, 8 cents.
Variation
•  Use a line-up cooperative-learning activity to extend 
children’s thinking about decimal hundredths.
•  Give each student a card containing a decimal number 
with hundredths.
•  At a signal, the children form a line that puts the numbers 
in order from smallest to largest.
•  When the order is correct, each student turns to the one 
on either side and says, “My number is _____. It is larger/
smaller than your number.”

ACTIVITY 13.11
 
Decimal Fractions on a Calculator (Reasoning and Proof)
Level: Grades 2 and 3
Setting: Pairs of students
Objective: Students use a calculator to develop an understanding 
of magnitude with decimal fractions.
Materials: Student calculators
The calculator provides the opportunity for students to 
explore decimal fractions before they are able to use 
any common algorithms for operations using decimal 
fractions.
•  Pass out a calculator to each student pair.
•  Ask students to enter 0.1 into the calculator. Allow time 
for students to locate the decimal point button.
•  Most calculators will display 0.1 even if students enter 
“.1”. Explain that the 0 is used to emphasize that the 
decimal fraction is less than 1. Remind students to enter 
all subsequent decimal fractions less than 1 with the lead-
ing 0.
•  Once all students have successfully entered 0.1 into their 
calculators, have them clear the entry and this time enter 
0.1  0.1 . All should have 0.2 on their display.
•  Now ask students to press the  key again. This should 
add 0.1 to the display of 0.2 for a new display of 0.3.
•  Have students continue to press 
the  key until the display reads 
0.9, then ask student pairs to 
predict the display when they 
press  the next time. Discuss 
students’ conjectures as a class.
•  Allow students to press the  
key to obtain 1.0. Ask student 
volunteers to explain the result. 
Have students continue to press 
the  key until they reach 1.9.

•  Have students repeat using 0.2, 
0.3, and 0.4 in place of 0.1 in 
their initial number sentence.

play will read as they press the 

tion by using the calculator.

Discuss that there are 10 rods and that their ends 
are at points along the meter stick that indicate 
decimeters. Next, the children align the 100 small 
cubes side by side along the orange rods. Build on 
knowledge of the relationship of the cubes to rods 
to enable children to see that there are 100 small 
cubes and that each one represents one-hundredth 
(0.01) of the meter, or 1 centimeter. An orange rod 
is one-tenth (0.1) of the meter, or 1 decimeter. Ac-
tivity 13.10 expands children’s knowledge of tenths 
and hundredths. Activity 13.11 uses a calculator to 
help children explore the base-10 aspects of deci-
mal fractions.
Introducing Smaller Decimal Fractions
When children learn about decimal fractions 
smaller than hundredths, a large unit region marked 
into 1,000 parts can illustrate thousandths, but it is 
impractical to make models to show 10,000 and 
100,000 parts. Older children who work with num-
bers smaller than thousandths can visualize that 
each thousandth has been cut into 10 equal-size 
parts to make ten-thousandths and then that each 
ten-thousandth has been cut into 10 parts to make 
hundred-thousandths.
Some children may have initial difﬁ culties read-
ing decimal fractions because the name for the 
decimal fraction seems to be off by one. Consider 
0.34. This decimal fraction is read as “thirty-four 
hundredths,” although hundreds in whole numbers 
indicates three digits. Similarly, the decimal frac-
tion 3.456 is read “three and four hundred ﬁ fty-six 
thousandths.” In this case, a three-digit decimal frac-
tion has the label thousandths, which, for children, 
MISCONCEPTION
Some students think that the decimal point marks a symmetri-
cal location in a decimal fraction. Actually, the units position 
in a decimal fraction is the point of symmetry. Can you see 
why?

evokes a four-digit whole number. In the case of 
hundredths the number of hundredths will not ex-
ceed 99; we never reach 100. If there are more than 
99 hundredths, then the result is a mixed number. It 
is good to acknowledge this apparent mismatch be-
tween the number of digits and the decimal fraction 
name as children are learning to read decimal frac-
tions and to help them understand why it is proper.
Comparing Fractional Numbers
Children compare whole numbers in many ways. 
They match objects in one set with objects in a sec-
ond set and conclude that the one with excess ob-
jects has a larger number than the other set. They 
learn that larger numbers are to the right of smaller 
ones on a number line, in numerical sequence, and 
that the difference between any two consecutive 
whole numbers is 1. They need to have similar expe-
riences to learn that fractional numbers can also be 
ordered by size. When children order and compare 
whole numbers, they learn that there is a ﬁ nite num-
ber of whole numbers between any pair of numbers. 
When they order and compare fractional numbers, 
they learn that there is an inﬁ nite number of frac-
tional numbers between any pair of numbers.
Initial experiences comparing common and 
decimal fractions come through investigations with 
models of various kinds. We discuss activities with 
three different models that are appropriate for sec-
ond-, third-, and fourth-graders, followed by more 
abstract procedures suitable for older children.
Comparing Common Fractions
Commercial kits and construction paper can be 
used to model settings in which children compare 
fractions whose numerators are 1. Models show that 
1
2 is more than 1
3, 1
4, or any other unit fraction for an 
object with a given size and shape. The patterns that 
become apparent when models are arranged in se-
quence from smaller to larger or larger to smaller 
help children order these common fractions.
Fraction strips cut from colored construction pa-
per are used in Activity 13.12 to compare common 
fractions. The strips consist of a unit piece and half, 
fourth, third, sixth, eighth, and twelfth pieces. Chil-
dren manipulate the pieces at their desks as they 
complete the activity.
Comparing Common and Decimal 
Fractions with Number Lines
Number lines marked with common fractions pro-
vide a more abstract way to compare fractional 
numbers than do regions or strips. Children extend 
their understanding by connecting their knowledge 
of those models to the more abstract number lines. 
Activity 13.13 provides a setting in which children 
use communication and reasoning skills as they 
compare common fractions on number lines.
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
Newspapers and magazines are good sources for dem-
onstrations of decimal fractions. Sports magazines, such 
as Sports Illustrated and Sports Illustrated for Kids, and 
newspaper sports sections contain many team and individual 
statistics from other countries and from the Olympics and 
World Cup soccer competitions. Monetary exchange rates 
are also represented as decimal fractions. Students can ﬁ nd 
examples and display them on a bulletin board or in a class 
book. Children can also record in their journals examples of 
decimal fractions observed at home and other places outside 
the classroom.
Introducing Mixed Numerals 
with Decimal Fractions
Whole numbers and decimal fractions form mixed 
numerals in the same ways that whole numbers and 
common fractions do. Measurements made with 
meter sticks often result in whole meters plus deci-
meters or centimeters. The measure of the length of 
a room might be recorded as 4.3 meters. This means 
that the room is 4 meters plus 3 decimeters long. 
When children record measurements made with a 
meter stick, explain that people read mixed numer-
als that contain decimal fractions in two ways. Al-
though a measurement of 4.3 meters is commonly 
read as “four point three meters” rather than “four 
and three-tenths meters,” the ﬁ rst reading hides the 
meaning of the number. As children begin to read 
decimal fractions, avoid the common reading “four 
point three.” When children read decimals by sim-
ply reading numerals and inserting “point” where 
the decimal appears, they mask the mathematical 
value of the decimal fraction. The decimal fraction 
2.4 is properly read as “two and four-tenths,” and 
5.35 is read “ﬁ ve and thirty-ﬁ ve hundredths.” Read-
ing mixed numerals with a decimal fraction in this 
manner helps children build an understanding of the 
decimal fraction included with the whole number.

 
Chapter 13 Developing Understanding of Common and Decimal Fractions 
273
Children can also use a set of number lines to 
compare decimal fractions. Display three number 
lines on a large sheet of paper or overhead trans-
parency—one showing a unit, one showing tenths, 
and one showing hundredths—placed one above 
the other so that the starting points are in a verti-
cal line (Figure 13.17). You can provide leads simi-
lar to those in Activity 13.14 to focus attention on 
comparisons:
•  Which is more, 3 tenths or 27 hundredths?
•  Name a number of tenths that is more than 80 
hundredths.
•  What is the number of tenths that is equal to 70 
hundredths?
•  Which is more, 89 hundredths or 9 tenths?
An important concept about numbers—that there is 
no smallest fractional number—can be developed 
intuitively by using number lines like the ones in Ac-
tivity 13.16 and Figure 13.17. In the following vignette 
a fourth-grade teacher uses both common fraction

Fraction Strips (Representation)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Cooperative learning
Objective: Students demonstrate a strategy for comparing com-
mon fractions.
Materials: Multiple sets of fraction strips cut from colored con-
struction paper, four different colored marking pens, large sheets 
of butcher paper, masking tape, paper containing eight questions 
similar to the following:
1.  How many 1
2 strips are as long as the 1 strip? How 
many 1
3 strips are as long as the 1 strip? Which is lon-
ger, a 1
2 strip or a 1
3 strip?
2.  What is the shortest fraction strip in this set? Name 
the strips that are longer than this strip. Use the frac-
tion strips to put these common fractions in order, 
beginning with the largest and ending with the small-
est: 1
8, 1
2, 1
3, 1
6, 1
4.
3.  Which is longer, two 1
2 strips or two 1
3 strips?
4.  Which is longer, two 1
6 strips or one 1
4 strip?
5.  Which is shorter, two 1
3 strips or two 1
8 strips?
6.  Use the strips to put these common fractions in order, 
beginning with the smallest and ending with the larg-
est: 2

•  Put a set of strips, four marking pens, and a question 
sheet together in a food storage bag for each team. Roll 
a sheet of butcher paper for each team and secure with a 
rubber band.
•  Organize the children into team-project cooperative-
learning groups consisting of four children. Distribute one 
bag of materials and a sheet of butcher paper to each 
team.
•  Team members rotate responsibilities as they answer the 
eight questions. Each member is to use the strip material, 
if necessary, to complete two questions while the other 
three serve as consultants. Answers are written on the 
butcher paper, with each student using a different colored 
pen.
•  Tape the answer sheets side by side on the chalkboard or 
a wall. Students check from their desks to see if there are 
any discrepancies in answers. Discuss any discrepancies.

Common Fractions on a Number Line (Communication)
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students order and compare common fractions.
Materials: Large sheet of paper showing number lines with only 
whole-number locations marked, black marking pen, paper and 
pencil for each student. The lines and marks must be visible to 
all students; the set of lines can be displayed on an overhead 
projector.
•  Direct students’ attention to the top line, and point out 
the unit segment.
•  Go to the second line, and mark the point midway be-
tween 0 and 1. Darken and label the marks that show the 
1
2 and 2
2 points on the line.
•  Say, “Raise your right hand if you can tell me the denomi-
nator for common fractions on the third line.” Darken and 
label points for 1
4, 2
4, 3
4, 4

•  Continue to the bottom line, where thirty-seconds will be 
marked and labeled.
•  Raise and discuss questions such as these:
 1.  How many of the 1
2 segments match the length of 
the unit segment?
 2.  What is the shortest segment on the chart?
 3.  How many of the 1
16 segments are equivalent to a 
1
8 segment?
 4.  Which is longer, a 1
16 segment or a 1
4 segment?
 5.  Which are shorter, two 1
8 segments or two 1
4 
segments?
 6.  What number of 1
8 segments are equivalent to a 1
2 
segment? to a 1

•  Use questions like these to help children 
develop generalizations about common 
fractions: “What do you see about com-
mon fractions that are close to 1 on the 
number line?” (Answer: Their top numbers 
[numerators] are almost as large as their 
bottom numbers [denominators].) “What 
can you tell me about common fractions 
that are close to 1
2 on the number line?” 
(Answer: Their top numbers [numerators] 
are about half as big as their bottom num-
bers [denominators].) “Common fractions 
that are close to 0 can be recognized in 
what way?” (Answer: They have a small top 
number [numerator] and a large bottom 
number [denominator].)

and decimal fraction number lines to conduct a dis-
covery lesson designed to elicit children’s thoughts 
about numbers and inﬁ nity.
Teacher: I started at 1
2, which is midway between 
0 and 1. Then I marked the midpoint between 0 and 
1
2. What point is that?
Marcella: It’s 1
4.
Teacher: What is the midpoint between 0 and 1
4?
Ben: It’s 1
8.
Teacher: Yes, it is 1
8. Put your thumbs up if you 
think you know the next point I’ll mark. [Teacher 
looks around to see who is predicting and calls on 
a student.]
Juanita: I think it will be 1
16.
Teacher: Why do you think it will be 1
16?
Juanita: Because 1
16 is a half of 1
8. If you had 2
16 you 
would have the same as 1
8.
The teacher marks 1
16 and then 1
32 on the last num-
bered line and then asks, “What will be the name of 
the midpoint on the blank number line beneath the 
one that shows thirty-seconds?”
Alf: It will be 1
64.
Teacher: I’ve run out of space for more points on 
these lines. Does that mean there are no fractional 
numbers between 1
64 and 0?
Salena: No.
Teacher: How do you know?
Morgan: There has to be a smaller one. It wouldn’t 
make sense for them to just stop.
Lorrie: When I look at the points we’ve marked so 
far, I see a pattern.
Teacher: Explain the pattern you see, Lorrie.
Lorrie: First, we marked 1
2, then 1
4, 1
8, 1
16, 1

Roberto: I get it, the bottom number doubles each 
time.
Liu: The next one will be 1
128.
Teacher: What will the next one be?
Lorrie: It will be 1
256.
Lin: Gee, the fractions are getting mighty small.
Teacher: Let’s leave the common fraction lines 
and look at the decimal fraction lines. The spaces 
between hundredths are too small to separate into 
10 parts. Imagine that we can separate the space 
between zero and one one-hundredth on the num-
ber line into 10 equal-size parts. What would be the 
size of each part?
Carlos: One one-thousandth.
Teacher: Good. So far, we see a pattern of tenths, 
hundredths, thousandths. What is the next decimal 
fraction for this pattern?
Steve: Ten-thousandths.
Teacher: Does this pattern ever end?
Al: No.
Teacher: Can you explain why?
Al: We divided the second number line into 10 
equal-size parts, and the third line into hundredths. 
If the line was bigger, one part of a hundredth line 
could be cut into 10 parts to show thousandths. 
Even though the parts get too small to see and to

Using Benchmarks to Order Fractions
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students develop their ability to order common 
fractions.
Materials: Ruler, paper, pencils
•  Draw a number line on the board like the one shown 
here.
•  Ask for a few common fractions from a student 
volunteer.
•  Discuss where these fractions might be placed. Probe for 
using 1
2 and 1 (and possibly 1
4 and 3

•  Write these common fractions on the board, and direct 
each group to place them on a number line like the one 
drawn on the board: 7

bers to explain how they located it on the number line.

show on the number lines, there is always a smaller 
decimal fraction than the last one we considered.
Teacher: Good explanation. Now, who will summa-
rize what we have discovered about common and 
decimal fractions?
Lakeesha: There is no “smallest” common frac-
tion and no “smallest” decimal fraction. They go on 
forever.
Teacher: Can anyone tell me what we call a se-
quence of numbers that never stops?
Kareem: It’s called inﬁ nity.
Teacher: That’s about right. A sequence of num-
bers that never stops is an inﬁ nite set. There is no 
way to count the numbers. We say that the numbers 
can go on forever, or to inﬁ nity. Now, let’s look at 
one other idea about common and decimal frac-
tions. Do you believe we can count the common 
fractions between 0 and 1?
Josh: I don’t think so, but I’m not sure.
Teacher: Josh is right. Raise your hand if you can 
explain to the class why we can’t count the com-
mon fractions between 0 and 1.
Carlos: We saw that when you marked fractions 
from 1 toward 0 they kept getting smaller but never 
stopped. So, I think that you can never stop stufﬁ ng 
fractions between 0 and 1. If they don’t stop, there 
will be no way to count them.
Teacher: That’s correct. We say that there is an 
inﬁ nite number of common fractions between any 
pair of numbers. Do you think that is true of deci-
mal fractions?
Class: Yes!
Teacher: You are thinking about some powerful 
ideas here. You are learning something about what 
inﬁ nity means.
Different modes of representing numbers are not 
always evident to every child. One important goal 
is to help children connect the different representa-
tions of numbers and make sense of them. A skill-
ful teacher helps children develop the higher-order 
thinking skills needed to participate in discussions 
that expand their thinking beyond the obvious. A 
teacher’s skillful use of models, questions, responses, 
and acceptance will encourage children to expand 
their thinking, as did the children in the vignette.
Discussions of number concepts often lead chil-
dren to continue their investigations beyond 
1
512, 
1
1024, and so on. They may also investigate patterns 
for 1
3, 1
5, or some other unit fraction. Some children 
may be interested in naming and writing the deci-
mal fractions for very small fractional numbers. 
Such children should be encouraged to write their 
numerals and stories about them in their journals or 
learning logs.
Equivalent Fractions
Materials used to help students understand common 
fractions will also help them understand the mean-
ing of equivalent common fractions. Students can 
use identical-size shapes such as fraction circles to 
see that 1
2 is equivalent to 2
4, 3
6, and 4
8, as they stack 
pieces for fourths, sixths, and eighths on one-half 
of the shape. Fraction strips (see Activity 13.12) and 
number lines (see Activity 13.13) provide the means 
for additional study of equivalent common fractions. 
Students can work individually or in small groups 
to determine the equivalency of common fractions 
illustrated by each device. Encourage children to 
ﬁ nd the pattern that develops for an equivalent class 
of fractions. An equivalent class contains common 
fractions that are names for a given part of a whole. 
The equivalent class for 1
2 is 1
2, 2
4, 3
6, 4
8, 5
10 . . . . When 
children examine the common fractions in this set, 
they see that the numerator of each successive nu-
meral is one greater than the preceding numerator 
and that each denominator is two greater than the 
denominator of the preceding numeral.

fractions for 1

Ordering Fractions
When children have a good foundational under-
standing of the role of the numerator and denomina-
tor in a common fraction, they are able to order frac-
tions by magnitude without resorting to models or 
a number line to compare them. One way they can 
order fractions, as suggested in Activity 13.14, is to 
use benchmarks. Children can easily tell if a fraction 
is greater than 1, so they can use 1 as a benchmark 
E

 
Chapter 13 Developing Understanding of Common and Decimal Fractions 
277
to order the fractions 7
8 and 15
11. Because the numera-
tor in 15
11 is larger than the denominator, 15
11 is larger 
than 1 (15
11  11
11  4
11). Common fractions can also 
be ordered by comparison to 1
2. Consider 2
5 and 5
9. 
Children can tell that 5
9 is greater than 1
2 by doubling 
the numerator of each fraction and then comparing 
the result to its respective denominator. In the case 
of 2
5, when the numerator is doubled (2  2  4) 
the result is less than the denominator of 5, so 2
5 is 
less than 1
2. In the case of 5
9, when the numerator is 
doubled (2  5  10) the result is greater than the 
denominator 9, so 5
9 is larger than 1
2.
When two common fractions have the same de-
nominator, they are easy to compare. For example, 
given the common fractions 3
7 and 5
7, it is easy for 
children to determine that 5
7 is the larger common 
fraction. The reasoning is that 3
7 represents only 3 
parts out of 7, whereas 5
7 represents 5 parts out of 7 
(Figure 13.18a).
Similarly, when the numerators are the same, chil-
dren can quickly determine the order of fractions. 
To compare 3
5 and 3
8, children can reason that each 
common fraction involves 3 parts out of the whole. 
In the case of 3
5, there are 5 pieces to a whole, but 
for 3
8 there are 8 pieces to the whole. The size of the 
pieces is larger for 3
5 than for 3
8; therefore 3
5  3
8 (Fig-
ure 13.18b). This line of reasoning can also be used 
to compare two fractions, such as 8
11 and 11
14. In this 
case both fractions are 3 parts short of a whole— 3
11 
and 3
14, respectively.
Notice that 3
11 and 3
14 have the same numerator. 
Using the method just discussed, we can conclude 
that 3
11  3
14 (Figure 13.19). That means that 8
11 needs a 
larger part to be equal to a whole, so 8
11 is the smaller 
of the two fractions.

Rounding Decimal Fractions
A major goal of mathematics is for children to 
reason as they work with numbers. One aspect of 
reasoning is the ability to judge whether answers 
make sense. The ability to round decimal fractions 
empowers children to make estimates to determine 
whether their answers are reasonable.
Number lines help children learn to round whole 
numbers; they can also be used to learn how to 
round decimal fractions. The number lines pictured 
in Figure 13.17 can be extended to give children a 
model that shows a decimal number line that ex-
tends beyond the number 1. Paper adding machine 
tape is a handy source of paper on which to make 
an extended number line. In Activity 13.15 chil-
dren use a cooperative-learning strategy to learn to 
round decimal tenths to whole numbers. A number 
line that is divided into hundredths can be used in 
a similar way to show how to round hundredths to 
tenths or to whole numbers.
To round a decimal hundredth to tenths, chil-
dren apply a rule similar to the one they used for 
rounding tenths to whole numbers. For example, the 
number 0.67 is rounded to 0.70 because it is closer 
to 0.70 than 0.60 on the line. The number 0.23 is 
E

(b)
Figure 13.18 Comparing fractions with (a) the same
denominator and (b) the same numerator
Figure 13.19 Comparing fractions when numerator and
denominator differ by the same amount

rounded to 0.20 because it is closer to 0.20 than 0.30. 
The number 0.25 is rounded to 0.30. The extended 
number line shows that when a decimal hundredth 
is rounded to a whole number, the point midway 
between two whole numbers determines whether a 
number is rounded down or up. The decimal frac-
tion 1.23 is rounded down to 1.00 because its deci-
mal part is less than 0.50, whereas the number 1.65 
is rounded up to 2.00 because its decimal part is 
more than 0.50.
The values 2.5 and 3.4 are both properly rounded 
to 3 when rounded to the nearest whole number. 
The expression 3.0 represents a decimal fraction 
that measures 3 to the nearest tenth. Activity 13.16 
provides an opportunity for children to explore the 
effects of rounding to whole numbers. This activity 
helps children understand the effect of rounding 
decimal fractions and the importance of represent-
ing decimals accurately. Activity 13.17 is an assess-
ment activity for writing fractions.
ACTIVITY 13.15
 
Rounding Decimals to Whole Numbers
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Cooperative learning
Objective: Students demonstrate a strategy for rounding decimal 
tenths to whole numbers.
Materials: A number line, made from adding machine tape, 
marked to show tenths to 4.0, with “Dump the Trash” writ-
ten at 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0, two for each team. (A line about 3 
feet long is suitable; a few trees and shrubs along the line adds 
realism.)
•  Tell the children to imagine that they are participating in 
a clean-up day along a 4-mile hiking trail. Each mile is 
marked in tenths, and there is a Dump-the-Trash station 
at each milepost. Each team of four is to determine which 
mileposts are the ones to go to to push their cart of trash 
the shortest distance each time it is unloaded. Write these 
decimals on the chalkboard: 2.3, 3.6, 0.7, 2.5. These 
numbers tell where a team is each time they have a full 
load of trash.
•  There are four students in each group, organized into two 
two-member teams. Both teams solve the same problems. 
The ﬁ rst member of a team determines where to go with 
trash from 2.3 miles on the trail. The other member can 
coach, if necessary. When each pair has ﬁ nished the ﬁ rst 
problem and the coach determines that it is correct, they 
switch roles. When two problems have been solved, the 
teams stop working and check with each other. If all four 
agree on the answers, they proceed to the next two. If 
they disagree, they review each other’s thinking to reach 
agreement before moving on.
•  When all groups are ﬁ nished, ask each team to tell 
whether they agreed throughout the lesson or whether 
there were disagreements. How were the disagreements 
resolved? Is everyone on the team satisﬁ ed with the 
agreements?
•  Discuss the rules for rounding decimal fractions: When 
the tenths part of the number is less than 5, the number 
is rounded to the next lower whole number. When the 
tenths part of the number is greater than 5, the number 
is rounded to the next larger whole number. When the 
decimal is 0.5, the number is rounded to the next larger 
whole number. (This is the way it is most commonly done. 
A second method considers the whole number when 
determining which way to round. When the whole num-
ber is even, the number is rounded up. When the whole 
number is odd, the number is rounded down.)
•  Tell the children that a decimal less than 1 is rounded to 
1 if the number in the tenths place is 5 or more. Decimals 
less than 0.5 are not rounded to whole numbers.

Rounding Decimal Circles
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Pairs of students
Objective: Students use several sets of decimal circles to establish 
the effects of rounding on decimal fractions.
Materials: Decimal circles (see Black-Line Master 13.7), ruler, 
scissors
•  Pair students by using your alphabetized class roster to 
match the ﬁ rst and last children, second and next to last, 
and so forth.
•  Pass out to each student pair a sheet of circles, a scissors, 
and a ruler.
•  Direct students to cut out the entire rectangles containing 
each set of circles.
•  Have students measure the diameter of each circle in Set 1 
and record their measurements in a chart, as shown here.

•  For Set 1, have children cut out the entire rectangle con-
taining Circle A, and then cut out Circle A without cutting 
into the remaining part of the rectangle. Be sure children 
save the resulting rectangle with the hole in it. Now they 
should cut out Circles B and C, and discard any remaining 
parts of the rectangle that contained these two circles. 
Students should now have one rectangle with a hole and 
two circles.
•  Ask children to try to ﬁ t each circle into the hole. Suggest 
that since the hole and the two circles all have the same 
rounded value, they should be a good ﬁ t.
•  Ask children to record on their chart what happened 
when they tried to ﬁ t the circles into the hole.
•  Repeat with Set 2 and Set 3.

•  Once each pair has completed recording their measure-
ments, ask what is true about their rounded decimal frac-
tions for each circle. (Answer: They are the same.)
•  As a culminating activity, ask each pair of students to ex-
plain how it can be that all three circles seemingly have the 
same diameter once rounded, but two of the circles do not 
ﬁ t into the third circle.

Take-Home Activities
This take-home activity provides opportunities for 
parents and children to interact as they deal with 
common fractions. Playing pieces for the activity 
can be cut from colored construction paper on 
which shapes have been duplicated. A die can be 
made with a wooden block and round adhesive 
labels on which the fractions have been written. 
Zippered plastic bags can be used to hold the 
materials needed for one game. (Parents who do 
volunteer work in classrooms can prepare materials 
for both in-class and take-home activities.)

Dear Parent:
Accompanying this letter are directions and materials for two games that 
will help your child understand the meaning of common fractions and learn 
about common fractions that are equivalent to each other. The plastic bag 
contains whole circles; pieces that show halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, and 
eighths; and a die marked 1
2, 1
3,  1
4, 1
6, 1
8, and 2
8. Here are directions for the games.
Cover the Circle: This game can be played by as many as four players. Each 
player begins with a whole circle. In turn, players roll the die and cover their 
circles with parts of circles. For example, when a player rolls 1
4, a part show-
ing one-fourth of a circle or two parts showing one-eighth of a circle can be 
put on the whole circle. When a person cannot cover the remaining space on 
a circle with the piece or pieces indicated by a roll of the die, he or she must 
wait for another turn. The ﬁ rst person to cover a circle is the winner.
Uncover Your Circle: This game can be played by up to four players. Players 
begin by covering their circles with two of the half pieces. In turn, players roll 
the die and uncover their circles by removing the fractional amount indicated 
by the die. Exchanges of pieces will be needed as the game is played. If  1
4 
comes up on the ﬁ rst roll, a one-half piece can be exchanged for two one-
fourth pieces, then one one-fourth piece can be removed. If a player does not 
have a piece to remove or cannot make an exchange after a roll of the die, 
he or she must wait for another turn. The ﬁ rst player to uncover a circle is the 
winner.

Summary
Activities that give children an understanding of com-
mon and decimal fractions are an essential part of the el-
ementary school curriculum. The work done in the early 
years serves as a foundation for more abstract concepts 
in higher grades. The intent in elementary school is to 
provide children with basic ideas about these numerals.
Common fractions have several meanings, depend-
ing on the context in which they are used. Children learn 
that common fractions are used to express parts of a unit 
or set of objects that has been partitioned into equal-
size parts or groups, to express ratios, and to indicate 
division. Decimal fractions are used to represent parts 
of wholes or collections of objects but have denomina-
tors that are 10 or a power of 10. The denominator is not 
written but is indicated by the number of numerals there 
are to the right of the ones place in a decimal numeral. 
Students need experiences with concrete and semicon-
crete models that represent both types of numerals and 
their uses. Geometric regions, fraction strips, markers, 
number lines, and various manipulatives are used dur-
ing initial activities. These same materials help students 
to learn about equivalent fractions and to compare com-
mon fractions. Basic concepts of ratio can be developed 
with investigations of settings involving purchases of 
common items, such as gum or pencils.
Materials such as Cuisenaire sets, construction paper 
kits, fraction strips, and number lines are aids that stu-
dents can use to learn the meaning of decimal fractions. 
Once the meaning of decimal fractions is understood 
and students can write decimal numerals accurately, 
they are ready to learn to round decimals to the nearest 
whole unit or to another decimal place.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Think back to your own experiences with common 
and decimal fractions in elementary school. Do you 
believe that the instruction you received helped you 
develop a good understanding of these numbers? 
Envision a classroom in which the teacher invokes 
teaching procedures based on the philosophy of 
this chapter. How does the classroom you envision 
compare with classrooms of your experience?
 2.  Which representation of fractions is more appeal-
ing to you, fraction strips or fraction circles? Explain 
your answer.
 3.  How can having a good visual conception of frac-
tion benchmarks beneﬁ t children?
 4.  Create a scenario for a pairs/check cooperative-
learning exercise that can be used to help children 
learn to round decimal hundredths to tenths and/or 
to whole numbers (see Activity 13.16).

Using Children’s Literature
(Grades 3– 4) The plot in Alexander, Who Used to Be 
Rich Last Sunday (Judith Viorst, New York: Aladdin 
Paperbacks, 1978) involves Alexander, a boy who gets 
$1.00 on Sunday from his grandparents. In the course of 
the week Alexander fritters the whole dollar away. Chil-
dren can write the numerical representation for each 
part of the story. For example, one of Alexander’s broth-
ers has two dollars, three quarters, one dime, seven 
nickels, and eighteen pennies. Children can also write 
the numerical equations that keep track of Alexander’s 
money. At various times during the week Alexander 
spends 11 cents, then 15 cents, and then 12 cents. The 
amount of money that remains after each day can be 
linked to stages in the story.

Technology Resources
Applets
One of the most exciting developments in educational 
technology is the growing number of mathematics ap-
plets available on the Internet. An applet is an interac-
tive dynamic program that allows the user to manipu-
late images on the screen to discover and demonstrate 
mathematics relationships. The applet discussed here 
was produced by the National Council of Teachers 
of Mathematics (NCTM). The applet—or mathlet, as 
NCTM designates these interactive activities—is called 
Fraction Pie (available at http://illuminations.nctm.org). 
It is one of many mathlets maintained by NCTM for all 
mathematics levels, from Pre-K– 2 to 9– 12.
 
Students can use this particular mathlet to explore 
in a dynamic setting what happens to the value of a 
common fraction when the numerator and/or denomi-
nator is changed. The screen captures of the applet 
shown here demonstrate how 1
6 and 1
10 are displayed at 
the site. Students can change the size of the denomina-
tor by dragging the appropriate slider. As they do so, 
all the data on the page change, as does the diagram. 
Students can experiment freely to build their under-
standing of how an increase in the denominator shrinks 
the size of a common fraction. In this case students see 
1
6 change to 1
7, then 1
8, then 1
9, and ﬁ nally 1
10. This website 
has the ability to display fractions with numerators and 
denominators up to 100.
 
283
 
Similarly, children can change the value of the nu-
merator in a fraction and determine that as the number 
increases in a numerator, so does the value of the result-
ing common fraction. The screen captures show this 
function using a rectangle for the whole. Here children 
can see  1
6 change to  2
6, 3
6, 4
6, and ﬁ nally 5
6.
 
The mathlet also represents common fractions as 
parts of sets, so children can experiment with these 
fractions in three different representations: circles, rect-
angles, and sets. Older children can take advantage of 
the display of equivalent decimal fractions and percents 
for every common fraction they enter to build their 

knowledge of the relationships between common frac-
tions, decimal fractions, and percents. Older children 
can also enter fractions greater than 1.

set of decimal fractions. The challenge is to order the 
decimals one at a time for Builder Ted. There are three 
levels to the game, with the highest level including deci-
mal fractions less than 0. There are sound effects that 
are amusing but could be distracting. The sound effects 
can be turned off.

Extending 
Understanding 
of Common and 
Decimal Fractions
nstruction about common and decimal fractions in the 
lower grades is directed not so much toward making 
children skillful in performing operations but toward 
building a foundation that can be expanded in the 
higher grades. The focus in lower grades is on conceptual 
understanding of the meaning of fractions, both common and 
decimal. According to Professional Standards for School Mathematics (Na-
tional Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000, p. 152), middle-grade stu-
dents “develop their understanding of and ability to employ the algorithms 
for the basic operations with common and decimal fractions. They should 
be able to develop strategies for computing with familiar fractions and 
decimals.” Younger students might engage in some activities that introduce 
the concepts of the four operations with fractions, but the formal study of 
the respective algorithms and ﬂ uency in them is a focus of the middle-
grades mathematics curriculum.
 
In the early grades children construct their understanding of common 
and decimal fractions and learn about addition and subtraction with ratio-
nal numbers. Work with common and decimal fractions continues in upper 
elementary school as children deal with these fractions on a more symbolic 
level, advance their understanding of addition and subtraction, and learn 
the meaning of multiplication and division. In the middle grades the famil-
iar algorithms for all four operations with common and decimal fractions

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Standards and Fractional 
Numbers
State mathematics standards agree that when teach-
ing children about common and decimal fractions, 
the emphasis should be on connecting the two ways 
of representing fractional numbers. Students should 
see mathematics as uniﬁ ed rather than as a series of 
separate ideas. When children understand that com-
mon and decimal fractions and percents are differ-
ent representations of the same numbers, they are 
empowered to deal conﬁ dently and accurately with 
problems that involve these numbers using concrete, 
pictorial, and symbolic representations as well as 
technology. Although we have chosen to consider 
percent in Chapter 15 as part of proportional reason-
ing, we maintain that percent concepts and skills 
should be developed at the same time as common 
and decimal concepts and skills. Activities with com-
mon and decimal fractions provide students with 
connections between the numerals and processes—
and with the real-world situations from which they 
arise. Once settings and algorithms are understood, 
children can decide whether to use a paper-and-pen-
cil algorithm estimation, mental computation, or a 
calculator or computer to solve problems.
are emphasized, as is development of proportional reasoning and problem 
solving with percents. In this chapter we discuss the mathematical proce-
dures for computing (algorithms) with common and decimal fractions, but 
these algorithms are the ﬁ nal result of many activities and experiences that 
build students’ conceptual understanding of them. Students should use these 
algorithms because the speciﬁ c procedure makes sense in the context of a 
problem and not because they have memorized a set of computational steps. 
Thus we focus on those concept-building activities ﬁ rst and then discuss the 
algorithms that develop from them.
In this chapter you will read about:
1  Ways to extend the concept of place value to include decimal 
fractions
2  Ways to model addition and subtraction with common and decimal 
fractions and to develop understanding of these operations and their

Chapter 14 Extending Understanding of Common and Decimal Fractions 
289
Teaching Children About 
Fractional Numbers in Elementary 
and Middle School
The topics in this chap-
ter—common 
fraction 
operations and decimal 
fraction operations—are 
generally emphasized in 
the middle school cur-
riculum (grades 6– 8). In 
Principles and Standards 
for School Mathematics
the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics 
(2000, p. 215) states, “In 
the middle grades (6– 8) 
students should become 
facile in working with frac-
tions, percents, and deci-
mals.” Elementary grades 
provide the foundation 
for work with fractions, 
decimals, and percents. 
Only on a ﬁ rm founda-
tion of conceptual understanding can children later 
become facile with operations and applications of 
fractions, decimals, and percents.
The topics in this chapter include some topics 
that are developed more fully in the middle grades, 
for several reasons. First, elementary school teach-
ers need a sense of the mathematics and related 
applications and activities to come in the middle 
grades in order to prepare their students for mid-
dle-grade mathematics topics. Second, elementary 
school teachers provide activities that introduce 
these middle school top-
ics for their elementary 
school students. Finally, 
all children in the United 
States in grades 3– 8 are re-
quired by the No Child Left 
Behind Act to take tests in 
reading and mathemat-
ics. The speciﬁ c content 
of these tests varies from 
state to state, according to 
the mathematics frame-
work of each state. Where 
you teach will determine what aspects, if any, of 
the topics considered in this chapter are part of the 
grade 4, 5, or 6 tests for your students.
NCTM Number and Operations

number system and be able to represent and compare 
whole numbers and decimals;
•  recognize equivalent representations for the same num-
ber and generate them by decomposing and composing 
numbers;

wholes, as parts of a collection, as locations on number 
lines, and as divisions of whole numbers;
•  use models, benchmarks, and equivalent forms to judge 
the size of fractions;
•  recognize and generate equivalent forms of commonly 
used fractions, decimals, and percents;

Extending Understanding 
of Decimal Fractions
By the time children enter the upper elementary 
grades, they have learned that decimal fractions 
are one way to represent and work with fractional 
numbers. Children in grades 5 and 6 are ready to 
deal with more complex concepts involving these 
numerals. We now discuss ways to help students ex-
tend their understanding of the place-value scheme 
for whole numbers to include decimal fractions.
Children use a variety of materials and proce-
dures to learn that 0.3, 0.13, and 1.3 are equivalent 
to the common fractions 3
10, 13
100, and 13
10. Lessons such 
as the ones that follow help children see that deci-
mal fractions extend the Hindu-Arabic numeration 
system to represent fractional parts as well as whole 
units. Activity 14.1 uses a place-value pocket chart to 
help students recognize that decimal fractions are 
an extension of whole numbers in the Hindu-Ara-
bic numeration system. In Activity 14.2 a classroom 
version of an abacus is used. This abacus can be 
made with wooden beads on pieces of coat-hanger 
wire stuck in a 2-foot piece of 2  4 wood. When 
an abacus represents decimals, a rod other than the 
one on the far right indicates the ones place. Activity 
14.3 helps older students complete the connection 
between place value for whole numbers and place 
value for decimal fractions. As they do this activity, 
children learn that the ones place, not the decimal 
point, is the point of symmetry for place value in the 
Hindu-Arabic numeration system. Moving in both 
directions from the ones place, students ﬁ nd tens 
and tenths, then hundreds and hundredths, then 
thousands and thousandths, and so forth.
Decimal Fractions and Number Density
Once children understand how to name decimal 
fractions, teachers can use decimal fractions to help 
children understand the density of numbers. The 
density property of numbers stipulates that there 
is always another number between any two numbers. 
This is difﬁ cult to show with common fractions—
for example, 1
5 and 1
6. It is easier to demonstrate den-
sity with decimal fractions. For example, what is a 
number between 1 and 2? Children who are begin-
ning a study of decimal fractions could locate these 
two numbers on a number line and divide the inter-
val between 1 and 2 into 10 parts (Figure 14.1a). Any 
decimal fraction represented by the interval mark-
ings is a number between 1 and 2. In Figure 14.1a 
the number 1.3 is represented. Students can then be 
asked to locate one of the numbers between 1 and 
2 on the number line (1.3 as shown here). Teachers 
can locate other values between 1 and 2 and then

ACTIVITY 14.1
 
Place-Value Pocket Chart
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students extend their concept of place value to include 
decimal fractions.
Materials: A place-value pocket chart. This is a device about 24 
inches wide and 18 inches high with three or four parallel slots 
that hold 3  5 cards. It is used to represent place value. For this 
lesson a chart will represent ones and tenths. Also needed is a 
kit of decimal fraction learning aids for each child. Use Cuisenaire 
rods or any other materials with which the children are familiar.
•  Have children recall previous knowledge with a quick 
review of place value for whole numbers.
•  Write the decimal fraction 3.4 on the chalkboard, and 
instruct each child to represent it with a chart from their 
kit materials, as shown here.
•  Show a pocket chart that contains three bundles of tenths 
pieces and four single tenth pieces. Explain that each 
card stands for one-tenth. Ask: “How are three bundles 
of tenths cards like the three unit pieces in your kits.” 
(Answer: They represent three units.) “How are the four 
tenths in the chart like the tenth pieces in the kits?” (An-
swer: They represent four-tenths.)
•  Repeat with other decimal fractions, including some with 
no tenths and some with no units. The display in the ﬁ rst 
chart shown below has no units; the correct numeral for 
this display is 0.5. In the second chart there are no tenths; 
the numeral is 4.0.
•  Ask: “How do the numerals 10 and 1.0 differ? What does 
the “1” in 10 stand for?” (Answer: 1 ten.) “What does 
the “0” stand for?” (Answer: no ones, or 0 ones.) “What 
does the “1” in 1.0 stand for?” (Answer: 1 one.) “What 
does the “0” stand for?” (Answer: no tenths, or 0 tenths.) 
Point out that tens are to the left and tenths are to the 
right of the ones place.

Decimals on an Abacus

Objective: Students demonstrate how to place decimal points 
correctly to represent mixed decimal fractions and to read the 
numbers.
Materials: A classroom abacus, 81
2  11 paper containing 534123 
written six times in large numerals, marking pen for each student
•  Organize the class into groups of four for a think-share 
cooperative-learning activity. Display the abacus with a 
decimal point located between the ﬁ rst and second rods 
at the right to represent the number 53,412.3. Tell each 
team to place the decimal point in the number repre-
sented on the abacus in 
the numeral at the top of 
the paper. Teams meet 
to check agreement of 
responses. When all teams 
agree, move on.
•  In think-share cooperative learning, students respond 
independently to a problem from the teacher or a fellow 
student. The setting for this activity is: “There are ﬁ ve nu-
merals on your papers. Each of you is to move the decimal 
point to the left, one position at a time, as you go down 
the paper. When all members of your team are ﬁ nished, 
meet and take turns reading the numbers. Each member 
must read one of the numbers.” Give students time to 
think and talk.
•  The ﬁ nal group assignment is to collaborate on a state-
ment that explains the value of each of the numerals 5, 3, 
4, 1, 2, and 3 in one of the numbers. Each team selects 
its own number. For example, if a group selects 5,341.23, 
then students would evaluate each numeral in the number 
(e.g., the numeral 5 represents ﬁ ve thousand).
•  Groups share their statements. If any numbers were not 
selected, the class discusses the place value of numerals in 
them.

repeat the activity with other numbers, such as 4 
and 5, 15 and 16, and 98 and 99.
The same process can be used for decimal frac-
tions that appear to be adjacent, such as 0.4 and 0.5. 
These two decimal fractions might also be located 
on a number line and the interval between them di-
vided into 10 equal parts (Figure 14.1b). The decimal 
fraction that names any of the intervals is a number 
between 0.4 and 0.5, in this case 0.46. Similarly, the 
same technique will work for other decimal frac-
tions, such as 1.32 and 1.33. The two decimal frac-
tions can be displayed on a number line, and the 
interval between them divided into 10 parts (Figure 
14.1c). As shown here, one of the numbers between 
1.32 and 1.33 is 1.324.
Expanded Notation 
for Decimal Fractions
By the end of grade 6 some children will be ready 
to learn an abstract way to think about and repre-
sent decimal fractions. These forms are extensions 
of earlier expanded notation forms introduced with 
whole numbers. In expanded notation, 54,326 is rep-
resented as
54,326  (5  104)  (4  103)  (3  102) 
 (2  101)  (6  100)
These expanded decimal notations are appropriate 
only for children who have a mature understanding 
of numbers and for whom the notations will have 
ACTIVITY 14.3

Level: Grades 3 and 4
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students demonstrate the concept of symmetry around 
the ones place in the decimal place-value scheme.
Materials: A chart like the one given here, displayed on a 
large piece of butcher paper or an overhead projector 
transparency:
•  Display the chart. Point out that the ones place is in the 
center of the chart.
•  Ask: “What is the value of the 3 to the left of the ones 
place?” (Answer: 3 tens.) “What is the value of the 3 to 
the right of the ones place?” (Answer: 3 tenths.)
•  Repeat with the 3’s in the hundreds and hundredths 
places and the 3’s in the thousands and thousandths 
places.
•  Discuss that the ones place is the point of symmetry, or 
balance, and that the tens place is to its immediate left 
and the tenths place is to its immediate right, the hun-
dreds place is two places to the left and the hundredths 
place is two places to the right, and so on.
•  Point out that each place-value position has a value that 
is 10 times greater than the position to its immediate 
right and that a value is one-tenth as much as that of the 
position to its immediate left, regardless of where it is in 
relation to the ones place.

Extending Concepts of Common 
and Decimal Fraction Operations
Addition and Subtraction with 
Common and Decimal Fractions
Children have a solid understanding of and skill 
in performing addition and subtraction operations 
with whole numbers by the time they encounter ad-
dition and subtraction with common and decimal 
fractions. A strong conceptual understanding of 
addition and subtraction serves as the foundation 
for study of the same operations with fractional 
numbers. Just as children used physical models as 
they learned about whole number operations, they 
should learn how operations with fractions work in 
the same manner. Addition of fractional numbers is 
a joining operation, just as addition of whole num-
bers is. Subtraction with fractional numbers arises 
from the same four situations as those with whole 
numbers: takeaway, comparison, completion, and 
whole-part-part (Figure 14.2).

Addition and Subtraction 
with Common Fractions
Addition and subtraction with common fractions 
involves computation when there are like denomi-
nators (e.g., 2
5 and 4
5), unlike denominators (e.g., 
2
3 and 3
4), and mixed numerals (e.g., 23
8 and 61
6). Work 
E
with these operations is spread over several years, 
to accommodate the different levels of difﬁ culty and 
children’s increasing maturity, and moves progres-
sively from common fractions with like denomina-
tors to common fractions with unlike denominators 
and ﬁ nally to mixed numerals. An integral aspect of 
a smooth progression through these different types 
of common fractions is a basic understanding of the 
parts of a fraction and their effect on the value of a 
fraction, as stressed in the early part of this chapter. 
For example, a student who understands the differ-
ence between 2
3 and 2
5 also understands that they

cannot be added directly because they name differ-
ent fractional parts of a whole. A common fractional 
part for these two fractions (common denominator) 
is needed in order to add them.
Adding and Subtracting 
with Like Denominators
The setting within which children work should be 
stocked with familiar learning aids: geometric re-
gions left whole and cut into fractional parts, frac-
tion-strip sets, and number-line charts. Activity 14.4 
illustrates a problem that can be used for children’s 
ﬁ rst work with addition of common fractions. As 
you read the activity, note that the addition does not 
begin with the simplest combinations, such as 1
4  1
4
or 1
2  1
2. Children who have many experiences with 
fraction manipulatives develop a good understand-
ing of common fractions. They “just know” easy 
combinations such as 1
4  1
4  1
2 and that 1
2  1
2  2
2, or 
one whole, through early experiences with various 
fraction manipulatives. In 
Activity 14.4 children use 
the processes that make 
sense to them at the mo-
ment. The teacher makes 
no 
suggestions 
about 
how to proceed. Rather, 
children determine the 
answer to the problem 
in many ways, through 
manipulation of concrete 
materials and with mental 
and symbolic processes. 
Student presentations and discussions of the dif-
ferent processes help children reﬁ ne their thinking 
as they discover simpler and faster ways to work. 
Many children will abandon learning aids in favor 
of mental and symbolic processes as they move 
along in Activity 14.5 and subsequent activities. 
Thus, although the goal is to have children develop 
conﬁ dence and facility with symbolic processes, 
children use manipulatives whenever they need to. 
At ﬁ rst, the symbols record what the student can 
see and do with the manipulative objects. Children 
who have sufﬁ cient experiences with manipulatives 
can eventually work efﬁ ciently with symbols. Activ-
ity 14.5 uses a calculator to introduce addition with 
common fractions.
Using Algorithms to Compute 
with Fractional Numbers
Mathematics educators disagree about whether 
elementary school children should be taught stan-
dard algorithms for computing with common frac-
tions. Advocates for allowing students to continue 
using invented algorithms, such as the one used by 
Jawawn in Activity 14.4, delay introducing standard 
algorithms. Others contend that introducing algo-
rithms in the elementary grades lays the foundation 
for using symbols and algorithms in algebra. As 
students expand their understanding of operations 
through problem-solving activities, such as those of 
Activities 14.4 and 14.5, they develop the standard 
algorithms. When children move from invented 
algorithms to standard algorithms in this manner, 
they have a strong understanding and recall of the 
Research for the Classroom
•
In a recent study (Aksu, 1997), sixth-grade students were 
given a series of problems involving all four operations 
with common fractions (addition, subtraction, multiplica-
tion, and division). The study was done in two settings: 
computational and contextual. In the computational set-
ting the examples were devoid of any context and were 
simply presented to the students in a form such as 22
3  
41
5  ?. In the contextual setting the fraction operations 
were embedded in word problems.
 
One ﬁ nding of Aksu’s study was that there was no dif-
ference in success (problems solved correctly) with any of 
the operations in the computational setting. The students 
were able to complete examples using all four operations 
equally well. Their success was far higher with the com-
putational problems than with the contextual problems. 
In every operation, students did signiﬁ cantly better when 
they could solve the problem without any context. Among 
the contextual problems themselves, addition problems 
were the simplest and multiplication operations were the 
most difﬁ cult.
 
There are several implications for the classroom. Stu-
dents need ample experience solving fraction problems in 
context, not just in isolated computational settings. Many 
realistic stories should form the problem-solving context 
for fraction work. Furthermore, the difﬁ culty students 
had with multiplication problems in context points to the 
need to provide students with many experiences with such 
problems (Aksu, 1997).

standard algorithms. Suggestions for doing this are 
included in activities for each of the operations.
When you introduce an operation, such as addi-
tion, with problem settings and allow time for solu-
tions to emerge, children call on experiences with 
whole numbers as they work. For example, children 
in Activity 14.4 recognized that addition with com-
mon fractions is a joining operation and that con-
crete aids or abstract processes are ways to solve 
problems. They may also discern that words and 
written symbols are ways of representing problems 
and that a given fraction has different names.
Allow students the opportunity to represent sev-
eral displays of addition with various materials for 
problems of the sort seen in Activity 14.4. Then ask 
students to display an addition sentence for each 
of the problems and call attention to them: “What 
have we done in each sentence to determine the 
sum?” Guide the children to see that the numera-
tors are added. Children will discern that the pattern 
for these examples is that the numerators are added 
and the denominator remains unchanged. Thus 
they begin to understand the algorithm for adding 
fractions with the same denominators: Find the sum

Adding Common Fractions (Communication)
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students develop strategies for adding common frac-
tions with like denominators.
Materials: Fraction kit materials, commercial or teacher-made;

•  Explain to children how they will use the pairs/check co-
operative-learning format. Present a situation that involves 
addition of common fractions: “Pablo practiced soccer for 
3
4 of an hour on Thursday and 3
4 of an hour on Friday. How 
long did he practice on the two days?”
•  Each student in a pair works with materials of choice 
to determine the answer. When ﬁ nished, pairs discuss 
their solutions and clear up any discrepancies. Pairs join 
other pairs to share all four solutions. Check to determine 
whether anyone in the group has a question.
•  Share solutions by having each student in a pair explain 
the partner’s solution. Possible responses are:
•  Sally used fourths of fraction circles to represent each of 
the three-quarter hours. She put them together to make 
six-fourths, or one and one-half hours. Kameta used the 
classroom clock. She started at 12 and mentally went 
around the clock, three-quarters of an hour at a time, 
until she was at one-thirty. That’s one and one-half 
hours.
•  Karl used fraction strips. He used a one-half and a one-
fourth piece to make one three-quarters; then he did 
the same to make the second three-quarters. The two 
one-half pieces made an hour, and the two one-quarter 
pieces made a half-hour. They showed that two three-
fourths are the same as one and one-half. Lee did the 
work in his head. He said he knew that three-fourths 
is the same as a one-half and a one-fourth. He said he 
knew that the halves made a whole and the fourths 
made a half; that’s one and one-half.

Realistic situations should be used as children 
work with common fractions in each of the four 
situations involving subtraction: takeaway, compari-
son, completion, and whole-part-part. The following 
problems illustrate how you might have children be-
gin work with subtraction of common fractions:
•  Takeaway: Raven had 121
2 inches of ribbon. She 
used 43
4 inches for a bow. How much ribbon does 
she have now?
•  Comparison: Britt found a shell that measured 63
8 
inches across. Trumane found a shell that mea-
sured 53
4 inches across. How much longer was 
Britt’s shell?
•  Completion: Carla needs a mixture of 13
16 pound 
of ﬂ our for tortillas. She has 7
16 of a pound of 
corn ﬂ our that she will mix with wheat ﬂ our. 
How much wheat ﬂ our will she add to the corn 
ﬂ our?
•  Whole-part-part: Josh has 81
2 pounds of Cortland 
and Granny Smith apples. There are 21
2 pounds 
of Granny Smith apples. How many pounds of 
Cortland apples does Josh have?
Give children time to determine a solution 
to these and similar problems, individually or in 
groups. Investigations with different fraction mod-
els and pictures should precede introduction of an 
algorithm. A discussion of the situations, children’s 
models for them, and the algorithms will help stu-
dents see that only numerators are used to compute 
answers in subtraction. This conjecture can be com-
pared to the rule for adding common fractions with 
the same denominator.

ACTIVITY 14.6
 
Adding with Unlike Denominators
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students discover strategies for adding common frac-
tions with unlike denominators.
Materials: Fraction kit materials, commercial or teacher-made; 
common fraction number line; paper and pencils
•  Begin with a review of different ways that common frac-
tions can be named. For example, 1
2 can be 2
4, 3
6, 4
8, and so 
on. Have the children give other names for 1
4, 1
3, 1
5, and 1
6.
•  Tell the children to use the pairs/check format. Present a 
problem: “While making clothes for her doll, Mae used 1
2 
yard of material for a skirt and 1
4 yard for a blouse. What 
part of a yard did she use for the outﬁ t?”
•  Have pairs work and check their answers. They can use 
any materials and procedures they choose. Share results in 
groups of four.
•  Examples of the responses are:
•  Kelly used a one-half and a one-fourth fraction strip and 
got three-fourths.
•  Abdul used one-half of a circle and one-fourth of circle. 
When he put them together, he had three-fourths of a 
circle. The answer is three-fourths of a yard.
•  Lamont thought: One-half is the same as two-
fourths, add two-fourths to one-fourth and you have 
three-fourths.
•  Give additional problems to solve and share responses:
•  Andrea sewed a border on a head scarf. Two sides were 
7
8 yard long, and the other two sides were 1
2 yard wide. 
How many yards of border did she use?
•  Chun Lei used 3
4 of a cup of onion and 5
6 of a cup of bok 
choy in a stir fry dish. How many cups of vegetables did 
she use?
•  When discussion of the three problems is complete, have 
one child write the sentence for the ﬁ rst problem on the 
chalkboard and explain the algorithm.
•  Have student volunteers write sentences and explain pro-
cesses for the other two problems.
Adding and Subtracting When 
Denominators Are Different
When addition and subtraction are performed with 
common fractions that have unlike denominators, 
the situation is more complex than when denomi-
nators are the same. Begin with problems that use 
reasonable denominators (10 or smaller), and allow 
children time to determine solutions. Activity 14.6 il-
lustrates a way to introduce addition with unlike de-
nominators. In the activity children use pairs/check 
cooperative learning with models of their choice 
to solve problems involving addition of unlike frac-
tions. The problems in Activity 14.6 are successively 
more difﬁ cult. In the ﬁ rst problem one of the two 
denominators is a multiple of the other. The second 
problem has denominators that are multiples, but 
there are four addends. Neither denominator is a 
multiple of the other in the third problem; this type 
is most difﬁ cult for children.
A situation in which one denominator is a mul-
tiple of the other is illustrated in this takeaway 
example:
•  When Billy checked, he found 5
6 of a pizza in the 
refrigerator. When he ate a piece that was 1
3 of the 
original pizza, how much pizza was left?

ACTIVITY 14.7
 
Using Fraction Circles to Explore Adding Fractions 
with Unlike Denominators (Representation)
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students develop an understanding of the need for a 
common denominator when combining common fractions with 
unlike denominators.
Materials: Fraction circles, including an overhead projector set
•  Give several sets of fraction circles to each small group. 
Ask students to form the following sum using the 1
2 piece 
and a 1
3 piece.
•  Once all student groups have placed their pieces as shown 
in the ﬁ gure, ask for the sum of the two pieces. Propose 
that the sum of the two pieces is a multiple of 1
2 or 1
3 (it is 
not), and ask students to examine if either case is possible. 
Children will ﬁ nd that one 1
2 piece will not cover both 
pieces and that two 1
2 pieces will overlap both pieces. Simi-
larly, two 1
3 pieces will not cover both pieces, and three 1
3 
pieces will overlap both pieces.
•  Suggest that students try other fraction pieces to ﬁ nd the 
sum of 1
2 and 1
3. When students try to cover both pieces 
with 1
6 pieces, they will ﬁ nd that ﬁ ve of the 1
6 pieces will 
exactly cover both pieces. Thus 1

3  5
6.
•  Have a student volunteer demonstrate the number sen-
tence on the overhead using transparent fraction pieces.
•  Ask if there is any other way to determine the sum of 1
2 
and 1
3. Probe for completing the sum to make a whole. As 
shown here, when a single 1
6 piece is combined with the 
original 1
2 and 1
3 pieces, the result is one whole. Help stu-
dents reason that because the 1
2 and 1
3 pieces equal 1 (or 
6
6) when a 1
6 piece is added to them, then their total with-
out the 1
6 piece must be 5
6.
•  Have student groups use their fraction pieces to represent 
the following sums and write the number sentence that 
results:
1

By the time children deal with situations like these, 
they should have had experiences with a variety

1
3 equals 2
6, and if they take 2
6 from 5
6, the answer is 3
6, 
or 1
2. These children have little difﬁ culty adding and 
subtracting with simple common fractions. Those 
who demonstrate that they can compute answers 
mentally should not be required to use models or 
paper-and-pencil processes. The teacher’s role is 
to encourage children to use mental computation 
when possible and to help them recognize situations 
when it should or should not be used. Mental math 
is most effective with denominators such as the ones 
given here. A problem that uses, for example, 2, 4, or 
8 for denominators or 2, 3, or 6 might be solved us-
ing mental math rather than a process that involves 
having to record every step of the algorithm.
If children have not had sufﬁ cient experiences 
with equivalent fractions by grade 3, the teacher 
should provide time and use the activities suggested 
earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 13. Some chil-
dren will require activities and explorations that fo-
cus on the need for a common denominator when 
adding or subtracting common fractions with unlike 
denominators. Activity 14.7 models a fraction circle 
to help these children understand the need for a 
common denominator in such cases. Fraction circles 
and fraction stencils are available commercially.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving

Even after many experiences representing ad-
dition and subtraction with various models, some 
students beneﬁ t from viewing a model algorithm. 
The model algorithm may be one they are helped 
to develop, it may be one from a group member, or 
it may be provided by the teacher. Such a model 
algorithm should be easy to follow.

Given time to think 
about and discuss pro-
cesses, children use prior 
knowledge to solve the 
more difﬁ cult problems, 
but later they develop 
more symbolic and more 
mental ways to compute. 
Initially they may rely on 
learning aids to visual-
ize and solve problems, 
but later they develop un-
derstandings that enable 
them to use more symbolic ways to compute. It is 
critical that children do not rush to an algorithm 
before they develop these symbolic understand-
ings. A child who moves to a memorized algorithm 
without understanding it needs constant review 
to remember the algorithm. Once children have 
built a foundation about common fractions, they 
should have sufﬁ cient time to develop and prac-
tice algorithms for common fractions and mixed 
numerals.
Adding and Subtracting 
with Mixed Numerals
Adding and subtracting with mixed numerals is an 
extension of prior work with common fractions and 
their operations. The complexity increases when 
operations involve mixed numerals, because now 
there are both whole and fractional numbers. Situa-
tions that involve adding and subtracting mixed nu-
merals are numerous. They arise frequently in deli-
catessens, bakeries, pizza parlors, and other food 
establishments where pies, cakes, pizzas, and other 
foods are cut into fractional parts of a whole to make 
serving-size portions. They arise during handicraft 
activities, where materials 
are measured and cut for 
woodworking, 
clothing, 
basketry, and other proj-
ects. Activity 14.8 uses a 
deli as a setting to intro-
duce addition of mixed 
numerals.
One type of subtrac-
tion with mixed numerals 
is bothersome for many 
children. It arises from a 
situation such as this:
•  Reuben started with 61
3 yards of a crepe paper 
streamer when he made a banner for a track 
meet. He returned 12
3 yards to the craft table. How 
much of the streamer did he use?
One way to illustrate this is with a length of crepe 
paper streamer or adding machine tape. Cut a strip 
61
3 yards long (Figure 14.3). A class discussion might 
proceed like this:
Teacher: Here is the piece of the streamer that 
Reuben began with. How long is it? (Two stu dents 
extend the streamer across the front of the room.)
Jane: Six and one-third yards long.
Teacher: How much of the streamer did Reuben 
return to the table?
Maribel: One and two-thirds yards.
Teacher: Antonio and Felicia, use this yardstick to 
measure the part that Reuben returned to the table. 
(The piece is measured and cut.)
Teacher: How can we determine the amount of 
streamer Reuben used?
Antonio: Measure the piece we are holding. (The 
piece is measured and the answer, 42
3 yards, is 
noted.)
Teacher: Let’s write down what we did:
61
3  12
3  42
3
Teacher: What do you notice about the common 
fractions in this problem?
Ming: 1
3 is less than 2
3.
Teacher: We need to do something with the com-
mon fractions before we subtract them. What do 
you think we can do?
 
Chapter 14 Extending Understanding of Common and Decimal Fractions 
299

Le: Can we change one of the wholes into thirds?
Brandon: If we change one 1 into thirds and add it 
to the one-third, we will have four-thirds. Then we 
can subtract two-thirds from four-thirds. That leaves 
two-thirds (4
3  2
3  2
3).
Althea: And then we can subtract 1 from 5. That 
leaves 4.
Jason: Four and two-thirds is the answer we got 
when we cut and measured the paper.
Teacher: Is there another way to think about the 
problems? We can rename 61
3 as 54
3. Then 5  1  4 
and 4
3  2
3  2
3, so 61
3  12
3  42
3.
This scenario suggests one algorithm for subtract-
ing mixed numerals with regrouping. As with other 
processes in mathematics, some students will invent 
their own algorithms, such as representing 61
3 and 12
3
as thirds (19
3  and 5
3). As suggested earlier in this text, 
you can acknowledge such invented algorithms and 
allow students to use them as initial methods for solv-
ing problems. It may be that the invented algorithm 
will enable the student to solve problems as well as 
the standard algorithm. Consider Krystal’s method 
for subtracting mixed numerals with regrouping:
71
6
71
6
31
3
32
6
 
 
4  1
6  35
6
Can you follow Krystal’s solution method? Notice 
that she subtracts the whole numbers and the frac-
tions separately. In the case of the common frac-
tions, because the top common fraction is smaller 
than the bottom, when she subtracted, she ended 
up with a negative fraction (1
6). This is easily com-
bined with the whole number 4 to result in the cor-
rect answer of 35
6. When Krystal’s teacher asked her 
to demonstrate her method to her class, several of 
her classmates readily adopted Krystal’s method as 
their own (Johnson, 1999).
Note that Krystal’s algorithm is as efﬁ cient as the 
standard algorithm with regrouping in the ﬁ nal steps. 
The logic is easy to follow. Students in Krystal’s class 
who adopt this method may never need the stan-
dard algorithm. Students’ invented algorithms serve

them well and may be the algorithms they will al-
ways use. If Krystal’s approach were less efﬁ cient or 
more time-consuming, students would want to com-
pare the two approaches critically and determine 
which was best for them. Children in Europe and 
South America learn to compute with different al-
gorithms and do well in mathematics. Allowing stu-
dents to explore, explain, and evaluate various algo-
rithms helps them to understand that mathematics 
has many paths for solving problems.
As time passes, children need to maintain their 
skill with algorithms. Practice that emphasizes think-
ing rather than memorized procedures is important. 
For example, students may write stories and draw 
pictures that illustrate addition and subtraction sen-
tences. Sentences such as the following can be used 
to review addition and subtraction with common 
fractions:

Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students develop strategies and algorithms for adding 
mixed numerals and introduce a standard algorithm.
Materials: Fraction kit materials, commercial or teacher-made; 
common fraction number lines; paper and pencils
•  Tell the children that they are going to work in coopera-
tive groups to show one way to model the following 
problem and one way to compute an answer using pencil 
and paper: “There are 11
2 white cakes and 11
4 chocolate 
cakes at a deli counter at 8 o’clock one evening. On an 
average night between 8 and 9, the deli sells enough 
slices to equal three cakes. Is there enough cake on hand 
for average sales on this evening?” This activity could use 
real cakes or brownies as a culminating activity of fraction 
study.
•  Each pair from a group is to use concrete materials or a 
drawing to solve the problem. Then they are to use sym-
bols that show a solution based on the concrete materials 
or drawing. When ﬁ nished, each pair compares its solu-
tions with the group’s other pair.

have enough cake for an average night.
•  Have other pairs explain the ways that they solved the 
problem.
•  Following discussion of models and diagrams, show an 
algorithm for the problem. Have children explain how 
their models and diagrams are represented by numerals in 
the algorithm.

•  Point out that when this algorithm is used, the common 
fractions are renamed with a common denominator. The 1

wich meat did the customer purchase?”
•  “A recipe lists 81

Least Common Multiples 
and Greatest Common Factors
When students add and subtract common fractions 
with unlike denominators, they need to ﬁ nd com-
mon denominators. Many times the denominators 
are multiples, for example,
1
3  5
6  ?
where the common denominator is 6. Renaming 1
3 as 
2
6 is easy for students who have worked with fraction 
materials. In other cases the common denominator 
is found by simply determining the product of the 
two denominators, for example,
3
4  1
3  ?
where the common denominator is 12 (3  4). This 
process of multiplying the denominators always re-
sults in a common denominator, but the resulting 
denominator may be much larger than needed, re-
quiring much more computation than necessary. 
Consider the following example:
7
24  5
36  ?
The common denomina-
tor that results from ﬁ nd-
ing the product of 24 and 
36 (864) is far larger than 
necessary. If 864 were 
used as the common de-
nominator in this problem, 
the solution would require 
a great deal of unneces-
sary computation. There 
are many other common 
E
denominators that are smaller than 864. Finding the 
lowest common denominator (the common de-
nominator with the smallest value) makes sense for 
addition and subtraction problems because the low-
est common denominator, also known as the least 
common multiple (LCM; the common multiple 
with the smallest value), will greatly decrease the 
amount of computation needed to solve the given 
problem.
One way to ﬁ nd the LCM is to complete a prime 
factor tree for each denominator. The factor trees for 
24 and 36 are shown in Figure 14.4a. Each number 
is broken into a pair of factors. These factors are, 
in turn, broken down into pairs of factors until only 
prime factors remain. The prime factors of 24 are 2, 
2, 2, and 3 (2  2  2  3  24). The prime factors of 
36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3 (2  2  3  3  36). Once the 
two denominators are represented as prime factors, 
the LCM can be determined. The common factors of 
24 and 36 are 2, 2, and 3, as shown in Figure 14.4b. 
The LCM is found by taking the product of the com-
mon factors (2, 2, and 3) and the remaining factors 
of the two factor trees: 2 remains from the factors of 
24, and 3 remains from the factors of 36. Thus the 
LCM is 2  2  2  3  3, or 72.

tions for each addend and look for a common de-
nominator. This requires that students understand 
that equivalent fractions are found by multiplying a 
fraction by 1 expressed as 2
2 or 3
3 and so on.

72

Because 72 is the smallest multiple of 36 and 24, 72 
is the LCM. This same process can be used for the 
problem 3

The denominator 48 is the smallest multiple of both 
16 and 12, so 48 is the LCM. In each case, multiplying 
both the numerator and the denominator of these 
fractions by the same number has the same effect 
as multiplying by 1 ( 3
3  4
4  1).
Rods, tiles, or graph paper can be used to model 
this thinking. Figure 14.5 shows how rods can be 
used to ﬁ nd the LCM of 5 and 6. Notice that the 5 
rods are lined up alongside the 6 rods until the two 
trains of rods have exactly the same length. In this 
case the length of each of the rod trains is 30. The 
LCM for 6 and 5 is 30.
displayed in the area that the circles have in com-
mon, where they overlap. The LCM is the product 
of all factors shown (2  2  2  3  3  72). This 
approach visually clariﬁ es the factors that are com-
mon to each number and thus the factors that are 
part of any common denominator.
There is another beneﬁ t to representing the prime 
factors in a Venn diagram. Notice the common fac-
tors where the circles intersect. These factors (2, 2, 
3) are the factors of the greatest common factor 
(GCF; the common factor with the largest value). 
The GCF is useful when students are renaming frac-
tions in their lowest terms. For 24
36 the diagram shows 
that the GCF is 2  2  3, or 12. When 24 and 36 are 
each divided by 12, the resulting common fraction, 
2
3, is in its simplest form:
124  122
136  122  2
3
When both the numerator and the denominator 
of any fraction are divided by the same number—
in this case 12—it is the same as dividing by 1 
(12
12  1).
Some children will ﬁ nd appealing the “outside-
in” method for determining common factors of two 
numbers. To ﬁ nd the GCF for two numbers using the 
outside-in method, the ﬁ rst step is to ﬁ nd the small-
est factor (2) of one number (24) and write it with its 
matching factor (12):

Next, ﬁ nd the next largest factor (3) and its

Using a Calculator to Add 
Common Fractions
Modern calculators permit students to perform many 
operations easily and quickly. Students should leave 
elementary school knowing how to use a calcula-
tor to perform operations with whole numbers and 
common and decimal fractions, to simplify common 
fractions, to determine greatest common factors, and 
to determine averages (means). Children must have 
opportunities to learn to 
use calculators accurately 
and in appropriate ways 
and at appropriate times. 
You can integrate calcula-
tors into the curriculum so 
that children view them as 
a tool for computing and 
solving problems. For ex-
ample, when students learn to add and subtract com-
mon fractions using paper-and-pencil algorithms, 
they should learn to use a calculator to perform the 
same operations. Once children can use a calcula-
tor to perform operations, they need opportunities 
to practice and maintain their skills.
Interesting and entertaining learning and prac-
tice materials have been developed for this purpose. 
Producers of calculators and book publishers are 
sources of worthwhile activities. Some publications 
contain activities for a particular calculator; other 
publications apply to all calculators that have com-
mon functions. A World of Mathematics: Activities 
for Grades 4, 5, and 6 Using the TI-15 (Christ, 2000) 
is an example of a text designed to be used with 
a speciﬁ c calculator. However, the activities are 
easily adjusted to any fraction-capable calculator. 
Many books provide activities suitable for any four-
function calculator, such as Explorations: Integrat-
ing Hand-Held Technology into the Elementary Math-
ematics Classroom (Olson et al., 2002).
An activity from Activities for Casio FX-55 Frac-
tion Calculator (Casio, 1994) is an example of ma-
terial from a book designed to help children learn 
to use a calculator. The activity is a game for two 
or three in which children use a calcula tor to add 
common fractions and mixed numerals. The game 
provides practice in adding while encouraging chil-
dren to estimate sums before computing. To be suc-
cessful at the game, a player must have reasonable 
mathematical sense about common fractions.
Addition and Subtraction 
with Decimal Fractions
Students who have a good understanding of frac-
tional numbers and their decimal fraction represen-
tations generally experience little difﬁ culty learning 
to compute with decimal fractions because the al-
gorithms for decimals resemble the algorithms for 
whole numbers. Numerals are aligned by place-value 
positions in the standard algorithm when adding or 
subtracting with both whole numbers and decimal 
numbers, and computation is done one place-value 
position at a time, beginning with the position on 
the right. Everyday problems involving money or 
metric measurement, for example, help students to 
recognize situations that involve decimal fractions 
and to grasp the importance of understanding each 
John Venn (1834– 1923) was an English mathematician who 
used the circles known as Venn diagrams. Venn was not 
the ﬁ rst to use circles to represent mathematics concepts. 
Leonhard Euler (1707– 1783) used the same circle arrange-
ments more than a century earlier, but they were not used 
extensively until Venn’s application to modern algebra con-
cepts of British mathematicians. Venn was in the right place 
at the right time.

operation. Activity 14.9 illustrates addition settings 
with tenths and hundredths. A number line is used 
to model the ﬁ rst setting, and base-10 blocks are 
used for the second. Similarly, base-10 blocks can be 
used to represent subtraction in a fashion similar to 
what was done with whole numbers. Although sub-
traction with decimal fractions is done in the same 
way as subtraction with whole numbers, students 
still need to work with realistic situations that lead to 
subtraction. Activity 14.10 uses a calculator for early 
explorations of decimal addition with tenths.
Perhaps you learned the rule “When adding or 
subtracting decimals, line up the decimal points.” 
Students who follow this rule can set up any addi-
tion or subtraction problem involving decimals cor-
rectly, but they may not understand why the rule 
works. If students have worked with decimal materi-
als, blocks, or coins, they should understand that 
lining up the decimals really is aligning the place 
values. As the following problem shows, when deci-
mal fractions are aligned so that the decimal points 
line up, the rule ensures that, as with whole num-
bers, digits that are added together have the same 
place value. Thus tenths in each of the decimal frac-
tions are combined with each other and not with 
units or hundredths.

Lining up the place values also helps with the 
estimation of the answer by adding the whole num-
bers (2  4  25) or by rounding (2  4  1  26).
Multiplication with 
Common Fractions
The commonly used algorithm for multiplication of 
common fractions is deceptively easy for teachers 
to teach and children to use. Here is a set of rules 
presented in a book for teachers (Muschla & Mus-
chla, 1995, p. 25):
Multiplication of Fractions
1.  Multiply the numerators.
2.  Multiply the denominators.
3.  Simplify if possible.

Children who are taught rules for performing com-
putation with this algorithm can multiply pairs of 
fractional numbers with ease. However, if they com-
pute by rules alone, they will understand little of the 
meaning behind the computation and have difﬁ culty 
recalling the steps in the algorithm. Students need 
to explore the meaning of common fraction multi-
plication and division. Learning effective algorithms 
for multiplication and division should come from ex-
ploration of realistic situations modeled with learn-
ing materials. The ﬁ nal thing children should learn 
about multiplying and dividing fractional numbers 
is an effective algorithm. Teachers who adopt the 
philosophy of this book will use realistic situations 
and learning aids, not simply rules, as they explore 
with students the meanings of multiplying and di-

•  Begin with a problem: “Danielle earns pocket money by 
using her bicycle to do errands. She measures distances 
in kilometers with a metric odometer. For one errand she 
recorded the distances 0.7, 0.3, and 0.8 kilometers. How 
many kilometers did she ride for that errand?”
•  Discuss the meaning of the three numbers in the story 
and what is to be found. “What will you do to determine 
the answer?” (Answer: add the three numbers.)
•  Have students write a mathematical sentence for the situ-
ation on their individual chalkboards:
0.7  0.3  0.8  ?
•  Display the number line marked with tenths, and have a 
student mark the three stages of Danielle’s errand. Have 
the student tell how far she rode.
•  Write a vertical algorithm:

pounds of cheddar cheese. None of the packages showed 
a weight of 2 pounds, but Sara found a package with

viding with common fractions. Research has shown 
that “procedural knowledge should be developed 
on a foundation of conceptual understanding. . . . 
Once students understand a computational proce-
dure, practice will help them become conﬁ dent and 
competent in using it. But when students mimic a 
procedure without understanding it, it is difﬁ cult for 
them to go back later and build understanding” (Sut-
ton & Krueger, 2002, p. 81).
Multiplication with fractional numbers involves 
three situations: multiplying a common fraction by 
a whole number, multiplying a whole number by a 
common fraction, and multiplying a common frac-
tion by a common fraction. Figure 14.7 illustrates 
these three types of multiplication in situations suit-
able for use in elementary school. These and the 
problems in Activities 14.11 through 14.14 are exam-
ples to use with children.
Multiplying a Fractional Number 
by a Whole Number
One way to interpret multiplication is as repeated 
addition. With whole numbers the thinking is that 
there are a number of groups of a certain size—say, 
ﬁ ve groups of four apples; the answer, 20, is deter-
mined by adding 4 ﬁ ve times:
4  4  4  4  4  20 or 5  4  20
Repeated addition with common fractions uses the 
same thinking, except that the second factor is a 
common fraction. In the example in Figure 14.7a, 
MISCONCEPTION
As children learn to do multiplication with whole numbers, 
they see that the product is larger than either factor (except 
when 0 or 1 is a factor). Thus the rule “Multiplication makes 
bigger, division makes smaller” seems to be reasonable. Of 
course, such a rule is patently untrue when common frac-
tions are involved. For instance, when children multiply with 
common fractions between 0 and 1, they see that the product 
is smaller than either factor, except when 1 is a factor. This 
difference points to the need for careful development of un-
derstanding of multiplication with common fractions through 
the use of realistic situations, learning aids, and connections 
between this multiplication and multiplication with whole 
numbers.
ACTIVITY 14.10
 
Adding Common Decimals with a Calculator
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Pairs
Objective: Students develop regrouping when adding common 
decimal fractions.
Materials: Calculator, paper and pencils
•  Remind students how to perform repeated addition on a 
calculator by putting the following number sentence on 
the board: 2  2  ?.
•  Ask students to enter the sentence into the calculator, and 
be that sure all have the same result (4).
•  Now have students press the  key again. The reading 
should now be 6. Pressing the  key added 2 to the previ-
ous sum. Repeatedly striking the  key will add 2 to any 
previous sum.
•  Have students practice ﬁ nding 8  7 by performing re-
peated addition on 7 (7  7  7  . . .  56).
•  Now ask students to enter 0.2  0.2  into their cal-
culators. The result should be 0.4. Have students make 
repeated additions until they reach 0.8. Now ask students 
to speculate about the next reading when the  key is 
pressed. Have students press  and discuss the result. 
Many students will expect 0.10, not 1.0, as the result. 
Discuss why the result is 1.0.
•  Use 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, and 
0.5, and follow the 
same procedure. Do not 
stop with the ﬁ rst num-
ber to equal or exceed 
1.0; continue beyond 
5.0 for each example.
•  Ask students to write 
out the readings for 
the following sentence: 
0.6  0.6  ?, assum-
ing that the  key is 
pressed seven times. 
Students then check 
their work by using the 
calculator.

The connection between repeated addition with 
whole numbers and repeated addition with frac-
tional numbers can be made by engaging children 
in a lesson like the one in Activity 14.11:
1.  Oletha practices goal tending for her soccer 
team for 3
4 of an hour ﬁ ve nights a week. How 
many hours does she practice each week? 
(Answer: There are 5 three-quarter circles, each 
representing 3

represent 33

2.  Harold had 12 baseball trading cards. He traded 
3
4 of them for one Hank Aaron card. How many 
cards did he trade for the one card? (Answer: 
There are 12 cards. One-fourth of 12 is 3, so 
three-fourths of 12 is 9: 3
4  12  9.)
3.  Ben had 7
8 of a sheet of poster board. He used 1
4 
of the sheet for an art project. What part of the 
entire sheet did he use for the project? (Answer: 
Seven of the eight parts are bracketed to show 7
8. 
The seven eighths are cut into fourths, and one 
of the fourths is bracketed. One-fourth of seven-
eighths is 7

8  7
32.)
Multiplying a Whole Number 
by a Fractional Number
Many practical situations give rise to the need for 
multiplying a whole number by a fractional num -
ber. In Figure 14.7b the baseball card setting is this 
type. Figure 14.8 illustrates other common examples: 
one-quarter of a block of butter weighs one-fourth of 
a pound, so the weight is 1
4 of 16 ounces, or 4 ounces. 
One-third of a foot is the same as 1
3 of 12 inches, or 
4 inches; one-half of a dollar is 1
2 of 100 pennies, or 
50 cents. Frequent encounters with these and simi-
lar applications enhance children’s understanding 
of the practical uses of this multiplication. Activity 
14.12 presents a whole-class lesson dealing with this 
type of multiplication. Eventually, students learn 
that multiplication of a whole number by a common 
fraction—for example, 2
3  18—can be completed 
by either of the following algorithm procedures:
2  18
3  36
3  12

Multiplying a Fractional Number

Multiplying a fractional number by a fractional 
number is the most difﬁ cult for students to visual-
ize and understand. Care must be taken to ensure 
that meanings are clear. The poster board problem

tional situations that provide a connection between 
the real world and multiplying one common frac-
tion by another:
•  A popcorn-ball recipe uses 3
4 of a cup of sugar. If 
only 1
2 of a recipe is prepared, how much sugar is 
used?
•  Rosie had 3
4 of a pound of ground beef. When she 
used 1
3 of it for a burger, how much ground beef 
was in her burger?
•  Mas spends 11
2 hours doing homework each eve-
ning, He does 1
2 of his homework before dinner 
and 1
2 after dinner. How much time does he work 
before dinner? after dinner?
These problems can all be solved quickly us-
ing a memorized algorithm such as the one in the 
teacher’s book referred to earlier. The algorithm 
for the ﬁ rst problem (3
4  1
2) suggests the following 
solution:
Multiply the numerators: 
3  1  3
Multiply the denominators: 
4  2  8
3
4   1
2  3
8
When students memorize a rote procedure such 
as this, no matter how simple, they lose a concep-
tual understanding of the process involved and re-
tain little number sense about whether the solution 
they obtain is reasonable. We strongly recommend 
that students need experiences such as Activity 
14.12 and 14.13 before they begin to apply any for-
mal algorithms.
Understanding the meaning of multiplication 
of two fractional numbers can be developed with 
a presentation using real objects and an overhead 
projector. Figure 14.9 illustrates a plan for a lesson to 
develop the concept. Note that this lesson does not 
introduce the algorithm. (The same scheme could 
be used with small groups of students if enough 
ingredients and other materials are on hand, so 
children could measure and work out answers for 
themselves.)
Once the children show that they can visualize 
situations involving multiplication of two common 
fractions and understand their meanings, an algo-
rithm can be introduced. Raise questions that cause 
children to think about the new multiplication and 
its relationship to concepts they already know. For 
example:
•  What is different about this multiplication com-
pared to multiplication with common fractions 
that we’ve already done? (Answer: Here we are 
multiplying two common fractions. Before we had 
one common fraction and a whole number.)
•  Do you think we can use the same algorithm as be-
fore for this type of multiplication? Let’s see. (Write 
algorithms for the recipe changes with answers.)

Multiplying a Fraction by a Whole Number (Reasoning and Proof)
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students develop strategies and an algorithm for multi-
plying a common fraction by a whole number.
Materials: Common fraction manipulatives, common fraction 
number lines, paper and pencils
•  Give each team a printed copy of the following problem: 
“Sarah practices ballet for three-quarters of an hour each 
day. How many hours does she practice in a week?”
•  Teams share work in a modiﬁ ed roundtable format. In this 
format the ﬁ rst team member reads the problem and con-
ducts a discussion about its meaning. The second member 
chooses a concrete learning aid appropriate for solving 
the problem. The third uses the learning aid to represent 
the problem, and the fourth member solves the problem 
with the learning aid.
•  One child might select circular pieces from a common 
fraction kit. The child who represents the problem sets up 
7 three-quarter circles. The child who solves the problem 
combines the circles to show that Sarah practices for 51
4 
hours in a week.
•  Another child might select a number line. The child who 
represents the problem marks off 7 three-quarter jumps 
and the child who determines the answer converts 21
4  to 
51
4 hours.
•  Present the following three additional problems for groups 
to solve. Members rotate functions until each one has 
performed each function.
•  “Flora has 6 pieces of candy. Each weighs 5
6 of an ounce. 
What is the total weight of the candy?”
•  “Jam will use 2
3 foot of framing material for each side 
of a square picture. How much framing material will he 
need for two pictures?”
•  “The oval track at Wilson School is 1
4 mile around. Hark 
ran ﬁ ve laps around the track. How far did she run?”
•  When children have completed all four problems, discuss 
the various ways that they solved each one. Lead children 
to recognize that each problem can be solved by repeated 
addition.
•  Write an addition sentence for each problem:

•  Add the numerators in the addition sentences. Compare 
answers with the answers that children arrived at using 
learning aids. Connect this addition to repeated addition 
with whole numbers. Discuss the way in which repeated 
addition and multiplication are related.
•  Have children name a multiplication sentence for each

•  Guide children to note that multiplying the whole number 
by the numerator and writing the product over the de-
nominator yields the answer. The answer can be con-
verted to a whole number or whole number and fraction.

Materials: Sets of 24 individual objects (disks, plastic animals, etc.) 
for each child; 2-foot loops of colored string or yarn, several per 
child
•  Say: “I want each of you to use your disks to make a 
3  6 array.” Monitor to check for accuracy. Have the 
students recall a multiplication sentence for this array: 
3  6  18.
•  Say: “I want each of you to put a 
loop of yarn around one-third of 
your array.” Monitor for accuracy.
•  Discuss the fact that to determine 
one-third of the set, it is necessary 
•  to think in terms of three equal-size subgroups. Each 
subgroup is one-third of the entire set of disks, so 1
3 of 18 
is 6. Write the multiplication sentence 1
3  18  6 on the 
chalkboard.
•  “Now I want you to move your 
loop to show how many disks are in 
two-thirds of the array.” Monitor for 
accuracy.
•  Write a sentence for this situation: 
2
3  18  12.
•  Repeat with another set that can be separated into equal-
size sets without remainders, such as 3
4 of 16, 2
5 of 20, and 
5
6 of 12.
•  Provide guided practice by having students work in pairs/
check format to complete these examples. Alternatively, 
one child uses markers and string to solve a problem while 
the other checks the work.

•  How is the multiplication completed with the 
algorithm? (Answer: The numerator of one frac-
tion is multiplied by the numerator of the other 
fraction, the denominator of one fraction is 
multiplied by the denominator of the other, 
and the two products form another common 
fraction.)

When the ingredients in a recipe are increased, 
multiplication with mixed numerals can occur. If a 
recipe that includes 11
2 cups of sugar is doubled to 
make a larger cake, then 3 cups of sugar is needed. 
When that same recipe is increased 21
2 times, the 
amount of sugar must be increased 21
2 times. Activ-
ity 14.14 shows one way to introduce multiplication 
with mixed numerals. The ﬁ rst and second steps in 
this activity provide a base from which to solve the 
third and fourth steps.
Once the recipe is doubled (from 18 to 36 serv-
ings), the amount needed for 45 servings can be 
determined by ﬁ nding 1

ingredient and adding it to the doubled amount. 
Children who recognize this can complete much of 
the work mentally.
Before introducing an algorithm for multiplying 
with mixed numerals, spend some time reviewing 
the process of changing mixed numerals to com-
mon fractions. Ask questions such as “How many 
halves in 21

Multiplying with Mixed Numerals
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students develop strategies for multiplying pairs of 
mixed numerals.
Materials: Jigsaw cards (explained in activity), lemon soufﬂ é recipe, 
paper and pencils
•  Give each team of four students a copy of the lemon 
soufﬂ é recipe:
16 eggs
21
3 cup sugar
3
4 teaspoon salt
9 tablespoons lemon juice
grated rind of 1
2 lemon
3
4 tablespoon vanilla
This recipe serves 18 people.
•  Explain the jigsaw problem-solving cooperative-learning 
format. Four clues for solving a problem are distributed 
to a team, one to each child. The problem for this activity 
is: “One soufﬂ é made from the recipe serves 18 people. 
How much of each ingredient will you need to make 
enough soufﬂ é to serve 45 people?”
Clue 1: If you want to make enough soufﬂ é for 36 people, 
how do you determine the quantity of each ingredient?
Clue 2: Determine the quantity of each ingredient when 
you double the recipe.
Clue 3: By how much will you increase the ingredients to 
make enough soufﬂ é to serve 9 more people, for a total 
of 45 people?
Clue 4: What is the total amount of each ingredient?
•  Children discuss and solve the clues in order, making cer-
tain that each one understands their meaning.
•  Call on team members to explain their work.
Hot Rods: “We used markers to represent eggs. We 
counted out 16 eggs for one recipe and 16 more for a 
second recipe. That’s enough for 36 people. We needed 
enough eggs for 9 more people. Eight is 1
2 of 16, so we 
counted 8 more markers; that made 40 eggs in all.”
16 eggs for 18 people
16 eggs for 18 people

Go Getters: “We used a measuring cup and sand to de-
termine the amount of sugar. First, we ﬁ lled a measuring 
cup to show 2 cups and poured that into a bowl. Then we 
measured 1
3 and put that in the bowl. That was enough 
sugar for soufﬂ é that serves 18 people. We did that a sec-
ond time, and had enough sugar for 36 people. Then we 
measured 1 cup, that’s half of 2, and then measured 1
2 of 
1
3. That gave us 1
6 cup or enough for 9 more servings. 
When we added everything together, we had 21

Note that the distributive property for multiplica-

situations. Associate each of the other sentences 
with the models children used to solve a part of the

multiplying mixed numerals. Point to the ﬁ rst sen-
tence and ask: “How many halves in 21

this is now a whole number multiplied by a common

is 40. The other algorithms should be completed in 
the same way.

In addition to using models and real-life applica-

tion, as suggested in the discussion of Activity 14.14. 
When children read the problem 21
2  31
4  ?, they 
will read “two and one-half, three and one-fourth.” 
This correct reading of the mixed numerals clearly 
indicates that there are two numbers represented 
in each mixed numeral, a whole number and a 
fractional number. Thus the expanded notation for 
this problem is simply a recognition of this already 
known fact. The original problem can be written in 
expanded notation as follows:

MISCONCEPTION
When working with multiplication of mixed numerals with 
children, it is helpful to know that some children typically 
want to multiply mixed numerals as follows:
Can you tell what the error is? The student multiplied the whole 
numbers (2  3  6) and then multiplied the fractional numbers 
(1
2  1
4  1
8). Why might children use such a strategy? Many 
factors could explain why this incorrect method is used, but 
one reason is that children carry over the rules for addition 
and subtraction with mixed numerals to work multiplication. 
While learning addition and subtraction, children ﬁ rst add 
(or subtract) the fractional numbers and the whole numbers 
separately. Children bring the same reasoning to multiplica-
tion of mixed numerals.

This review sets the stage for doing the same 
thing in the algorithms. Following discussion of the

ematical sentence for each part:

The resulting expanded notation algorithm can be

children develop an intuitive base on which to build

common fractions can be introduced. Activity 14.16 
is an introductory lesson dealing with partitive divi-
sion with common fractions.

Create a story problem for a measurement situation 
and one for a partitive situation that could be used

Developing Understanding 
of Division Algorithms
As mentioned earlier, in the elementary grades work 
with division involving common fractions helps 
children develop an intuitive understanding of algo-
rithms involving these numbers. Two algorithms are 
used for dividing with common fractions. One is the 
common denominator algorithm, and the other is 
the invert-and-multiply algorithm. Both can be de-
veloped intuitively by following discovery lessons 
such as those in Activities 14.15 and 14.16.
Examples illustrate the measurement situations 
in Figure 14.11 to suggest a way to introduce the 
common fraction algorithm:

as 12

(Answer: 4.) Rename 2

there?” (Answer: 10.) Rename 5

Students may have used a similar expanded notation with 
multiplication of whole numbers:
16  32  (10  30)  (10  2)  (6  30)  (6  2)  300 
 20  180  12  512.
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
Students can draw on their cultural background when devel-
oping word problems and contexts for fractional problems. 
For example, when recipes are the context, students can use 
recipes for ethnic dishes.
In comparison to the expanded notation method, 
the familiar algorithm for multiplying mixed numer-
als is efﬁ cient. Both mixed numerals are renamed as 
a single fractional number; then the two fractional 
numbers are multiplied to complete the algorithm. 
Thus the original problem can be solved as follows, 
using the familiar algorithm shown here:

Division with Common Fractions
Division with fractional numbers arises from the 
same two settings as division with whole num-
bers—namely, repeated subtraction (measurement) 
and sharing (partitive) settings. The examples in 
Figure 14.11 illustrate measurement and partitive set-
tings for division involving common fractions that 
are suitable for elementary students. Students can 
model these and other problems using fraction ma-
nipulatives or drawings.
Students’ early experiences should include prob-
lem-solving work for which they devise solutions. 
The purpose of early activities is not to teach an al-
gorithm (“invert and multiply”) but to help students

These measurement problems illustrate repeated subtraction situations. Each can be solved by subtracting the number that is the
divisor until zero or an amount less than the divisor is reached, then counting the number of times it was subtracted.
These partitive problems are “What is the size of each part?” situations. Each can be solved by dividing the quantities or objects
into a number of equal-size parts and naming the size of each part.

divisor as common fractions having the same de-
nominator, if necessary. Divide the ﬁ rst numerator 
by the second numerator, then divide the ﬁ rst de-
nominator by the second denominator. Rename the 
quotient as a whole number or mixed numeral.
The invert-and-multiply algorithm is based on 
the idea that dividing one number by another is the 
same as multiplying the number by the reciprocal of 
the divisor. We use examples from Activity 14.15 to 
illustrate a way to develop an intuitive understand-
ing of this algorithm. Recall with children the paper- 
folding work they did to determine answers to such 
questions as “When a half piece of paper is folded 
in half, what is the size of each of the two pieces?”

1

There are few occasions when individuals com-

Calculators simplify the task. Operations with calcu-

this chapter. Whether you go beyond an intuitive de-
velopment of either or both algorithms to have chil-
dren develop paper-and-pencil skills with them will 
depend on goals for the setting in which you teach. 
If your local mathematics standards require children 
to learn and apply the standard algorithms, do not 
neglect the necessary foundational work described 
earlier as activities that lead to the algorithms. Pro-

As children’s sense for numbers grows, so does their
skill in estimating and judging the reasonableness
of answers. Teachers play a role in helping children
develop a sense about numbers. During study with 
fraction strips and number lines, ask questions about 
fractions that are near 0, near 1
2, and near 1. Build on 
this knowledge to help children think about opera-
tions with common fractions and judge the reason-
ableness of their own answers. Use questions such as 
these as children learn the four operations:
•  When you add 1
3 and 1
4, will the sum be less than, 
equal to, or more than 1? Why?
•  When you add 1
2 and 3
4, will the sum be less than, 
equal to, or more than 1? Why?
•  When you add 2
3 and 1
4, the sum will be about what 
number? Why?
•  The sum for a pair of fractions is between 1
2 and 1. 
Is the pair 1
3 and 1
4, 1
8 and 1
6, or 2
3 and 1? Why?
•  When you subtract a pair of common fractions, 
will the answer be less than or more than 1? Why?
•  When you determine 1
2 of 12, will the answer be 
more than or less than 12? Why?
•  When you divide 12 by 1
2, will the quotient be 
more than or less than 12? Why?
•  When you divide 1
4 by 2, will the quotient be more 
than or less than 1
4? Why?
•  When you divide 1
2 by 1
4, will the quotient be more 
than or less than 1? Why?
•  When you divide 1
2 by 3
4, will the quotient be less 
than or more than 1? Why?
Another aspect of number sense with common 
fractions is the ability to compute mentally. You 
should encourage children to become comfortable 
with doing much of their computation without paper 
and pencil. When children add or subtract simple 
combinations, such as 1
2  1
4 or 1
3  1
6, do not require 
that they show all their computations with paper 
and pencil. Those who can think “1
2 plus 1
4 is 2
4 plus 
1
4, or 3
4” and “1
3 minus 1
6 is 2
6 minus 1
6, or 1
6” should be al-
lowed to record the sum or difference without writ-
ten computation. The same holds true for multiplica-
tion and division. However, asking children to show 
computations on occasion serves as an assessment 
of their understanding of algorithms. Standardized 
tests that students are required to take at the end of 
certain grade levels in some states include algorith-
mic computation, so children should maintain skill 
with each algorithm they learn.
“Thinking aloud” about procedures for multipli-
cation and division of fractional numbers helps stu-
dents develop mental computation skills:
•  There are 240 students in a school. Three-fourths 
of them arrive by bus each day. How many are 
bused to school? Help students to think, “One-
fourth of 240 is 60, so three-fourths will be 3 times 
60, or 180. That means 180 are bused to school.”
•  There are 40 pounds of cheese in a round. How 
many 1
4-pound pieces can be cut from the round? 
Help students to think, “There are 4 quarter-
pound pieces in 1 pound, so there will be 40 
times 4 pieces, or 160, in the round.”
E X E RC I S E
Discuss the validity of the rule “Division makes 
smaller.” •••
Renaming Fractions 
in Simpler Terms
A common practice in the past was to have students 
rename every fraction answer in its simplest form. 
Answers were often considered wrong if they could 
be but had not been “reduced to lowest terms,” even 
when all other aspects of the work were correct. A 
simple example where this rule violates good prac-
tice is in check writing. When a check is written for 
a purchase costing $78.95, the cent part is written as 
95
100, not 19
20. In keeping with the philosophy that stu-
dents should understand what they are doing, it is 
better that they consider the nature of each problem 
before they make a decision about renaming an an-
swer. Consider these two examples:
•  Pedro’s father uses ﬁ ne gold wire to make jewelry. 
The jewelry wire costs $5.00 per quarter inch. One 
day he purchased one piece of wire that was 31
4 
inches long and another that was 41
4 inches long. 
What is the total length of the two pieces? What 
was the cost of the wire?
In this problem precision of measurement is impor-
tant because the price is based on quarter-inch seg-
ments. It is necessary to know how many quarter-
E

inches are purchased in order to determine the cost. 
Retaining 72
4 inches as the answer reﬂ ects the nature 
of the situation; renaming it as 71
2 inches does not. To 
solve the problem, the sum can be renamed as 30
4 ; 30 
times 5 shows that the cost of the wire is $150.00.
•  There were 291
4 yards of cloth on a bolt. How 
much is left after a customer purchases 23
4 yards 
of the cloth?
In this case the answer 262
4 can be renamed as 
261
2 because cloth is sold by the yard and precision is 
not signiﬁ cant. Discussions that help students make 
decisions about how to treat common fractions in 
answers should replace the practice of having them 
rename every answer in simplest terms.
During early work with fraction models and 
number lines, children learn that there are equiva-
lent classes of fractions, such as 1
2, 2
4, 3
6, and 4
8. As their 
understanding matures, they easily rename 1
2 as 2
4, 
1
3 as 2
6, and 4
8 as 2
4 or 1
2. It is when common fractions 
become larger that children see that renaming is not 
so easily done.
Discussion of the process can begin with simple 
examples:
1
2  2
4  
2
3  4
6  
4
8  12
24

10  16
40
Point out that the numerator and the denominator 
in 2
4 are two times as large as in 1
2. Ask: “How much 
larger are the numerator and denominator in 4
6 than 
in 2
3?” (Answer: two times as large.) “How much 
larger are they in the third example?” (Answer: three 
times as large.) “In the fourth example?” (Answer: 
four times as large.) “Can you name a rule for chang-
ing a common fraction so that it is in higher terms?” 
(Answer: Multiply the numerator and denominator 
by the same number.) Point out that this is the same 
as multiplying by 1:

Changing to lower terms (simplifying) is the inverse 
of changing to higher terms, so you can reverse the 
process to rename the common fractions in simpler 
terms:
   2
4  1  2
4  2

Discuss the rule: To rename a common fraction in 
simpler terms, divide both the numerator and the 
denominator by the same number.
Multiplying and Dividing 
with Decimal Fractions
Multiplying with Decimal Fractions
Work with decimal fractions in the early years is 
conﬁ ned to developing understanding of the nu-
merals. Later, children learn about addition and 
subtraction with them. In higher grades they learn 
processes for multiplying and dividing with decimal 
fractions. Because fractional numbers expressed as 
decimal fractions can be multiplied using the same 
algorithm as when whole numbers are multiplied, 
teachers must guard against having the process be-
come mechanical for students. Unless conceptual 
knowledge is developed along with procedural 
knowledge, children’s understanding is shallow. A 
number of practical applications of multiplication 
with decimal fractions are relevant for elementary 
school children. The examples in Activities 14.17 
and 14.18 can be used to foster children’s thinking 
about multiplication with decimal fractions.
Multiplication of decimal fractions involves mul-
tiplying a decimal fraction by a whole number, a 
whole number by a decimal fraction, or a decimal 
fraction by a decimal fraction. Activity 14.17 shows 
a way to introduce multiplication of a decimal frac-
tion by a whole number. Whole-class lessons pres-
ent situations involving multiplication of a whole 
number by a decimal fraction (see the companion 
website activity “Multiplying a Whole Number by a 
Decimal Fraction”) and a decimal fraction by a deci-
mal fraction (see Activity 14.18). Estimation is also 
an important part of helping children make sense of 
multiplication with decimal fractions.
After students understand the meaning of the 
three multiplication settings, they will be ready to 
learn an algorithm. The commonly used algorithm

ACTIVITY 14.17
 
Multiplying a Decimal by a Whole Number
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students develop strategies and an algorithm for multi-
plying a decimal fraction by a whole number.
Materials: No speciﬁ c materials; students may select from materi-
als center, use diagrams, or do all work mentally or with paper 
and pencil.
•  Present the following four numbered problems, one for 
each team member.
1.  Josie is repairing her railroad track layout. She needs 
six pieces of wire, each 0.6 of a meter long. How 
much wire does she need for her layout?
2.  Onterrio paid $0.49 each for eight cans of corn. 
What was the total cost of the corn?
3.  Marty has four bags of dog food, each weighing 
0.75 of a kilogram. What is the total weight of the 
dog food?
4.  A restaurant recipe uses 1.5 liters of milk for each 
bowl of pancake batter. How much milk is used to 
make 15 bowls of batter?
•  Distribute a copy of each problem to each team. Team 
members decide which member will solve which problem. 
Each team member chooses a method by which to work 
and solves the problem. Members who ﬁ nish ﬁ rst may 
coach other members.
•  Teams discuss their solutions.
•  On a signal, the children who worked problem 1, those 
who worked problem 2, those who worked problem 3, 
and those who worked problem 4 assemble in groups to 
share their work.
•  Students return to desks for a discussion of the problems. 
Points to bring out during the discussion should include 
the following :
•  Each of these problems can be solved by repeated addi-
tion. For example:
0.6  0.6  0.6  0.6  0.6  0.6  ?
or 6  0.6  ?
•  Estimation helps determine the reasonableness of some 
answers. When $0.49 is rounded to $0.50, 8 times 50 
indicates that the answer will be around $4.00. An an-
swer of $39.60 or $0.3960 is not a reasonable answer.
•  Multiplication with decimal fractions is done the same 
way as multiplication with whole numbers.
•  Numbers can be renamed from decimal fractions to 
common fractions to solve some problems mentally. 
Thus 0.75 can be renamed 3

ACTIVITY 14.18
 
Multiplying a Decimal Fraction by a Decimal Fraction
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students develop strategies for multiplying a decimal 
fraction by a decimal fraction.
Materials: Two transparencies, each with a square marked to show 
tenths; light-colored marking pens; wiping cloth
•  Explain this situation: “Art foil 
comes in sheets that are 10 centi-
meters square.” Place one of the 
transparent squares on the projec-
tor, with the lines vertical. “I am 
going to color 0.7 of this square, 
which represents a sheet of foil.” 
Color 7 tenths.
•  “If I cut off 0.3 of the 7 tenths for 
an art project, how much of the 
original sheet will I cut off?” Place 
the second transparency on top 
of the ﬁ rst with lines crosswise. 
Shade 3 tenths of it.
•  Point out that the answer is represented by the 21 parts 
that are shaded twice. Each of the 21 parts represents one 
of the 100 parts into which the entire unit was separated, 
so the product is 0.21.
•  Write and complete the multiplication sentence 0.3  0.7 
 0.21.
•  Relate this multiplication to working with percent by alter-
ing the problem: “A store advertised a 30% reduction in 
the cost of 70 cent ballpoint pens. What was the amount 
of the reduction for each pen?” Discuss how this problem 
is like the original problem. (Answer: 30% is the same as 
0.3, $0.70 is the same as 0.7.) Help children see that mul-
tiplying 0.7 by 0.3 is one way to determine the amount of 
reduction for the sale.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
is the same for this multiplication as for multiply-
ing whole numbers. Once children recognize this, 
they need meaningful ways to determine where to 
place the decimal point in each product. One way 
to determine where to place the decimal point is to 
round decimal fractions to whole numbers, then es-
timate products. For example, when 0.9 and 2.1 are 
multiplied, the product is 181 without the decimal 
point. By rounding 0.9 to 1 and 2.1 to 2, an estimated 
product is 2. When considering where to place the 
decimal point, 1.81 is the only reasonable response; 
18.1 is far too large and 0.181 is much too small.
The product of 23.2 times 1.95 is 45240 without 
the decimal point. By rounding 23.2 to 20 and 1.95 
to 2 and multiplying 2 times 20, an estimated answer 
of 40 is obtained. Where should the decimal point 
be placed in 45240 to reﬂ ect the estimated answer 
of 40?
It is not always possible to round decimal frac-
tions smaller than 1 to make estimates. A different 
strategy is needed for estimating answers to exam-
ples of multiplication such as 0.46 times 0.23. This 
strategy uses knowledge that decimal fractions can 
be renamed as common fractions, and vice versa. 
To estimate a product for 0.46 times 0.23, use the 
thought process shown in Figure 14.12. An alterna-
tive way to think about this problem is shown in 
Figure 14.13. Exercises containing examples such as 
those in Figure 14.14 can be given to students for 
practice in making decisions about where to place 
decimal points in products.
Dividing with Decimal Fractions
Students’ understanding of division with decimal 
fractions is enhanced by connecting the new work to 
division with whole numbers. Students need to see 
that the same two situations prevail for division with 
decimal fractions as for division with whole num-
bers: determining the size of each group when a set 
is divided into a given number of groups (partitive 
division) or ﬁ nding the number of groups when a set 
is divided into groups of a given size (measurement 
division). The same algorithm can be used for divi-
sion with decimal fractions as for whole numbers. 
The new element for students is placement of a deci-
mal point in the quotient. As with other new topics, 
this division should be introduced in relevant set-
tings and with meaningful materials. Activity 14.19 
suggests procedures that can be used.
Introduce the division algorithm for each prob-
lem following an activity like the one in Activity 
14.19. Relate numerals in each algorithm to action 
with models. In part a of the equations, segments 
of a 0.3-meter cord were cut; there were eight seg-
ments, with a 0.1-meter piece of cord left over. In 
part b, each of the eight parts into which the cord 
was cut is approximately 0.3 meter long. For this 
activity it is not necessary to carry division beyond 
the tenths place. Later, you may want to extend the 
division beyond tenths (part c) as a way to indicate 
a more precise measurement.

Figure 14.12 Estimating decimal products in terms of 
common fractions

Estimation is one way to determine where to 
place the decimal point in many quotients. To 
estimate the quotient for a pair of numbers, as in 
the sentence 29.52  6  ?, students should think, 
“29.52 can be rounded to 30; 30 divided by 6 equals 
5, so 29.52 divided by 6 will be about 5.” When the 
quotient is determined, students should place the 
decimal point to make the answer 4.92. Discuss ex-
amples such as the following to help students make 
estimates for putting a decimal point in the correct 
place:
 
69  0.3  230
 
811.8  22  369
 
20.74  3.4  61
Students who estimate their answers before using 
their algorithm can readily recognize any errors 
they might make when placing the decimal point in 
the quotient. Activity 14.20 assesses students’ ability 
to perform operations with common and decimal 
fractions.
Relating Common Fractions 
to Decimal Fractions
One last topic to be considered is the relationship 
between common and decimal fractions. Certainly 
students should view both representations as nam-
ing fractional numbers. Converting decimal frac-
tions to common fractions is fairly straightforward, 
especially if children are accustomed to reading 
decimal fractions as we suggest. For example, 0.45 
should be read as forty-ﬁ ve hundredths. When chil-
dren read decimal fractions this way, it is a simple 
task to convert the decimal fraction to its common 
fraction ( 45
100).
Converting common fractions to decimal frac-
tions can be a bit more challenging. Certainly some 
common fractions are easily represented as decimal 
fractions. Many common fractions can be written as

Decimal representations of these and other common 
fractions are terminating decimals. When such a 
fraction is converted to a decimal with the division 
algorithm, the quotient eventually terminates. Many 
fractions do not have terminating decimal represen-
tations. Their decimal representations are repeating 
decimals that extend inﬁ nitely. Activity 14.21 pres-
ents students with the opportunity to use calculators 
to explore the nature of terminating ( 1

repeating decimal representations of common frac-
tions (e.g., 1

Measurement and Partitive Division
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students develop a strategy for dividing with decimal 
fractions.
Materials: 2.5-meter lengths of cotton cord, two pieces for each 
pair of children; meterstick, marking pen, and scissors for each 
pair of children; printed copies of the two problems
•  Give each pair of students a copy of the following two 
problems, along with the other materials. Instruct them to 
read the problems and proceed to solve them.
1.  Juanita has a cord that is 2.5 meters long. She will 
cut pieces that are 0.3 meter long to make ties for a 
volleyball net. How many ties will she have?
2.  Leong has a cord that is 2.5 meters long. He will cut 
eight equal-size pieces for ties on a volleyball net. 
How long will each tie be?
•  Tell the children that they will work in a pairs/check 
format. Each pair on a team will use materials from the 
bag and a meterstick to solve each of the problems. (The 
scissors are for cutting the cord.) When both pairs on a 
team are ﬁ nished, the pairs compare their work and clear 
up any discrepancies.
•  When all pairs are ﬁ nished, collect the printed prob-
lems with answers from each pair. Discuss the problems 
and their solutions. If you ﬁ nd answers that are not in 
agreement, call on team members to explain their work. 
(Disregard minor differences caused by irregularities in 
measuring or rounding numbers.)
•  Discussion should reveal that the ﬁ rst problem is a mea-
surement type problem (How many pieces of a given size 
are there?) and that the second is a partitive type problem 
(What is the size of each piece?).
•  Point out that as they cut the cord for the ﬁ rst problem, 
they removed, or subtracted, 0.3 meter with each cut until 
only a too-small piece remained. Show this with repeated 
subtraction:
2.5  0.3  2.2
2.2  0.3  1.9
1.9  0.3  1.6
1.6  0.3  1.3
1.3  0.3  1.0
1.0  0.3  0.7
0.7  0.3  0.4
0.4  0.3  0.1
•  There are eight subtractions. Write the division sentence:
2.5  0.3  8 and a remainder
•  When the students cut the second cord, they marked and 
cut eight equal-size pieces. Write the division sentence for 
this problem:
2.5  8  0.3 (approximately)
•  Discuss reasons why the answer is recorded no more pre-
cisely than tenths. (Answer: It was not possible to fold and 
cut the cord precisely. A meterstick is not precise enough 
to determine a measurement beyond tenths.)

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving

Using a Calculator to Develop 
Understanding of Decimal 
Fractions
One of the ﬁ rst calculator activities is learning how 
to enter whole numbers. Students learn that to enter 
the number 243, for example, they have to enter the 
numerals 2, 4, and 3 in that order. Students should 
be able to enter decimal fractions in a similar fash-
ion. The ﬁ rst calculator activity that follows provides 
an interesting way to practice this skill. The second 
activity is the game of Wipeout played with decimal 
fractions. The third and fourth activities deal with 
estimating products and quotients while computing 
with decimal fractions.
•  Write each of the following decimal number 
words and decimal numerals on the chalkboard, 
or duplicate them for distribution to students:
two and ﬁ ve-tenths 
 sixty-one and 
forty-hundredths
four and three-tenths 
 seventy-ﬁ ve and

for the words in the ﬁ rst list into a calculator, pushing 
the  key after each entry. The numbers will have 
been read and entered correctly if the sum equals 
the decimal fraction at the bottom of the list. Repeat 
with the second list.
•  The game of Wipeout was introduced earlier 
when it was played with whole numbers. Now 
it is played with decimal fractions. The object is 
to wipe out a number in a particular place-value 
position in one move. For example, when shown 
the number 23.42, students are to wipe out the 4 
in the tenths position in one subtraction. To do 
this, students must know that the “4” represents 4 
tenths and that it can be wiped out by subtracting 
0.4 from 23.42. The tenths are wiped out, leaving 
23.02.
Write numbers such as the following on the chalk-
board, or have them on cards for each pair of 
students:
Wipe Out 
Wipe Out 
Wipe Out
Tenths 
Hundredths 
Thousandths
62.6 
23.45 
61.304
21.934 
23.59 
22.498
43.186 
52.092 
324.987
Variation: Have students use a 0– 9 spinner to gener-
ate numbers to wipe out. Each player gets four spins 
to get as close to 0 as possible in each place-value 
position.
•  In this activity students ﬁ rst use estimation to 
determine the placement of the decimal point in 
each answer. Then have students compute the an-
swers with a calculator to check their estimations.

Exploring Terminating and Repeating Decimals
Level: Grades 5– 6
Setting: Student pairs
Objective: Students will distinguish between terminating and 
repeating decimals.
Materials: Calculator
•  Post the fraction 1
8 on the board. Demonstrate how to use 
the calculator to convert 1
8 to a decimal fraction.
•  Repeat for 1
3.
•  Ask students to compare their two results. Probe for stu-
dents to recognize the difference between repeating and 
terminating decimals.
•  Ask students to use their calculators to represent the fol-
lowing fractions as decimals and then to categorize the 
results as either terminating or repeating: 1
2, 1
3, 1
4, 1
5, 1

•  Ask student pairs to determine what common fractions 
produce terminating decimals.
•  After a short time suggest that students write the denom-
inator of the fraction as prime factors. Students will then 
observe that if the denominator of a fraction is composed 
of only 2 and 5 as primes, then it will terminate.

Using Calculators 
with Common Fractions
Three calculators with capabilities to perform opera-
tions with common fractions are the Sharp EL-500L, 
the Texas Instruments TI-15, and the Casio FX-55. 
With each of these calculators a student can enter 
and simplify common fractions, convert from com-
mon fractions to decimal fractions and vice versa, 
and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division.
Simplifying Common Fractions. Children use re-
gions, fraction strips, and number lines to deal with 
groups of related common fractions, such as 1
2, 2
4, 3
6, 
and so on, which are all names for one-half. This 
and every other equivalence class have a common 
fraction that is in simplest form.
Once students understand the idea that each 
given part of a region or point on a line has many 
names, they can use calculators to identify the sim-
plest form for any common fraction. For example, 
given the common fraction 2
4, what is the simplest 
form? This is one that students will know to be 1
2. 
What about 48
96? The fact that its simplest form is also 
1
2 may not be readily apparent.
Converting from Common to Decimal Frac-
tions and Vice Versa. Each calculator is capable 
of converting a common fraction to a decimal frac-
tion, and vice versa. On the Casio and the TI-15, the 
key marked F-D renames a fractional number from 
one form to the other. The common fraction 7
8 is re-
named 0.875 when F-D is pressed; the same key re-
names 0.875 as 7
8. The Sharp calculator operates dif-
ferently. It uses the 2nd Deg key to change from one 
form to another. When the common fraction mode 
is being used, a number appears as 7
8. The numeral 
is renamed 0.875 by changing to the decimal frac-
tion mode.
Computing with Common Fractions. Children 
who understand the meaning of problem situations 
that require one or another of the operations and 
who can compute with paper-and-pencil algorithms 
are ready to use calculators to compute with com-
mon fractions. A calculator is faster and more accu-
rate than paper-and-pencil computation.
The three calculators mentioned (EL-500L, TI-15, 
and FX-55) do not perform the four operations in 
identical ways, but each begins an operation in the 
same way: Enter the ﬁ rst common fraction, press the 
operation key, enter the second common fraction, 
and press the  key. The differences lie in the dis-
play that unfolds as an operation is performed.
•  On the TI-15 the ﬁ rst common fraction appears 
as it is entered, the  sign appears when it is 
pushed, and the second common fraction ap-
pears when it is entered. When the  key is 
pressed, the answer is given in simpliﬁ ed form.
•  The display on the Casio FX-55 is similar to that 
on the TI-15 except that the ﬁ rst fraction does not 
remain on the display when the operation sign 
appears with the second common fraction. To 
divide 3
4 by 1
4 with this calculator, enter 3
4, , and 
1
4. The 3
4 appears ﬁ rst; then the  sign and 1
4 appear 
simultaneously. When  is pressed, the quotient 
3 is displayed.

•  The Sharp EL-500L displays the entire algorithm 
as an operation is performed. When you multiply 
1
2 and 2
8, you see “1
2  2
8” build on the display as 
entries are made. When  is pressed, the screen 
shows the product in simplest form without the 
algorithm.
Whatever calculator students use, they should have 
opportunities to learn to perform operations with 
common fractions using that calculator. Activity

with common and decimal fractions.

lars to determine the prices of grocery items. Stu-
dents compute the cost of a typical weekly grocery 
list using the circular.
Westlands School
150 Dalton Rd.
Chelmsford, MA
Dear Parent,
Your daughter/son will be using a weekly grocery store circular to complete 
this project. They will try to compile a weekly grocery list with a total cost that 
comes as close as possible to, but not exceeding, $75.00. Please help your 
child to develop a reasonable shopping list for items that are contained in the 
circular.
If I can answer any questions, I can be contacted at school.
 1.  Have your child select one grocery store circular to use for the project.
 2.  Go through the circular, pointing out all items that you would usually 
purchase for the week, along with other items you might purchase less 
frequently.
 3.  Check your child’s ﬁ nal list and cost to be sure that the list contains items 
you usually purchase.

Summary
Activities that give children an understanding of com-
mon and decimal fractions are an essential part of the el-
ementary school curriculum. The work done in primary 
grades serves as a foundation for more abstract concepts 
in higher grades. The intent in elementary school is to 
provide children with basic ideas about common and 
decimal fractions.
Common fractions have several meanings, depend-
ing on the context in which they are used. Children learn 
that common fractions are used to express parts of a unit 
or set of objects that has been partitioned into equal-size 
parts or groups, to express ratios, and to indicate division. 
Decimal fractions are used to represent parts of whole 
objects or collections of objects but have denominators 
that are 10 or a power of 10. The denominator is not writ-
ten but is indicated by the number of numerals there are 
to the right of the ones place in a decimal numeral. Stu-
dents need experiences with concrete and semiconcrete 
models that represent both common and decimal frac-
tions and their uses. Geometric regions, fraction strips, 
markers, number lines, and various manipulatives are 
used during initial activities. These same materials help 
students to learn about equivalent fractions and to com-
pare common fractions. Materials such as Cuisenaire 
sets, kits made from construction paper, fraction strips, 
and number lines are aids that students can use to learn 
the meaning of decimal fractions.
Operations with fractional numbers expressed as 
common and decimal fractions require the same careful 
development as operations with whole numbers. Even 
though children are older when operations with frac-
tional numbers are developed, the processes are devel-
oped through carefully sequenced activities with appro-
priate learning aids rather than by rules alone.
Real-world problems illustrate situations that give rise 
to addition and subtraction with common and decimal 
fractions. Geometric regions, fraction strips, number 
lines, and decimal fraction models should accompany 
real-world problems to give meaning to the operations. 
References to similarities between operations with whole 
numbers and those with fractional numbers should be 
stressed whenever appropriate. Addition and subtraction 
with mixed numerals are a challenge to many children. 
Children need to learn the meaning of multiplication and 
division with common fractions through activities that 
develop the processes intuitively. They do this by deal-
ing with real-world situations that involve multiplication 
and division.
Activities involving estimation when multiplying and 
dividing with decimal fractions help children learn to 
place decimal points properly in products and quotients. 
As children mature, they learn how to name common 
fractions in their simplest forms. At the same time they 
learn that the need to simplify fractions is determined 
by the situation in which they are used. Each of the four 
operations can be done with both common and decimal 
fractions on a calculator that has the capability of han-
dling common fractions, such as the Texas Instruments 
TI-15, the Casio FX-55, or the Sharp EL-500L.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  A number of the operations discussed in this chap-
ter, especially multiplication and division with com-
mon fractions, are not well understood by students. 
Consider your own understanding of this chapter’s 
operations. Which do you believe you understand 
well? Which ones do you not understand well? 
Think not only about your ability to perform each 
operation but also your understanding of situations 
that give rise to each one. Are there any operations 
that you understand better now than you did before 
you read the chapter? To what do you attribute 
your good or poor understanding of any of the 
operations?
 2.  Word problems are used frequently in this chapter 
to present situations leading to multiplication and di-
vision with common and decimal fractions. Develop 
your own skill in creating word problems for real-life 
situations by writing a problem for each of the fol-
lowing sentences. Also sketch the objects or use real 
objects to model each sentence. Which sentences 
can be interpreted as repeated addition? Which of 
the division sentences represent partitive situations? 
measurement situations?

 3.  Estimation is recommended as a way to help stu-
dents learn how to place a decimal point in a prod-
uct or quotient when they compute with decimal 
fractions. Explain the thought process that a child 
might use to estimate a product or quotient for each 
of these examples:
  a.  4.8  2.3  1104
  b.  36.2  1.08  39096
  c.  48.36  51  246636
  d.  21.8240  3.2  682
  e.  9.966  33  302
 4.  Explained in this chapter are ways that calculators 
can simplify common fractions, rename improper 
fractions as mixed numerals, and perform opera-
tions with fractional numbers. Practice each process 
 
 
329

and operation with a suitable calculator until you 
can do them easily. Write a statement in which you 
explain your position on student use of a calcula-
tor for work with common fractions. How do you 
envision calculators changing the way common 
fractions are taught and learned in the elemen-
tary school of the future? If you believe they will 
not—or should not—lead to any changes, state your 
reasons.
 5.  Research the standardized tests administered in 
your state. Do any of the tests allow for calculators? 
What effect does this have on teaching common and 
decimal actions?

Using Children’s Literature
Watson, Clyde. (1972). Tom Fox and the apple pie. New 
York: Thomas Y. Cromwell. (Grades 4– 6) 
In Tom Fox and the Apple Pie, Tom Fox buys an apple 
pie at the county fair and carries it home. On the way 
home he envisions sharing the pie with the rest of his 
family—all 15 of them! Because cutting a pie into 16 
pieces would make very small pieces, Tom schemes to 
wait until his brothers and sisters are out of the house 
before cutting up the pie; that way, there would be only 
eight pieces, and each piece would be larger. But not 
large enough for Tom. He then plans to serve this pie to 
only four people, then two, and ﬁ nally concludes the 
pie is just right for only him.
 
Here are some assessment activities and questions 
for this book:
•  Write a fraction to describe one piece of pie as Tom 
imagines 16 pieces, 8 pieces, 4 pieces, and 2 pieces.
•  Compare these fractions, and tell how the denomina-
tor changes. How many pieces would a pie have if one 
piece were  1
25 of the pie?
•  As the denominator increases in these fractions, what 
happens to the size of one piece of pie?
•  Have students cut paper dinner plates into the same 
number of pieces that Tom imagines for his pie: 2, 4, 
8, and 16. Have them write the fraction that describes 
one piece of each pie, and then compare the pieces. 
(How many sixteenths are in one-eighth? in one-
fourth? in one-half? How many fourths are in one-half? 
and so forth.)
•  Have students reassemble a single pie by using 
different-size pieces to make their composite pie. Have 
student volunteers show their different composite pies 
and describe who in the story would be able to share 
the pie.

Children’s work with multiplication involving

edge, which was determined by having them react to 
equal-sharing situations. Real-world situations were 
presented, and children used drawings and verbal 
descriptions to explain the meaning of multiplication 
with common fractions. The practice laid a foundation 
for later work with mathematical sentences.

Moss makes a compelling case for introducing 
percents even before fractions as a means of dividing 
up a number line into smaller segments. Once students

Developing 
Aspects of 
Proportional 
Reasoning: 
Ratio, Proportion, 
and Percent
roportional reasoning involves understanding how quan-
tities vary in relation to each other. It is the relationship 
between two quantities that may vary but remain in the 
same relationship or ratio. Proportional reasoning is an 
overarching principle of all mathematics and is central to all 
subdisciplines of mathematics. For example, proportional reasoning is used 
in geometry with similar ﬁ gures and dilations (see Chapter 17); in algebra with 
slopes of lines, work problems, and rate problems; 
in probability to determine chances of events hap-
pening; and in calculus with related rates problems. 
Anyone who computes miles per gallon, changes a 
recipe for a larger number of servings, or purchases 
fruit at a grocery store uses proportional reasoning.
In middle school, students reason proportion-
ally when they compute percentages, and when, 
with decimal and common fractions, they work 
with rates, determine probabilities, and explore 
similar ﬁ gures. Outside school, children reason

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Proportional Reasoning
Despite the emphasis on proportional reasoning in 
school mathematics, middle school and high school 
students have difﬁ culty with situations that require 
them to reason about proportional relationships. 
Data from the Third International Mathematics and 
Science Study (TIMSS) show that proportionality is 
the most difﬁ cult problem area for students in the 
middle grades (Beaton et al., 1996). Even preservice 
teachers can have difﬁ culty reasoning proportion-
ally (Cramer et al., 1989). Thus it is critical to intro-
duce appropriate real-world settings that will lay 
the foundation for proportional reasoning in the 
elementary and middle grades.
What Teachers Should Know 
About Teaching Proportional 
Reasoning
Proportional reasoning can be a difﬁ cult concept for 
children, even in the middle grades. Teachers should 
give careful attention to the development of propor-
tional reasoning in students. The tendency is for stu-
dents to solve problems using an additive approach. 
Teachers should counteract this by building students’ 
understanding of multiplicative relationships.
Solving proportion problems should be ap-
proached from the vantage point of multiplicative 
relationships. Algorithms, such as the cross-product 
algorithm, should not be introduced until students 
have fully developed and reﬁ ned their understand-
ing that proportional relationships involve multipli-
cative relationships.
Students’ understanding of all the facets of per-
cent is closely linked to their understanding of pro-
portional relationships. Students should use pro-
portional relationships to solve percent problems, 
rather than rely on an algorithm applied by rote or a 
memorized rule to solve a problem.
Few NCTM standards explicitly cite proportional 
reasoning (see later discussion). However, for ear-
lier grade levels the standards for number and op-
eration that involve fractions, decimals, and even 
multiplication relationships could be considered 
part of proportionality. We have not included those 
standards here, only those that speciﬁ cally mention 
ratio, proportion, or percent.
NCTM Standards and 
Expectations
Grades 6– 8 Expectations:
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  work ﬂ exibly with fractions, decimals, and percents to 
solve problems;
•  compare and order fractions, decimals, and percents ef-
ﬁ ciently, and ﬁ nd their approximate locations on a num-
ber line;

proportionally when they make purchases based on rates, reading maps,
or doubling a recipe. NCTM identiﬁ es proportionality as a key mathemati-
cal concept for all grades and proportional reasoning as a major method of
thinking in mathematics, deeming the study of proportional reasoning “of 
such great importance that it merits whatever time and effort must be ex-
pended to assure its careful development” (National Council of Teachers 
of Mathematics, 1989, P. 82).

•  develop meaning for percents greater than 100 and less 
than 1;
•  understand and use ratios and proportions to represent 
quantitative relationships.
Ratios as a Foundation 
of Proportional Reasoning
To begin to work with proportions and proportional 
reasoning, students must have a foundational un-
derstanding of ratios. (A proportion is an equality 
between two or more ratios, such as 2
3  4
6  6
9.) A 
ratio can be expressed in several forms: as a frac-
tion (2
3), in colon notation (2 : 3), or in common En-
glish expressions (two to three or two out of three). 
The two different symbolic notations are not trou-
bling to students, who can easily move between 2
3 
and 2 : 3. However, there is much more to ratio and 
proportional reasoning than notation. As suggested 
in Chapter 12, a ratio can be considered a fraction 
in the part-whole sense that fractions represent. 
However, a ratio can represent other mathematical 
relationships.
The most famous number in mathematics, p, is a ratio 
between the circumference C and the diameter d of a 
circle (C/d).
Meanings of Ratio
Part-Whole Sense
In this representation the ratio describes a subset 
and the entire set, for example, the ratio of the num-
ber of red marbles (6) 
compared to all the 
marbles (10) in the bag 
is 6 : 10 or 
6
10 (Figure 
15.1a).
Part-Part Sense
The ratio in this setting 
describes the relation-
ship between two sub-
sets of the same set, for example the ratio of the 
number of blue yo-yos to the number of green yo-
yos is 4
7 (Figure 15.1b).

Relationship Between Two Independent Sets
In this case the two sets may be unrelated, such as 
the number of milk cartons (4) and the number of 
cookies (9). This ratio of cartons to cookies is 4 : 9. 
This relationship can also be described as the num-
ber of cookies to cartons, 9 : 4. The two sets can also 
be units of measurement, such as the ratio of the 
length of a yardstick to the length of a 12-inch ruler, 
36 : 12 (Figure 15.1c).

such as 55 miles per hour (55 : 1) (Figure 15.1d).

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Probability Relationships
The chance of rolling an even number 
with a single number cube is 3 : 6 (Fig -
ure 15.1e).
Ratio as an Operator
In this case the ratio is not an expression to describe 
a relationship between two sets but a rate or number 
that acts on another number. For example, a stuffed 
toy bear is designed to look like the real thing 
but is smaller in size. Such a toy is perhaps 1
12 the 
height of a real bear. The scale factor is 1 : 12, and 
if a real bear is 6 feet tall, then the stuffed toy bear is 
6  1
12  1
2 foot or 6 inches tall (Figure 15.1f).
(f)
The connection between common fractions and 
reasoning proportionally is not simple. When com-
mon fraction representations are used to indicate 
ratios, they should be interpreted differently from 
when they represent part-whole relationships. Com-
mon fractions do not require labels for each of their 
numerical parts because they are both drawn from 
the same set. For example, the number of green mar-
bles (9) in a bag of 22 marbles is represented as 9
22. 
In a ratio, each numerical term should be labeled to 
convey the correct representation that the ratio por-
trays. The fraction 9
22 can be considered a ratio. The 
ratio 9
22 might convey the relationship of the number 
of automobiles to the number of cell phones among 
a group of high school seniors. In this case the nu-
merator of the ratio expression tells the number of 
objects in one set (number of automobiles) and the 
denominator tells the number of objects in an en-
tirely different set (cell phones). Furthermore, a ratio 
may have 0 in the denominator—for example, the 
ratio of days in a week compared to the number of 
pigs with wings (7
0).
Another difference between ratios and fractions 
can be exhibited by considering a classroom with 
12 boys and 14 girls. The ratio describing the rela-
tionship between the number of girls and boys can 
be represented as either 12
14 (boys to girls) or 14
12 (girls 
to boys). The fraction 12
14, which describes 12 marbles 
out of 14 marbles can never be represented as 14
12. 
Suppose that two boys and three girls join the class. 
The ratio of the newcomers is 2
3. The new ratio of 
boys to girls is 14
17, found by adding the two numera-
tors and two denominators [(12  2)/(14  3)]. Com-
mon fractions cannot be added in this manner.
Ratios are not independent numerical expres-
sions. They must be understood in the context of 
the relationships they represent. Consequently, care 
must be used when fraction notation is introduced 
as a way of indicating ratios to be sure that children 
understand the difference between common frac-
tions and ratios from the very start.
Teaching Proportional Reasoning
Fluency and full applications with ratio and propor-
tional reasoning are a focus of the middle school 
curriculum. However, younger children can engage 
in a number of activities 
and explorations that will 
help them begin to de-
velop their proportional 
reasoning skills.
The common difﬁ culty 
that children (and many 
adults) have with propor-
tional reasoning is that 
they do not understand 
that proportions represent 
multiplication or multipli-
cative reasoning. Instead, 
they believe that many 
proportional 
situations 
show addition or additive 
relationships. 
Consider 
the following problem:
•  For every four laps around the track that Janelle 
ran, Keith ran three laps. Janelle ran eight laps. 
How many laps did Keith run?
(e)
MISCONCEPTION
Because ratios can be rep-
resented in the familiar 
common fraction form, 
some children believe 
that they can be used in 
fraction computations. 
Given a common fraction, 
there are many equivalent 
fractions, 2
5  4
10  6
15  8
20. 
However this is not true 
with ratios. Consider a 
setting in which there are 
two children who must 
share ﬁ ve cookies. This 
ratio of 2
5 is not equivalent 
to a ratio of 4
10 because 
there are neither 4 chil-
dren nor 10 cookies.

 
Chapter 15 Developing Aspects of Proportional Reasoning: Ratio, Proportion, and Percent 
337
Janelle ran 4 more laps, Keith will run 4 more laps, 
or 7 (3  4) laps. Children require many activities 
before they can comfortably reason about propor-
tions using multiplicative reasoning. It might be said 
that students who cannot reason multiplicatively 
are thinking at a concrete level. In order to reason 
multiplicatively (proportionally), they must reason 
at a more abstract, or operational level. Moreover, 
additive approaches to such a problem can be lik-
ened to a default strategy. That is, students who are 
unsure of how to proceed tend to fall back on addi-
tive procedures.
Activity 15.1 presents children with a qualitative 
problem—that is, one without direct computation. 
Such qualitative problems eliminate the need for in-
volved computations and a speciﬁ c numerical solu-
tion. Instead, in this activity students compare lem-
onade recipes and decide if new recipes will taste 
sweeter, sourer, or the same as the original, but they 
do not quantify their answers by determining how 
ACTIVITY 15.1

Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students solve qualitative problems that develop pro-
portional thinking.

•  Ask children how to make lemonade. Probe for a recipe 
that includes lemon juice, sugar, and water. Discuss how 
the lemon juice and the sugar each affect the taste of the 
lemonade.
•  Put a recipe for lemonade on the board: 1 cup juice, 1 cup 
sugar, 3 cups water.
•  Mimic making this recipe by adding a pretend cup of 
sugar from one container and a pretend cup of lemon 
juice from another container into the pretend water con-
tainer and mixing thoroughly.
•  Now ask what happens if you make lemonade with a new 
recipe. Ask children for volunteers to act out adding 1 cup 
of juice and 2 cups of sugar to the water. Ask students to 
compare the new lemonade to the original recipe. Is the 
new ﬂ avor the same, sweeter, or sourer? As students talk 
in their groups, be sure they have an explanation for their 
decision.
•  Discuss various groups’ reasons as a class. Students may 
correctly reason that because there is now more sugar 
than lemon juice, then the recipe will make a sweeter 
lemonade.
•  Repeat with a different recipe: 2 cups of juice and 1 cup 
of sugar with 2 cups of water.
•  Have children consider the ﬂ avors offered by these recipes 
as their groups compare each one to the original recipe:
•  As children talk about the ﬂ avors, move about the groups 
to listen to their discussions. Look for opportunities to 
ask groups to explain their reasoning when they have 
correct answers. Probe for multiplicative reasoning in the 
discussions by asking why one of the recipes (3 cups sugar 
and 3 cups juice) tastes the same as the original recipe. 
Ask for new recipes that would taste the same as the 
original.
•  Similar qualitative problems can involve a fruit salad 
recipe, chocolate ﬂ avoring and milk, and ingredients for 
fruit punch.

In this proportional setting, solving the problem 
correctly requires multiplicative reasoning. The ra-
tio of laps Janelle ran to the number of laps Keith ran 
is 4 : 3 or 4
3. The correct answer is that since Janelle 
doubled the number of laps she ran (2  4), Keith 
would double the number of laps he ran. The answer 
is that Keith ran 6 (3  2) laps. The ratio of the ﬁ nal 
number of laps is 8
6, which is equivalent to the origi-
nal ratio of 4
3. Children who are reasoning from an 
additive perspective will instead reason that since

lowing, which shows the same rate between the two 
objects, is called a rate table:
Red 
Green 
Children’s experiences with money and the cost 
of objects provide another setting because there is 
a ratio between the object and the money. If one 
package of candy costs 27 cents, there is a ratio of 
1 package for every 27 cents. This ratio can be ex-
pressed as 1 to 27, 1 : 27, or 
1
27. There is a ratio be-
tween time and distance traveled. A driver whose 
speed averages 55 miles per hour has the ratio 55 
miles traveled for every 1 hour. The ratio of miles 
to hours can be expressed as 55 to 1, 55 : 1, or 
55
1 . 
Ratios such as these are rate pairs. A rate is usually a 
ratio representing two different sets or measures so 
that one of the terms of the ratio is 1, such as miles 
per hour (1 hour), heartbeats per minute (1 minute), 
or $6.75 per pound (1 pound). Activity 15.2 shows 
much sweeter or sourer. Thus students can focus on 
the multiplicative aspects of the problem without 
the concern for manipulation of the numbers.
Developing Proportional 
Reasoning Using Rate Pairs 
and Tables
By the time the concepts of ratio and proportion are 
introduced in upper elementary and middle school, 
children have had many experiences that provide 
familiar situations through which to introduce ratios 
and their notation. When children assemble a bag 
of marbles with two red and four green marbles, 
they express the ratio between the two colors as 2 : 4 
or 1 : 2. They then add more marbles of each color 
to the bag, making sure that the resulting ratio of 
red to green marbles is still 1 : 2. To do so, they might 
build a table of marble colors that shows the ratio of 
1 : 2 for each pair of entries. A table such as the fol-

using rate pairs.
Materials: Real or representative miniboxes of raisins, sports 
trading cards, apples, and similar items that children might buy; 
representative coins—pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters; direction 
card denoting cost of various items; copies of blank ratio tables; 
and a different colored pencil for each student. Package the items 
in separate bags—a dozen of one item and $3.00 worth of coins 
in each bag. Make one set for each team of four children.

•  Tell the children that they are to use the Round Robin 
cooperative-learning format. Each team will have a bag 
containing several items and some coins. Their task is to 
complete the table by indicating the cost of various group-
ings of items. For example, a direction card says, “There 
are three trading cards in each package. Three cards cost 
49 cents.” (Use a different ratio on each direction card.) 
The team is to ﬁ ll in the rate table to show the cost of 6, 
9, 12, . . . cards.
Number of items 
Cost 
•  One member of the team lays out one pack of cards and 
49 cents in coins, and a second ﬁ lls in the ﬁ rst cells in the 
table. The third child lays out another pack and another 
49 cents, and the fourth ﬁ lls in the next column of cells. 
Action rotates as each new set of materials and coins is 
laid out and cells are ﬁ lled. Each child uses a different 
colored pencil to ﬁ ll in cells.
•  Each team completes the same routine with its set of 
materials.
•  When all teams are ﬁ nished, each one explains its work to 
classmates. Discussion should emphasize the concepts of 
ratios, proportions, and rate tables. In this situation, ratio 
refers to the number of items and their cost. The ratio for 
three cards and their cost is 3 to 49 cents, expressed as 
3:49 or 3
49; the ratio for six cards is 6:98 or 6
98.
Extension
•  Have students gather average gas mileage ﬁ gures for 
sport utility vehicles, and make rate tables showing gaso-
line consumed and distance traveled. Information is avail-
able in brochures from auto dealers and, for some makes 
of automobiles, on the Internet. For example, connect 
with the General Motors Company website for informa-
tion about GM vehicles.

how a shopping situation can be used to introduce 
the concept of rate pairs and to help children un-
derstand and record ratios. See Activity 15.3 for an 
activity that has students identify and interpret rate 
pairs from a rate table.
Many rates are familiar to adults but not to chil-
dren. For instance, when a car travels 300 miles us-
ing 25 gallons of gas, we think in terms of miles per 
gallon: 300
25   12 miles per gallon. Although miles per 
gallon is the conventional expression, these data 
could just as well be used to determine gallons per 
mile: 25
300  0.08 gallon per mile. To children who are 
inexperienced with real-life applications, either rate 
is perfectly reasonable. As you design problems for 
children to explore, help them to become familiar 
with the generally accepted rates commonly used in 
real-life applications. Activity 15.4 presents common 
situations for students to represent in two different 
ratios, as before, and then asks students to select the 
ratio that they think represents the common ratio for 
each problem.

Name three additional examples of rate-pair situa-
tions. Money was involved in Activity 15.2. Include 
money in only one of your situations. Give three 
other examples of proportion situations. •••
When children ﬁ rst begin to work with ratios and 
rate pairs (Activities 15.2 and 15.3), they may not use 
E
any multiplicative understandings. In the following 
rate table, for example, some children will complete 
the second row by simply adding $0.39 to the previ-
ous total.

They can complete the table correctly, but they 
do not understand the multiplicative underpinnings 
of ratios, rates, and proportions. Children require 
many activities that help them make the leap in rate 
situations from applying addition to applying multi-
plication instead. Problems involving rate pairs can 
be a good place to introduce algebraic concepts, in-
cluding using a variable to reference a missing value 
(see Chapter 16).
Working with Proportions
Using Equivalent Fractions
Proportion is the equality between two or more ra-
tios. There is a proportional relationship between 
1 : 39 and 2 : 78 and any other rate pair in the rate 
table given in the previous section ( 1
39  2
78  3
117, 
. . .). As shown in this section, proportions are a key 
part of solving problems that involve proportional 
reasoning.
ACTIVITY 15.3
 
Ratios at Work
Level: Grades 4–6
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students develop a strategy for using ratios and propor-
tions to solve problems.
Materials: Overhead transparency with blank rate-pair table, 
marking pen, projector, problem cards, printed copies of blank 
rate-pair tables
•  Begin with this story: “Carla and Carmen share responsi-
bility for managing a gift shop. Carla is at the shop four 
days a week, and Carmen is there three days. When Carla 
has been at the shop for 20 days, how many days has 
Carmen been there?”
•  Project the blank rate-pair table. Discuss the ratio formed 
by comparing the two work schedules. Write different 
representations beneath the table: 4 to 3, 4
3, 4:3.
•  Have children give the ﬁ rst entry, and write it in. Fill in the 
table until 20 and 15 are entered.
•  Discuss the meanings of the entries. Point out that the 
rate table shows that when Carla has worked 20 days, 
Carmen has worked 15 days. Write the ratio: 20
15 or 20:15.
•  Ask: “What numbers from the table are given in the prob-
lem?” (Answer: 4, 3, and 20). “How can I express those 
numbers as a proportion?” (Answer: 4

n ). Help children 
see the connection between this situation and equiva-
lent common fractions. “If we rename 4
3 as an equivalent 
fraction with a numerator of 20, by what number is 4 
multiplied?” (Answer: 5). “How will we determine the 
denominator for the new fraction?” (Answer: multiply 3 
by 5). “What is the denominator?” (Answer: 15). Verify 
the answer with the table.

ACTIVITY 15.4
 
Finding the Right Rate (Communication)
Level: Grades 5 and 6
Setting: Groups of three students
Objective: Students explore the meanings of common rates.
Materials: Paper and pencils
•  Post the rate 55 mph on the board. Ask students if they 
know what mph stands for. Then ask students in their 
groups to explain what 55 mph means to someone who 
is driving a car. Probe that the traveled distance is 55 miles 
in 1 hour.
•  Now post 0.018 hpm (hours per mile) on the board. 
Describe this as “eighteen-thousandths of an hour per 
mile.” Ask students in their groups to explain if this rate 
could describe the speed of a car. Probe that although the 
decimal fraction is quite small, the speed of a car could be 
described by what part of an hour was needed to travel 
1 mile, in this case 0.018 hour or about 1 minute. Such a 
rate is difﬁ cult to understand, especially with a rate less 
than 1. Most students will readily dismiss this rate as a 
way of representing speed.
•  Ask students to explain why 55 mph is easier to under-
stand than 0.018 hpm.
•  Suggest that there are other rates that are common but 
that may be written in this inverse style. Ask students to 
represent two different rates for the following common 
situations, and then select the rate they think is most 
meaningful. (Note: Many times students have not had the 
out-of-school experiences that adult consumers have, so it 
can be quite challenging for them to select the better rate 
representation. In some cases, such as 4 or 6, either rate is 
acceptable.)
1. Six apples cost $2.00.
2. A human heart beats 540 times in 8 minutes.
3. Dean rode his bike 18 miles in 3 hours.
4. Five dollars ($5.00) is worth £3 (British pounds).
5. There are 30 CDs in 6 cases.
6. The willow tree grew 18 feet in 3 years.
7. Jose earned $54 in 9 hours.
Teachers help children connect the concepts of 
ratios and proportions to the concept of equivalent 
fractions as another means of solving proportions. 
For example, a dessert recipe for three people calls 
for 2 cups of ﬂ our. At this same rate, how many cups 
of ﬂ our does the same recipe require for 12 people? 
The proportion for this problem consists of the two 
ratios speciﬁ ed in the problem. The two ratios are 
equal, because the ratio of cups of ﬂ our to the num-
ber of people must remain the same for any number 
of people for the recipe to be correct. The propor-
tion may be represented as
3
2  12
?
Students can use equivalent fractions to solve for the 
missing term, 8 cups of ﬂ our. (Note that applying the 
cross-product algorithm could solve the problem. 
We discuss the algorithm later in this chapter and 
suggest delaying its use in elementary school.)
Any problem solved using a rate table can be 
solved using a proportion. Solving a problem using 
proportions is more efﬁ cient than using a rate table. 
To avoid rote use of proportions by students, teach -
ers should be sure that students are conﬁ dent 
using rate tables before setting up and solving 
proportions.
Proportional relationships involving ratios are 
frequently used in problem solving. Consider the 
situation in Activity 15.1. This activity will give most 
children a good foundation for understanding ratios 
and proportions. Because proportional thinking is 
developmental, according to Piaget, students grow 
in their ability to reason competently about propor-
tional relationships through middle school and even 
high school. Nevertheless younger children beneﬁ t 
from introductory activities such as Activities 15.1 
and 15.2.
Solving Proportions 
Using a Multiples Table
Once students are comfortable using rate tables to 
solve proportion problems (see Activities 15.2– 15.4), 
they are then ready to use a multiples table. Students 
can use a multiples table (Table 15.1) to solve many 
different proportion problems.
Consider the following problem.
•  Two pounds of chocolates costs $5.00. How much 
will 12 pounds of chocolates cost?

In Table 15.1 the known values of the problem are 
circled: 2, 5, and 12. Notice that because 2 and 5 
both refer to the same data fact, they are located 
in the same row. They could be represented as the 
ratio 2
5, for pounds of chocolate to cost in dollars. 
The other known value is 12, which refers to a differ-
ent number of pounds of chocolate. What number 
in the rate table would form an equivalent ratio with 
12? That number must appear in the same column 
as 5 in order to produce an equivalent ratio. Each of 
the pairs of numbers in the 2 column and the 5 col-
umn produce equivalent ratios. The answer to the 
problem is the number in the square, 30. A multiples 
table such as the one in Table 15.1 can be used to 
solve a variety of proportion problems.
The problem might also be solved using only part 
of the multiples table, much like using a rate table.

$30. Children might be given the option to solve 
these proportion problems by using what they have 
learned about equivalent fractions (see Chapters 13 
and 14). Students who opt to use equivalent frac-
tions instead of a rate table might be asked to ex-
plain their reasoning to the class.
What solution strategies can children use in ad-
dition to equivalent strategies?
Two other methods 
that students can use to 
solve proportion problems 
are unitizing and using the 
unit rate. Unitizing can be 
used to solve a problem 
such as “Apples cost $1.50 
for 2 pounds. How much 
will 9 pounds cost?” In 
this case, the amount of 
apples, 2 pounds, is taken 
as a unit or chunk. How 
many of these chunks are 
needed to be equivalent to 9 pounds? Four chunks is 
8 pounds (4  2), and 5 chunks is 10 pounds (5  2). 
So 41
2 chunks will make the 9 pounds. The 41
2 chunks 
will also apply to the cost. If 1 chunk of cost is $1.50, 
then 41
2 chunks will be the total cost of the apples. 
Four chunks is $6.00 (4  $1.50), and half a chunk 
is $0.75 ( 1
2  $1.50). So the total cost is $6.75 ($6.00 
 $0.75). A rate table could help children solve this 
type of problem even though it does not represent 
whole number relationships.
Unitizing 
can 
be 
used with many prob-
lems, but in some cases 
the numbers in the prob-
lem do not lend them-
selves to unitizing, such 
as when pears cost $1.59 
for 5 pounds and a per-
son wishes to purchase 
9 pounds. In that case, 
a method that students 
might use is unit rates. 
This 
problem-solving 
strategy involves ﬁ nd-
ing the unit rate, in this case, the price of one pound 
of apples (1 pound is the unit). Grocery stores fre-
quently post the unit rate or unit price of their prod-
ucts. Unit rates can be used to solve the following 
problem: “Apples cost $1.98 for 3 pounds. How much 
do 10 pounds cost?” In this case, the price for a sin-
gle pound of apples (the unit) is $1.98  3  $0.66. 
The cost for 10 pounds is 10  $0.66, or $6.60.
Unit rates can be combined with estimation to 
comparison shop. For example, consider the follow-
ing situation:
•  A 12-ounce bottle of herbal vinegar costs $4.49, 
and a 10-ounce bottle costs $3.95. Which is the 
better buy?
In this case, unit rates 
combined with estima-
tion can determine the 
better buy. The cost per 
ounce for the 10-ounce 
bottle is approximately 
$0.40 ($3.95  10). At 
that rate, the 12-ounce 
bottle would cost ap-
proximately 
$4.80, 
which is more than 
$4.49 (12  $0.40  $4.80), so the 12-ounce bottle of 
vinegar is the better buy.
Proportional 
reason-
ing is required in many ge-
ometry settings. Consider 
the two similar rectangles 
shown here.
The 
rectangles 
are 
similar, so their sides are 
in proportion. The side 
lengths of the larger rect-
angle are three times the 
side lengths of the smaller rectangle (2  3  6). 
Thus the length of the missing side is 15 (5  3). 
Some students will incorrectly reason that because

the corresponding side of the larger rectangle is 4 
units longer than the matching side in the smaller 
rectangle, then the missing side is also 4 units longer 
and so must have a length of 9 (5  4).
When children have had many opportunities to 
use both methods, they are able to use unitizing in 
those problems where it is most appropriate, allow-
ing them to ﬁ nd the answer quickly. They are also 
able to use unit rates for problems that do not lend 
themselves to unitizing. Activity 15.6 uses the Inter-
net as a means to allow students to change distance 
and rates to determine the race winner. Students 
can plan their solutions using both unitizing and 
unit rates.

Solving for Proportion Using 
the Cross-Product Algorithm
What about using the cross-product 
algorithm to solve proportion prob-
lems? There is no question that the 
E
cross-product algorithm (as illustrated) is effective 
and efﬁ cient. It can be used to solve any propor-
tion problem, whether it includes all whole number 
values or not.
Consider the follow-
ing proportion, formed 
from two pairs of sides 
of similar rectangles in 
Figure 15.2. This problem 
is difﬁ cult to solve using 
rate tables or unitizing. 
It could be solved using 
unit rates, but the com-
putations would be chal-
lenging and tedious to 
some students. The cross-
product algorithm can 
be used here to quickly 
solve the problem.

•  Demonstrate how to change starting positions and length 
of strides for each character.
•  Ask students to decide who will win the race using various

the applet to show the results.
•  Allow students the opportunity to experiment with 
changing starting positions and stride lengths.
•  After students have had sufﬁ cient time to experiment 
with the applet, have them produce starting positions and 
stride lengths to match the following stories:
1.  The boy and girl start from the same place. The boy 
gets to the tree ahead of the girl.
2.  The girl starts behind the boy. The girl gets to the tree 
before the boy.
3.  The boy starts at the tree and the girl starts at the 
house. The girl gets to the tree before the boy gets to 
the house.
4.  The girl starts halfway to the house and the boy starts 
at the tree. They both get to the house at the same 
time.
5.  The boy has a stride that is four times as long as the 
girl’s stride. If the boy starts at the tree, where must 
the girl start to get to the house at the same time 
as the boy? Be sure to have students explain their 
answers to this one.
MISCONCEPTION
Students who have a 
shallow understanding of 
proportional relationships 
will frequently confuse the 
cross-product algorithm 
with the algorithm for mul-
tiplying fractions. They 
fail to discern the differ-
ence between these two 
mathematical operations 
(see later discussion) and 
will apply the incorrect 
algorithm, using the cross-
product algorithm, for 
example, when multiply-
ing common fractions.

of proportions. In addition, without the founda-
tional understandings developed by the processes 
described earlier, students will apply the algorithm 
without any thought to the proportional relation-
ships involved. Teachers should delay teaching stu-
dents the cross-product algorithm until the students 
have experienced many proportional situations us-
ing a variety of strategies.
Developing and Extending 
Concepts of Percent
A complete understanding of percent requires the 
same multiplicative reasoning used with propor-
tions. The pervasive nature of percent makes it im-
portant that students acquire a good understanding 
of its meaning and uses. In practice, percent is used 
in a variety of ways, and its applications are numer-
ous in business, government, science, and industry, 
as well as in many aspects of daily life. In one day, 
one of us encountered these uses:
•  The Federal Reserve Board lowered the short-
term interest rate by 0.25%.
•  You can get 2.9% interest on a new car loan 
through the month of October.

Research for the Classroom
•
Several research studies indicate that children must 
develop a variety of approaches to solve problems that 
require proportional reasoning. One such study focused on 
what seem to be straightforward missing-term proportion 
problems such as the following: Five shirts require 10 yards 
of cloth. How many yards of cloth will 15 shirts require?
 
This problem can be solved using a proportion linking 
shirts and cloth or by using proportions linking shirts to 
shirts and cloth to cloth. Both of these proportions are 
shown here.

yards of cloth

?

15  10
?
It may appear that the proportions are essentially the 
same. Mathematically they are equivalent, and both will 
result in the correct solution to the problem. However, 
they are conceptually different. The ﬁ rst proportion relates 
values within the understood comparison between shirts 
and cloth. The second proportion relates values across the 
given comparison of shirts and cloth, relating independent 
quantities of shirts to each other and independent quanti-
ties of cloth to each other. The research ﬁ ndings were that 
children who had ample opportunities to use both forms 
of the proportion used the form that best ﬁ t a problem 
in their view. In other words, the children did not use the 
same form of the proportion for all problems but used the 
form that appealed to their personal conceptualization of 
the problem.
 
The implication for classroom teachers is that the 
teachers’ way of viewing a proportion problem may not 
be the way their students view it. Rather than following a 
preconceived relationship that does not reﬂ ect students’ 
understanding of the problem, teachers need to provide 
the tools to construct proportional relationships that 
make sense to their students in the context of a particu-
lar problem (Lamon, 1999, 1994; Vergnaud, 1983). Thus 
teachers should provide experiences where students form 
proportions that represent both within and between 
relationships.

•  The registrar of voters predicts a turnout of 32% 
of registered voters for the November general 
election.
•  Sacramento County’s sales tax was raised to 7.75% 
with approval of an additional 0.50% for transpor-
tation improvements.
•  A computer sales company advertised pro-
motional prices of up to 70% off on selected 
merchandise.
Meaning of Percent
Percent expresses a relationship between a number 
and 100. The symbol % indicates a denominator of 
100; the word percent names the symbol and means 
“per hundred” or “out of 100.” For example, 15% is an 
expression of the ratio between the numbers 15 and 
100; it means 15 parts per 100 or 15 out of 100.
State and local governments use a sales tax as a 
means of raising revenue. A tax of 6 percent means 
that for every 100 cents ($1.00) of the purchase price 
of an article, a tax of 6 cents (0.06 of $1.00) will be 
collected by the merchant and remitted to the state. 
This setting provides a basis for discussing terms 
used in connection with percent. When an item is 
sold for $10, the cost is the base to which the tax 
is applied, 6% is the rate of tax, and 60 cents is the 
amount of tax, or percentage.
Table 15.2 illustrates some common ways that 
percent is used. The table helps clarify confusion 
about the terms percent and percentage. Because 
confusion is likely, a teacher must make it clear that 
percent indicates the rate (of sales tax, discount, in-
crease, or whatever), whereas percentage indicates 
the amount, or quantity (of tax, discount, increase, 
or whatever). Base and percentage always represent 
numbers that refer to the same units (dollars, cups 
of water, bottles of soda), and percent is the rate by 
which the percentage compares with the base.
Another point of confusion arises when a given 
percent is applied to different bases. Consider a 
price increase as an example: The price of a $5.00 
hat is increased 20% to $6.00. If, at a later time, the 
price is reduced back to $5.00, is the percent of de-
crease the same as the percent of increase? In both 
cases, the amount is the same; the price went up a 
dollar, and it came down a dollar.
The number lines in Figure 15.3 show that the 
rates in this increase-decrease setting are different. 
In Figure 15.3a, the ﬁ rst pair of segments represents 
the original price (blue segment), which was $5.00; 
and the price after it was increased to $6.00 (red 
segment). The increase is 
1
5
of the original line (red seg-
ment compared to blue seg-
ment). One out of 5 is 20% 
of the whole, so the rate of 
increase was 20%. In Figure 
15.3b, the blue segment rep-
resents the new base: $6.00. 
The decrease of $1.00 repre-
sented by the red segment is 
1
6 of the top line’s length (red 
segment compared to the 
blue segment). One out of 6 is 
0.16

3, so the rate of decrease is

3%, not 20%.

Teaching and Learning About Percent
The content readiness that children need before 
they are introduced to percent is an understanding 
of both common and decimal fractions. The peda-
gogical readiness required is an understanding of 
the learning aids they will use. During introduc-
tory and developmental activities, each whole unit 
or set should be one that is easily subdivided into 
100 parts. It is easier for children to understand the 
meaning of percent when they deal with portions 
of the 100 parts of a unit or collection of objects 
than when they deal with units or sets that cannot 
be partitioned into 100 parts. As children mature, 
they need experiences that relate percents to groups 
other than 100.
Although children need an understanding of 
common and decimal fractions before percent is 
introduced, mastery of fractions is not required. We 
recommend that early uses of percent can quickly 
follow initial experiences with common fractions 
and decimals. A percent is simply another way to 
represent common or decimal fractions. Some 
children ﬁ nd initial experiences with percent quite 
easy to understand because all percents are based 
on 100, in contrast to different denominators with 
common fractions and different powers of 10 with 
decimal fractions.
One introductory lesson (Activity 15.7) uses the 
same Cuisenaire materials used to introduce deci-
mal fractions. An assessment activity (Activity 15.8) 
provides an early assessment that links common 
fractions, decimal fractions, and percent to familiar 
area models. Activity 15.9 helps students develop 
common fraction, decimal fraction, and percent 
equivalents. In Activity 15.10 students estimate lin-
ear percentages and verify them with an elastic per-
cent ruler. In Activity 15.11 students consider percent 
in yet another context, money.
Children in grades 5 and 6 who have had experi-
ences that connect the three ways to represent frac-
tional numbers—common and decimal fractions 
and percent—will easily shift their thinking from 
one form to another. An exercise (see Figure 15.4) in 
which children convert forms can serve as a quick 
way to assess their ability to relate one representa-
tion to another.
Working with Percent
Students who successfully complete the percent 
concept-building activities in Figure 15.4 are ready 
to use percent to solve problems. Being able to ﬁ nd 
a percent of a number is based on knowledge of 
and skill in using common and decimal fractions 
to ﬁ nd parts of wholes and groups. For example, 
when a $50 item is on sale with a 40% discount, the 
amount of the discount is determined by ﬁ nding 
40% of 50 using either 0.4 of 50 or 
4
10 of 50. In either 
case the answer is determined by applying a known 
skill—multiplication with a decimal or common 
fraction—in a new situation. Here are examples of 
44, and 72. (Children may substitute 1 orange rod for 
every 10 white rods as they work.)
•  Write the numerals in a table like the one below.

should learn that common fractions, decimal fractions, and 
percent are all notations for parts of wholes and sets.

•  Older students could also write the simpliﬁ ed common 
fraction for the speciﬁ c day.
•  Students might keep their charts in a notebook or folder 
in the class, or collect their chart at the start of class to 
record their new Dollar Bill Day data and then return the 
chart to its place.
•  Periodically check the charts to be sure that students are 
recording information correctly, especially if you expect 
students to simplify the common fractions.
•  On Dollar Bill Day, commemorate the event by completing 
the class Dollar Bill Chart, and then have children com-
plete their own chart.

ACTIVITY 15.10
 
Elastic Percent Ruler
Level: Grades 4–6
Setting: Pairs of students
Objective: Students use the elastic percent ruler to help them 
estimate linear percentages.
Materials: 1.1-meter lengths of 
1
2-inch elastic, permanent markers, 
meter sticks, sticky notes, paper adding-machine tape
In this activity, children will make their own elastic per-
cent ruler by marking an elastic with percent markings.
•  Distribute a length of elastic to each pair of students. 
Direct students to mark one end of the elastic 0 and 
then mark every 10 centimeters until they reach 100 
centimeters, close to the other end of the elastic. The 
elastic should lie ﬂ at on a table or desk when students 
make their marks. It should be fully extended, but not be 
stretched.
•  Once students have ﬁ nished, have them check to be sure 
that their unstretched elastic percent ruler is the length of 
a meter stick.
•  Assign students various objects around the room to mea-
sure; the objects should be longer than a meter but not 
longer than the stretched elastic. Your desk, a panel of 
chalkboard, and the width/length of a window are some 
possibilities.
•  Students are to estimate speciﬁ c linear percentage lengths 
from one end of the object to the other, either marking 
them with chalk or pencil or placing a sticky note at the 
point they select. Some linear percentage lengths to ask 
students to mark are 30%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 10%, and 
40%.
•  After estimating, children should use their elastic percent 
ruler to ﬁ nd the actual linear percentage. They should 
continue with each percent, ﬁ rst estimating and then 
verifying with their elastic percent ruler.
•  As students are engaged in the activity, circulate to see 
how their estimation accuracy improves as they measure 
more objects with their elastic ruler.
•  As a culminating activity, give each group a random 
length of paper adding-machine tape (between 1.3 and 
2 meters in length). The group’s task is to mark and label 
with a pen several linear percentages that you assign. 
They then exchange paper tape with another group and 
use their elastic rulers to verify each other’s estimations.
situations that can be used to help children make 
this connection:
•  A basketball team sank 65% of 40 free throws in a 
game. How many free throws did the team make?
•  A gardener planted 20 tulips in a group. Seventy-
ﬁ ve percent were red. How many red tulips were 
there?
•  On average, 2.5% of the days in a year have a 
snowfall of at least 1 inch. What is the average 
number of days per year that have an inch or 
more of snow?
•  An auto shop sold 55% of 180 tires in July. How 
many tires did the auto shop sell?
By providing a mixture of situations, teachers can 
help children distinguish between situations that 
can be easily solved with mental computation—the 
tulip problem, in which students think “What is 
3
4 of 
20?” and compute the answer in their heads—and 
situations for which pencil and paper or a calculator 
is needed.
Some students might compute the free-throw 
situation mentally, thinking that 10% of 65 is 6.5, so 
40% of 65 is 4  6.5, or 26. Other students may rea-
son that 40 times 65 is 260 to determine that 26 is the 
answer. Do not pressure students who do not read-
ily understand explanations of classmates’ mental 
processes to adopt them for themselves. Over time,

Another Look at Percent
Level: Grades 4–6
Setting: Cooperative learning
Objective: Students develop a strategy for understanding percent.
Materials: Students select suitable manipulative materials. Every 
group needs paper and pencils plus two tables on butcher paper 
(overhead projector tables can be used).
•  This lesson uses a partners cooperative-learning format 
with four-member teams.
•  Tell this story: “A sixth-grade class had a cupcake sale 
to raise money for a trip. Ten students each baked four 
chocolate and six white cakes for the sale. What percent 
of Gleneece’s cakes were chocolate?”
•  Each pair of team members prepares a presentation, us-
ing manipulative materials or drawings, to illustrate and 
explain how they determined their answers. Team pairs 
share their presentations.
•  Add to the story: “Don baked four chocolate and six 
white cakes. How many cakes did he and Gleneece bake? 
What percent of the 20 cakes were chocolate cakes?”
•  Again, pairs illustrate and explain the situation to team 
partners.
•  Show a table that displays two entries that show what has 
been done so far.
Chocolate 
Number 
•  Point out that the table shows the relationships between 
chocolate cakes and all cakes when there are 10 and 20 
cakes. “Raise your hand to tell me what goes in the next 
column.” Have different students contribute as you com-
plete the table.
Chocolate 4 
8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 
40
Number 
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
•  Have children study the table and describe what they see. 
Possible responses: “The numbers in the top row increase 
by 4.” “The bottom numbers increase by 10.” “If you 
make common fractions of the top and bottom numbers 
you have a set of equivalent fractions.” “Each common 
fraction is equal to 40%.” “Each baker made 40% choco-
late cakes.”
•  Make a table for the white cakes; solicit comments about 
it. Probe for all ratio pairs representing the same percent.
Chocolate 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 
60
Number 
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
•  Children who know about ratios might recognize that 
they are dealing with a ratio setting. When they deter-
mine what percent each type of cake is of the total, they 
determine the ratio between a given type of cake and the 
total number of cakes. Another way of thinking about 
40% is to think of it as the part that 40 is of 100. The 
number of chocolate cakes baked compared with all cakes 
baked by each student can be represented as 4:10, and 
the percent as 40%.
•  Give each team a different, similar setting: “The town 
council ruled that 2 acres of every 10 acres of land in new 
developments was to be set aside as parkland. If there are 
50 acres of new development, how many acres of park-
land are there?” “Students at Bonheim School averaged a 
$3.00 proﬁ t on every $10.00 of sales in their school-sup-
ply store. If they had $120.00 worth of sales, how much 
was their proﬁ t?” Teams solve and share with classmates.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
students will construct their own understanding of 
those mental processes that make sense to them. 
A calculator is useful for computing increasingly 
complex problems involving percent, and children 
should learn to use them for this purpose.
In each of the preceding situations, the base and 
rate were known and multiplication by a common 
or decimal fraction determined the percentage. 
In other situations, the base and percentage are 
known and the percent is to be determined or the 
percent and percentage are known and the base is 
to be determined.
Consider the following three problems:
1.  A shirt is on sale at 25% off. The regular price of 
the shirt is $25.00. Find the discount.
2.  The number of students in an elementary school 
increased by 120. The school originally had 600 
students. By what percent did the number of 
students increase?
3.  Jim got 12 questions correct on his mathematics 
test. That was 80% of the number of items on the 
test. How many questions were on Jim’s test?
Each of these questions presents a different aspect 
of percent problems. In Question 1, the task is to 
determine the percentage, given the rate and the 
base. In Question 2, the task is to determine the rate, 
given the base and the percentage. In Question 3, 
the task is to determine the base, given the rate and 
the percentage.
In times past, these questions were designated 
Case I, Case II, and Case III, respectively. First, 
children identiﬁ ed the type of problem they were 
solving; then, they applied a memorized division 
or multiplication procedure to solve each type of 
problem. The focus was on memorizing rules rather 
than understanding the relationships in the prob-
lem. We suggest a different approach that builds on 
children’s knowledge of ratio and proportion and is 
developed in an intuitive way.
Recall the three terms associated with percent: 
base, rate, and percentage. Remember, too, that per-
cent means per 100. These terms are all part of the 
following problem:
•  A farmer plants 25% of his 200-acre farm with 
corn. How many acres are planted with corn?
A diagram of the farm (Figure 15.5) helps clarify the 
situation. Students who have a good understanding 
of fractional numbers, including percent, should 
readily recognize that if 25% of the 200-acre farm is 
planted with corn, that is the same as 
1
4 planted in 
corn, or 
1
4  200  50 acres planted in corn.
Pose another situation:
•  Look at the picture this way. It shows that part of 
the 200 acres is planted in corn. How many acres 
of corn does the picture show? (Answer: 50). 
What part of the 200 acres is the 50 acres? (An-
swer: 
1
4). One-quarter is the same as what percent? 
(Answer: 25).
Then present the situation differently:
•  If 50 acres of corn is 25% of the entire farm, how 
many acres are there on the farm? Fifty acres is 
what part of the farm? (Answer: 25%, or 
1
4). If 50 
acres is 
1
4 of the farm, how large is the farm? (An-
swer: 4  50, or 200 acres).
Following discussion, show a proportion for the ﬁ rst 
situation:
25

•  What does the 
25
100 represent? (Answer: the per-
cent of the farm in corn).
•  What does the 200 represent? (Answer: the size of 
the farm).
•  What does the question mark represent? (Answer: 
the acres planted in corn).

this a proportion? (Answer: 50).
Repeat this discussion with each of the other 
situations:

All three problems are represented in Table 15.3.
Another way to represent the problem is with a 
detailed diagram. If the diagram is drawn as shown 
in Figure 15.6, it can be used to easily answer any 
of the preceding questions. Notice that the farm is 
divided into 25% chunks that are labeled with the 
number of acres represented by each chunk.

A number line is another way to visualize these 
same problems (Figure 15.7). Draw a line with 0 at 
the left end and 100 at the right end. Divide it into 
10 equivalent parts, and put percent numbers along 
the bottom. The base for this situation—200—goes 
above the 100. Half the base is 100; write that above 
50 on the line. Have children tell where 50 and 
150 acres would go on the line. Use the line as you 
discuss the proportion situations involving acres 
of corn.
Proportional Reasoning and Percent
As children begin to apply proportional reasoning 
in their mathematics, they can do so with percents. 
The proportional relationship that can be used to 
solve all percent problems can be represented as 
follows:
part
whole  %
100
The ﬁ rst problems children solve using proportions 
should involve numbers that enable children to use 
chunking or equivalent fractions to ﬁ nd the solution. 
Only after much experience with proportionality 
situations will children be able to understand and 
use the cross-product algorithm. Only then should 
you use numbers that require the cross-product al-
gorithm in their computations.
Percent problems can be the setting for introduc-
ing algebraic processes and variables. In each of the 
proportions, a variable can be used to represent the 
missing term, and the resulting proportions can be 
solved using the cross-product algorithm.

Brieﬂ y describe a situation other than the cornﬁ eld 
that can be used to practice the proportion method 
of dealing with problems involving percent. How 
can you illustrate the situation? •••
Use what you know about percents to solve this 
problem: Flormart is selling a coat that normally 
costs $120 at 25% off. A competitor, Bullseye, sells 
the same coat for $150 but is offering it at 40% off. 
Which store has the better sale price for the coat?
Working with Percents 
Greater Than 100
There is one aspect of percent that proves confusing 
for students, even at the high school level: percents

greater than 100. Because teachers stress that per-
cent means what part of 100, students imagine that 
all percents are between 0 and 100. “After all,” they 
might reason, “how can you have more than 100% of 
anything?” When working with percent is restricted 
to physical models that represent a whole, and all 
percents are part of the whole, such a misconcep-
tion can become entrenched. Students need expe-
riences working in situations where percents are 
greater than 100. For example, if the price of a movie 
ticket increases from $4.00 to $9.00, the amount of 
the increase is $5.00. What is the percent of increase 
compared to the original price of a ticket?

Percents greater than 100 can also be shown with 
area models. Figure 15.8 shows 50% and 150% of the 
same-sized circle. When teachers provide many 
early experiences that portray percents greater 
than 100 along with common and decimal fractions 
greater than 1, students will not ﬁ nd such percents 
challenging once they become part of their regular 
study in upper middle school.

Dear Parents:
Children in your child’s class have been studying about percent and its uses. 
One way for students to connect with what they are doing in the classroom is 
to locate examples of the mathematics they are learning in real-world situa-
tions. You and your child can investigate uses of percent in newspapers and 
magazines and on television. We will discuss the results of students’ investiga-
tions in class next week.
This chart will help your child to record information to bring to class for the 
discussion. In the ﬁ rst column, name the magazine, newspaper, or television 
show. In the second column, brieﬂ y describe the situation—sale, population 
statistics, budget information, and so on. In the third column, write examples 
of information, such as a pie chart showing percents, percent off in a sale, 
and so on.

Please have your child bring the information to class on Tuesday the 14th.
Thank you.

Take-Home: Body Ratios
Here are directions for doing some body measure-
ments. Please ask a parent, other adult, or older 
brother or sister to assist you as you work.
 
Cut a length of string equal to your height. 
Use this string to gather some information about 
body ratios. How many times do you think your 
string will wrap around your neck? Predict ﬁ rst, 
then ﬁ nd out. What have you discovered? It takes 
the circumference of 
 necks to equal 1 
body height, or the circumference of 1 head equals 
 of my height. Write this information in 
ratio form. Repeat for your height and the circum-
ference of your head.
 
Use your string to ﬁ nd three or four other body 
ratios. For example, how many of one of your feet 
equals your height, or how many of one wrist cir-
cumference equals your waist? (Remember to pre-
dict ﬁ rst.) Do you think the same ratios would be 
true of babies? of adults? How could you ﬁ nd out? 
Use the information you have gathered about your 
body ratios to make a scale drawing of yourself. By 
what percent (or what fraction) will you have to 
reduce each of your measurements to ﬁ t on a page 
of your journal?
 
Write the results of your investigation in your 
journal. Be sure to tell which body parts ﬁ t each of 
the ratios you put in your journal.

Summary
Proportional reasoning is a key concept in mathematics, 
and children’s understanding of the multiplicative aspect 
of proportionality is apt to be slow in developing. Be sure 
to take the time that is needed for students to gain an un-
derstanding of proportions. The cross-product algorithm 
is the most efﬁ cient method for solving proportion prob-
lems, but it can cloud students’ understanding of propor-
tional situations. It should be the last method introduced 
to students for solving proportions, well along into the 
middle grades.
The use of common fractions to express ratios and 
solve problems involving proportions should be intro-
duced through simple examples of patterns and tables. 
Working with percent is closely related to working with ra-
tios and proportions and should be approached through 
situations involving proportions. Students’ solution strat-
egies for percent problems should develop from their un-
derstanding of percent and multiplicative relationships.
Two take-home activities presented in this chapter 
give children opportunities to explore uses of percent 
in newspapers and magazines and to extend their un-
derstanding of ratios by examining relationships among 
various parts of their bodies.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Compose two problems dealing with money, one 
that uses additive relationships and one that uses 
multiplicative relationships.
 2.  Why delay demonstrating to students the cross-
product algorithm for solving proportions?
 3.  What is the beneﬁ t to children to study introductory 
aspects of common fractions, decimal fractions, and 
percents at the same time?
 4.  Give two real-life examples of percents greater than 
100.
 5.  Draw a diagram and a number line to ﬁ t the follow-
ing situations. Write a proportion for each situation.
  a.  A mixture of coffee beans weighs 50 kilograms. 
If 48% of the beans are grown in Hawaii, how 
many kilograms of coffee are from Hawaii?
  b.  A mixture of coffee beans contains 24 kilograms 
of coffee grown in Hawaii. If this is 48% of the 
entire mixture, what is the total weight of the 
mixture?
  c.  A mixture of coffee that weighs 50 kilograms has 
24 kilograms of coffee grown in Hawaii. What 
percent of the mixture is coffee from Hawaii?
   Would you use this situation or the cornﬁ eld situa-
tion for children’s ﬁ rst experience with solving these 
types of problems? Why do you prefer your choice?

This book provides a number of interesting data 
tables that students in grades 4– 6 can use to make com-
parisons between the attributes of various physical ob-
jects. Children could be asked to ﬁ nd several ratios that 
interest them. The ratios might be rounded to single-
digit common fractions. The following are examples of 
possible ratios children might compute (Strauss, 1995):
•  The area of the Atlantic Ocean to the area of the 
Paciﬁ c Ocean (p. 126)
•  The area of a pool table to the area of a baseball 
diamond (p. 127)
•  The density of rubber to that of gold or platinum, or of 
tooth enamel (p. 130)
•  The kilowatt-hours used by a clock to the kilowatt-
hours used by a television, a fan, an air conditioner, or 
a hair dryer (p. 145)

three levels of difﬁ culty, and the reaction time can be 
adjusted in each level from slow to fast.
 
In the game the numerical representations can be

Thinking 
Algebraically
 chapter on algebra in a book that focuses on mathematics 
at the K– 6 level may surprise new teachers. After all, most 
people remember algebra as a dance of symbols with a 
goal of solving for x. Algebra was a high school course 
where they studied equations and graphing. But algebra is 
more than solving for x; it is a study of patterns, functions, and relationships. 
Algebra allows students to generalize from arithmetic to discern relation-
ships, to make predictions from observed patterns, and to use a power-
ful problem-solving tool to solve problems. In short, algebra is a way for 
students to “recognize order and organize their world” (National Council 
of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000, p. 91).

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
In this chapter we focus on three aspects of alge-
braic reasoning: patterns, equations and variables, 
and functions. The study 
of each of these begins in 
the primary grades and 
extends through the entire 
mathematics curriculum, 
to high school grades and 
beyond. In truth, the foun-
dation for the develop-
ment of algebraic thinking 
begins at the lowest grades 
and continues through the 
entire elementary school 
mathematics 
program. 
NCTM has designated al-
gebra as one of the ﬁ ve 
content standards for school mathematics. The al-
gebra standards for younger children are:
NCTM Algebra Standard
Algebra instructional programs from prekindergarten 
through grade 12 should enable all students to:
Understand patterns, relations, and functions
Pre-K– 2 Expectations:
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  sort, classify, and order objects by size, number, and other 
properties;
•  recognize, describe, and extend patterns such as se-
quences of sounds and shapes or simple numeric patterns 
and translate from one representation to another;
•  analyze how both repeating and growing patterns are 
generated.
Represent and analyze mathematical situations and 
structures using algebraic symbols
Pre-K– 2 Expectations:
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  illustrate general principles and properties of operations, 
such as commutativity, using speciﬁ c numbers;
•  use concrete, pictorial, and verbal representations to de-
velop an understanding of invented and conventional 
symbolic notations.
Use mathematical models to represent and under-
stand quantitative relationships
Pre-K– 2 Expectations:
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  model situations that involve the addition and subtraction 
of whole numbers, using objects, pictures, and symbols.
Analyze change in various contexts
Pre-K– 2 Expectations:
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  describe qualitative change, such as a student’s growing 
taller;
•  describe quantitative change, such as a student’s growing 
two inches in one year.
The NCTM standards move algebra beyond simply 
solving for x or graphing lines. The focus of algebraic 
thinking in the lower grades is to analyze change 
by observing and extending patterns. Algebraic 
thinking provides tools to children to represent re-
lationships that they observe through patterns and 
then generalize these relationships to represent the 
changes they can observe in various contexts.
What Teachers Should Know 
About Teaching Algebra
Algebra is the study of patterns and numerical re-
lationships. Children who are able to form patterns 
build a foundation for the algebraic concept of func-
tions. Patterning is the concept of functions that is 
central to algebra. Students use functions to gener-
alize a relationship from patterns they have formed. 
The ability to generalize a relationship from speciﬁ c 
data is a hallmark of algebraic reasoning. For ex-
ample, the following table shows the temperature 
and the number of cricket chirps recorded in 15 
seconds:
Chirps in 15 seconds 
10 
15 
20 
25
Temperature 
49 
54 
59 
64
From these data a generalization is that to ﬁ nd the 
temperature, add 39 to the number of cricket chirps. 
Teachers can help students develop algebraic think-
ing by providing many experiences with generating 
data and formulating functional relationships; by 
working through these activities, students will learn 
to avoid simply manipulating numbers and symbols 
in equations. Another key concept in algebra is the 
balance aspect of equations. Students need to un-
derstand that the equal 
sign in an equation indi-
cates a balance or equal-
ity between the numerical 
expressions on both sides 
of the equation.
Patterning as Algebraic Thinking
Humans use patterns to make sense of a chaotic and 
seemingly random world of experiences. By ﬁ nding 
and using patterns, humans develop concepts and 
skills for living. Patterns occur in natural and human-
designed settings. Trees and plants are recognized 

 
Chapter 16 Thinking Algebraically 
359
by the patterns of their leaves, shape, 
and bark. By recognizing which 
trees and plants had curative value, 
people in many cultures developed 
medicines and avoided plants that 
were poisonous. In art, architecture, 
and design, patterns create unity 
and harmony through repetitions 
of colors and shapes (Figure 16.1). 
Repetition of melodies and rhythm 
bring unity to music from Bach and 
Mozart to Prince and Eminem.
Science is based on identify-
ing regular and predictable occur-
rences in the physical world. What 
weather factors predict the occur-
rence of tornadoes and hurricanes? 
What inﬂ uence does El Niño or La 
Niña have on weather patterns? New 
elements were predicted even be-
fore they were discovered because 
physicists and chemists recognized 
patterns in the periodic table of el-
ements. Good readers and writers 
use word and letter patterns when 
they decode or spell similar words (enough, tough, 
rough), although English has many irregularities that 
confuse children and adults (bough, gruff).
Many patterns are also found in mathematics be-
cause mathematics is a way of describing the events 
in the world. Prime and composite numbers, odd 
and even numbers, and square numbers are pat-
terned sequences of numbers. For example,

of negative powers of 10:

solving.

Patterns in Mathematics Learning 
and Teaching
Patterning is a central element in algebraic think-
ing. Patterns are generally deﬁ ned as a repeated 
sequence of objects, actions, sounds, or symbols. 
Starting with simple patterns, children recognize, 
represent, extend, and create patterns with different 
arrangements of elements. A simple pattern with 
two elements repeated can take many forms.
People: boy-girl, boy-girl, . . .
Blocks: red-white, red-white, . . .
Actions: snap-clap, snap-clap, . . .
Sounds: quack-moo, quack-moo, . . .
Symbols: A-B, A-B, . . .
The speciﬁ c objects, events, or actions change, but 
the pattern is the same. Patterns may have three ele-
ments repeated, as in A-A-B/A-A-B, or four elements 
repeated, as in A-B-C-B/A-B-C-B. Patterns may pro-
gress or change, such as 
A-B-C/B-C-D/C-D-E or A-A-
B/A-A-C/A-A-D. Numerical 
patterns may increase or 
decrease in value or dem-
onstrate other relation-
ships and rules.
Children learn about 
patterns with simple ac-
tivities, but the goal in 
patterning exercises is 
to recognize patterns in 
many situations. When 
children recognize a pat-
tern, as with the cricket 
chirp data, they are be-
ginning to think algebra-
ically. Kindergarten and

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
primary-grade children learn visual, word, and 
sound patterns. When children learn to play pat-
terns with musical instruments, they develop skills 
used in reading sentences and words. Rhyming 
words, short and long vowel sounds, and preﬁ xes 
and sufﬁ xes are other important patterns in reading. 
While teaching patterns to primary children, teach-
ers should emphasize general skills of ﬁ nding, ex-
tending, and making different patterns rather than 
limit instruction to one or two examples.
Patterns can be explored in a classroom pattern 
center supplied with rubber stamps and paper, col-
ored beads and cord, pegboards and golf tees, pat-
tern blocks, small colored tiles, and colored disks. 
Task cards can guide children in their pattern work 
(Figure 16.2). In the art 
center shapes cut from 
construction paper are 
glued to paper to show pat-
terns. Patterned beats of a 
drum or rhythmic hand-
claps help young children 
recognize auditory pat-
terns. As children mature, 
they represent visual or 
rhythmic patterns in other 
forms. Activities 16.1 and 
16.2 suggest other ways teachers might introduce 
patterns and help students represent patterns in sev-
eral different ways.
overlap in more complex ways than A-B-C. A jump-
ing game using number lines or a hundreds chart 
illustrates number patterns that begin with simple 
rules but progress in complexity. Students follow 
the directions and record the sequence of numbers 
that results from moving forward and back (adapted 
from Greenes et al., 2001, pp. 22– 23):
Rule: Start at 2, jump 3 spaces forward 4 times. 
Where do you land?
Rule: Start at 0, jump 3 spaces forward and 1 space 
back. Repeat 3 times. Keep track of all the numbers 
you landed on.
Rule: Start at 1. Jump forward 1. Where did you 
land? Jump that number forward. Repeat 3 times.
Rule: Start at 1. Jump forward 1. Where did you 
land? Double the number and jump forward. Re-
peat 3 times.
When students follow the rules, they create a 
number pattern. Then they invent a rule to challenge 
classmates. This pattern activity models addition 
and subtraction on the number line and helps them 
see how the number system works. For children in 
grades 2– 4 the teacher can begin with simple num-
ber or letter sequences and ask students to ﬁ nd the 
next term in the sequence and then explain the rule 
they used:
2, 6, 14, 26, 42, 62, . . .

MISCONCEPTION
Some students examine only the ﬁ rst two terms of a series 
and then try to determine all subsequent terms in the series, 
regardless of what other terms follow. This approach works 
if all terms show the same increase or decrease. However, 
consider this pattern: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, . . . . The difference between 
the ﬁ rst two terms (2) is not the difference for subsequent 
terms. A student who used the 2 rule from the ﬁ rst two terms 
would mistakenly conjecture that the next term in this series is 
17 (15  2).
Patterning is a broader skill than learning the A-
B pattern. Intermediate-grade students (grades 3– 5) 
work with patterns that increase, decrease, and 

ACTIVITY 16.2
 
One Pattern with Five Representations
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students demonstrate ﬁ ve different representations of 
a pattern.
Materials: Sentence strips with drawn and symbol patterns
•  Begin with a display of geometric shapes cut from one 
color of poster board. Read the pattern with the children 
in unison—for example, square-circle-triangle, square-
circle-triangle, . . . .
•  Ask children to name the shapes in the pattern. Have 
them tell how many shapes are in one sequence, and 
where the sequence begins and ends.
•  Ask: “What action could we make every time we see the 
square, the circle, the triangle?” Take the suggestions 
and perform the actions—for example, stomp-clap-snap, 
stomp-clap-snap, . . . .
•  Ask: “What sound could we make every time we see the 
square, the circle, the triangle?” Take the suggestions and 
make the sounds, such as oink-moo-meow.
•  Ask: “Could we use alphabet letters to show this se-
quence?” Students may suggest different letter combina-
tions, such as S-C-T. Tell them that they can choose any 
three letters to represent the pattern. Many times the 
letters A, B, C, D, and so forth are used to represent the 
elements in a pattern.
•  Show other patterns on sentence strips or tagboard, and 
have students act out, make sounds, or use symbols to 
represent the same pattern. Let students continue the 
pattern.
ACTIVITY 16.1
 
Making Rhythm Patterns
Level: Grades Pre-K– 2
Setting: Small groups or whole group
Objective: Students make auditory patterns with percussion 
instruments.
Materials: Drum, cymbals, rhythm sticks, tambourine, and tone 
block
•  Children sit in a circle. Begin beating the drum with a 
steady beat: thump, thump, thump. Children clap with the 
rhythm.
•  After the students can keep the steady rhythm, ask them 
to listen to a new pattern. Instead of beating regularly, 
introduce pauses in the pattern: Thump-thump-pause, 
thump-thump-pause, . . . Thump-pause, thump-pause, 
thump-pause, . . .
•  Have students join as soon as they understand the pat-
tern. Nodding the head for the pause is a good way to 
maintain the rhythm.
•  Ask volunteers to model a pattern of beats using another 
rhythm instrument, and have others join in with their 
instruments or by clapping.
•  Ask two or three students to demonstrate patterns with 
combinations of instruments. Students can stand in a row 
and repeat the sequence.
•  triangle, drum, cymbals  triangle, drum, cymbals 
sticks, sticks, bell  sticks, sticks, bell
•  Introduce pictures of the instruments on cards, and 
rearrange the cards to show different combinations of 
instruments and different sequences. Have students with 
different instruments play their instruments in the pattern 
shown.
•  Ask questions about which instruments are in each se-
quence, if any instruments play more than once, and how 
many sounds are in each sequence.

ACTIVITY 16.3
 
Exploring Patterns with Pattern Blocks
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students discern and extend patterns using pattern 
blocks.
Materials: Pattern blocks
•  Draw the following design on the board, and ask students 
to make it using their pattern blocks:
•  Have students extend the pattern, as shown here:
•  Ask students to extend the pattern to the next stage.
•  Once children have completed Stage 3 of the pattern, ask 
them to explain how they would make Stage 4 of the pat-
tern. Discuss how many new shapes are needed for this 
stage and the next two stages.
•  Have students record their data for the ﬁ rst three stages 
in a table.
Stage 
1 
2 
3
Squares 
1 
2 
3
Triangles

8
•  Have students extend the data table for Stage 4 and 
Stage 5, and then build each stage to check their data. 
Have students discuss how they knew what shapes to use 
before they built each stage.
•  Ask older students to use the pattern to answer the fol-
lowing questions:
• If there are 6 squares, how many triangles are there?
• If there are 8 squares, how many triangles are there?
• If there are 10 squares, how many triangles are there?
• If there are 20 squares, how many triangles are there?
For many people the word pattern calls to mind a 
geometric design or template for creating a piece of 
clothing, such as a dress pattern. Children can use 
geometric shapes to explore patterns. Activity 16.3 
uses pattern blocks to extend children’s knowledge 
about patterns.
Activity 16.4 uses patterns of children’s names. 
When a child’s name is the pattern train, the chil-
dren can observe patterns to when speciﬁ c letters 
appear in the pattern. For example, note the pattern 
train shown for the name Juni, J-U-N-I. This four-let-
ter train then repeats to form the pattern:
1
J
2
U
3
N
4
I
5
J
6
U
7
N
8
I
9
J
10
U
The pattern for the letter N is 3, 7, 11, 15, . . . . Chil-
dren can conjecture about the next two squares that 
contain N. Similarly, they 
can observe patterns with 
other letters in their name. 
In this activity and in many 
other pattern explorations, 
children could use a calcu-
lator. For example, the let-
ter J appears in every four 
squares. Thus, starting 
at Box 1, students could 
press 4 repeatedly to 
ﬁ nd the subsequent terms 
or boxes that will contain J 
in the JUNI pattern.
Many patterns are also 
observable on a hundreds 
chart. Multiples of 2 end

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
Many of the early advancements in algebra were due to 
Arabic and Persian mathematicians in the Middle Ages. The 
word algebra is from the title of a book written by Persian 
scholar Al-Khwarizmi in A.D.825. The title was Hisab al-jabr 
w’al-muqabalah, which loosely translated means “the sci-
ence of reunion and reduction.”

in 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0. Multiples of 5 form two columns 
of numbers that end in 0 or 5. Children can exam-
ine these and other patterns to describe the visual 
pattern that the multiples form and the characteris-
tics of the numbers in the visual pattern. Figure 16.3 
shows the multiples of 9 on a hundreds chart. The 
multiples form a diagonal. The numbers in the mul-
tiples pattern for 9 all have digits that sum to 9.
Young children can use patterns in many settings 
beyond mathematics. At the end of this chapter we 
describe how children can use patterns when they 
read the storybook And Meatballs for All, by Marilyn 
Burns, and The Rajah’s Rice, by David Barry. In both 
stories children can use patterns to extend the story 
line and add to the information in the books.
Variables and Equations 
in Mathematics 
and Algebraic Thinking
Using variables, or symbols, to represent numbers is 
a fairly new development in mathematics. Variables 
became part of formal mathematics only about 400 
years ago. For thousands of years before the 17th cen-
tury, mathematicians had struggled with mathemati-
cal expressions, in some cases using entire words to 
refer to the unknown quantity in an equation. The 
point here is that the concept of using variables to 
replace unknown numbers is not as obvious as it 
may appear. If it took mathematicians thousands of 
years to develop the concept of variables, it is un-
derstandable that the topic may be challenging for 
students today.
ACTIVITY 16.4
 
Exploring Letter Patterns in a Name
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Individual
Objective: Students discern and extend letter patterns.
Materials: Graph paper
•  Write out three pattern trains of a child’s name, such as 
Logan.
•  Ask students to predict the next two terms of the pattern. 
Ask students to explain their answer.
•  Ask students when the letter A will next appear in the 
pattern. (Answer: term 14.)
•  Discuss students’ conjectures, and continue the pattern to 
verify the answer.

•  Have students write out three pattern trains for their 
name on graph paper. Be sure that students number each 
square.
•  Challenge students to use their pattern to answer the fol-
lowing questions:
•  When will three of the letters in their name next 
appear?
• What letter will be in term 20? in term 30? in term 50?
•  How many times will the ﬁ rst letter in their name ap-
pear in the ﬁ rst 30 terms? in the ﬁ rst 50 terms? in the 
ﬁ rst 100 terms?
•  Children could also write their name to ﬁ ll in a 4  4 array 
of squares. The task would be to predict what letter falls 
in the last square. The task could be repeated with a 5  
5 or 6  6 array.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Variables 
are 
com-
monly used in mathemat-
ics in several ways:
1.  2x  10
2.  5y  30
3.      12
4.  A  bh
5.  F  9
5C  32
The ﬁ rst statement, an 
open sentence, is true or 
false depending on the 
value that x represents. If x 
represents 5, then the sen-
tence or equation is true. 
If x represents another 
value, then the sentence 
is false. Open sentences 
are typical of the types 
of equations that younger 
children work with in 
mathematics. The goal is 
to determine the value for 
x that makes the sentence 
or equation true.
Statement 2 is an inequality. The variable y rep-
resents an inﬁ nite number of values, any value less 
than 6. Children have difﬁ culty with the ambiguity of 
inequalities. There are an inﬁ nite number of values 
that will make the inequality true. Thus y can repre-
sent an inﬁ nite number of values. This contradicts 
most of what mathematics has been for students, a 
study of problems and challenges that have a single 
answer, not a multitude of possible solutions.
The equation in Statement 3 has shapes to hold a 
number. Younger children are familiar with number 
sentences with a missing value, usually represented 
by a box, a blank, or a question mark. Equation 
(1) could have been easily represented as 2  10. 
The value for either  or  cannot be determined 
independently. Once a value is selected for , say 
7, then the value of  can be determined (5). This 
relationship is called a function and is developed 
more fully later in this chapter. Note that there are 
an inﬁ nite number of value pairs that  and  could 
represent.
Statement 4 represents the formula for the area 
of a rectangle, where b is the length of the base, h 
is the height, and A is the area. These letters repre-
sent real-world relationships, much as variables do 
in other formulas.
Finally, Statement 5 is an equation that repre-
sents the relationship between Fahrenheit and Cel-
sius temperatures. The variables refer to a speciﬁ c 
temperature measurement system.
With so many different uses of variables in math-
ematics it is important that teachers provide stu-
dents with foundational experiences using variables 
in equations so that students clearly understand the 
role of variables in representing numbers. The chal-
lenge is compounded by the use of letters as names 
MISCONCEPTION
Once students begin 
to use variables, they 
focus on the value that 
the variable represents. 
One consequence is that 
for many students each 
variable in an equation 
must have its own value 
and no two variables can 
have the same value. For 
instance, many children 
would consider x  4  
4  y to be false, because 
they mistakenly reason 
that x and y cannot have 
the same value. Similarly, 
many students would 
say q  r must be false, 
without knowing anything 
about either value that 
these variables represent. 
Again they mistakenly 
assume that two different 
variables must represent 
different quantities.
Research for the Classroom
•
In the recent past mathematics educators advised against 
using variables in primary grades. Rather than asking chil-
dren to solve an equation with an unknown, such as
X  5  7
teachers were advised to use a blank, an empty box, or a 
similar construct to represent the missing value:
__  5  7
 ?  5  7
  5  7
The concept of variable was regarded as a difﬁ cult concept 
to understand. With number sentences such as those 
shown here, children could still engage in algebraic think-
ing without the concept of variable to further confuse 
them.
 
Recent research ﬁ ndings indicate that even young 
children can use variables to represent unknowns and 
then solve for the numbers that the variables represent. 
Researchers concluded that children as young as ﬁ rst-
graders can conﬁ dently use variables in number sentences 
and equations. Proper experiences are required to intro-
duce the concept of variable, and supporting activities 
must support their understandings. With proper classroom 
experiences such as the activities that follow, the evidence 
suggests that even the youngest children can work 
with variables (Carraher et al., 2006; Tsankova, 2003; 
Dobrynina, 2001).

ACTIVITY 16.5
 
What Number Is Hiding?
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students solve for the missing value in a number 
sentence.
Material: Poster board or oak tagboard
•  Write the number sentence 3  4  7 on the poster 
board.
•  Hold up the poster board but cover the 4 with your hand. 
Ask students to discuss the missing number in the group.
•  Have one group present their ﬁ ndings and the reason for 
their answer.
•  Hold up the poster board again, but remove your hand to 
reveal the number.
•  Repeat with several more challenges.
•  Ask each group to write out 10 number sentences.
•  Groups challenge each other to ﬁ nd the missing num-
ber in the number sentences they have created. When a 
group shows a number sentence to another group, one 
person holds a ﬁ nger over one number for the other 
group to ﬁ nd and someone from the group being chal-
lenged writes out the completed number sentence.
ACTIVITY 16.6
 
“How Many Are Hiding?” (Reasoning and Proof)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Groups of four students
Objective: Students determine how many chips are “hiding” 
beneath the index card.
Materials: Counters, ﬁ le cards
•  Arrange some chips on a desk, and hide some beneath a 
ﬁ le card, as shown here:
•  Tell students that there are eight chips altogether but that 
some are hiding behind the card. Ask students how many 
chips are hiding under the card.
•  Allow groups to work out their answer, and then ask for 
an explanation from a group.
•  Pairs work in the groups to design four challenge prob-
lems like this one.
•  Each pair presents their problems to the other pair in their 
group by arranging the proper number of counters and 
writing the total number of chips (hidden and exposed) 
on the ﬁ le card, as shown here:

•  If the pairs do not agree about a problem solution, the 
class can observe, question, and decide on the correct 
solution.
•  Each pair selects their best problem to present to the 
class.
or designations in nonmathematical settings, such 
as Exit 44A, grades of A or B, outline subheadings, 
and newspaper comics on page 4E. In none of these 
cases does the designation of a letter indicate any 
numerical representation. Rather, the letters are 
used as a designation or name for the item. It is un-
derstandable how children can have difﬁ culty un-
derstanding the proper role and use of variables in 
mathematics.
Whether a teacher chooses to use a letter, an 
empty box, a question mark, or a dash to represent a 
missing number in a sentence, children need many 
experiences with open sentences. Activities 16.5 
and 16.6 provide different experiences with open 
sentences. In Activity 16.5 students hide one term 
of the sentence and challenge others to determine 
the hidden number and then write the complete 
sentence. In Activity 16.6 a ﬁle card is used to hide 

some chips. Students are challenged to determine 
how many chips are hiding.
In each of these and 
similar activities, teachers 
should ask for the value 
that makes the equation 
true, rather than simply 
“What’s 
the 
number?” 
Although the difference 
may seem subtle, asking 
for the value that makes 
the equation true implies 
that the variable may take 
many possible values but 
that only one value will 
balance or make true the 
given equation or number 
sentence. When students 
build such a conceptual understanding of variable 
and equation from the beginning, they are better able 
to maintain these concepts when they are perform-
ing more complex operations within equations.
Students continue to expand their experiences 
with variables with activities such as Activities 16.7 
and 16.8. In Activity 16.7 students represent equa-
tions using playing cards. In Activity 16.8 students 
are challenged to solve open sentences with many 
different representations of a missing value, includ-
ing letters as variables. When students have many 
experiences with variables, they are less likely to 
think of algebra as a process of symbol manipula-
tion to solve for an unknown.
One ﬁ nal aspect about variables for younger chil-
dren is when there is no single value that the variable 
represents. Students, even through high school, are 
so accustomed to ﬁ nding the answer to any math-
ematics problem that an equation with more than 
one value for a variable is difﬁ cult to understand. 
The ambiguity of multiple answers is the challenge 
for teachers as they encourage students to think 
about all the possible answers that could be true.
One way to have younger children begin to work 
with multiple solutions to a problem story is to use 
a table. For example, “Juanita has 10 pencils. Some 
are blue and some are red. How many blue pencils 
and how many red pencils does she have?”
Blue  Red  10

Older 
children 
would 
work with a different form 
of the equation to repre-
sent this situation: a  b 
 10. There are 10 pairs 
of solution values for this 
problem. 
Activity 
16.9 
uses such a problem to 
develop children’s sense 
of a variable.
ACTIVITY 16.7
 
What Does the Card Say?
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students determine the value of a playing card.
Material: Playing cards with no picture cards
•  Hold up two cards for all the class to 
see, one facing the class, one facing 
you.
•  Ask students to guess the value of the 
card they cannot see. Probe that there 
is no way to be sure of its value.
•  Form a number sentence with the two cards, either addi-
tion or subtraction. Now ask for the value of the unknown 
card. Have students explain their strategies to solve for the 
unknown card.
• 8  ?  3
•  Repeat with other pairs of cards.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
MISCONCEPTION
Many textbooks suggest 
using a variable that 
is related to the item it 
represents—for example, 
using t for the number of 
tiles or c for the number 
of children. This can be 
a helpful strategy to help 
in recalling what each 
variable represents, but 
students tend to think of 
the variable as the actual 
item, thus 2t would rep-
resent two tiles not twice 
the number of tiles.
MISCONCEPTION
In an equation such as 
x  y  14 many children 
will ﬁ nd all addend pairs 
except 7, 7. They reason 
that because there are 
two different letters in the 
equation, they must each 
represent two different 
values. Students learn 
from examples in which 
both variables have the 
same value.

ACTIVITY 16.8
 
Replacing the Number
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Pairs
Objective: Students solve for the missing number in number 
sentences.
•  Write the number sentence 3  5  8 on the board.
•  Erase one of the numbers and replace it with a question 
mark. Ask students for the missing number.
•  Repeat with many different symbols, replacing each of 
the three numbers in random order. Each time ask for the 
number that is “hiding” behind the symbol. Be sure to 
write the answer in the form of, for example, x  11 for 
each problem.
•  Pass out these problems (see Black-Line Master 16.1) for 
each pair of students to solve.
 1.  q  4  9
 2.  x  3  8
 3.    8  3
 4.  6  r  13
 5.  8  t  2
 6.  ♥  7  16

 9.    7  10
 10.    2  1
 11.  ?  3  10
 12.  5  __  6
ACTIVITY 16.9
 
Multiple Value Variables
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students ﬁ nd all possible values for variables in an 
equation.
Materials: None
•  Post this equation on the board:     6
•  Ask students to volunteer possible answers. Post answers 
on the board.
•  Ask for an explanation for each pair given. Look for 
students selecting a value of one variable and computing 
the other.
•  Challenge students to ﬁ nd all the possible value pairs for 
    10.
Extension
•  Students in upper elementary grades might examine the 
pairs of addends by graphing them. They could represent 
the data in a t-chart ﬁ rst, then graph the data to observe 
the relationship between the two addends in a graphical 
representation.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Equations in Algebraic Thinking
Equations are a powerful means of expressing 
mathematical relationships, from area formulas and 
temperature conversions to representations of word 
problems. Centuries of mathematical thought have 
reﬁ ned both how to write and how to solve equa-
tions, resulting in an efﬁ cient universal process for 
solving many different types of mathematics prob-
lems. The central feature of an equation is that it 
shows the equality of two quantities in a relation -
ship as simple as 2  2  4 or as complex as x2  
5x  6. In all equations the equal sign indicates 
equality between the two quantities.
One way to think of an equation is as a balance, 
with each side of the equation representing a quantity 
on a scale or pan balance. 
If the quantities are equal 
or the same, then they bal-
ance. In any equation this 
balance aspect must be 
maintained or the equal 
sign is no longer valid. Con-
sider the number sentence 
8  @  11. The equation 
will balance if and only if 
@ is 3. If any other value re-
places @ (e.g., 5), then the 
equation will not balance, 
and the equation with 
5 replacing @ will not be 
true (8  5  11).
This balance aspect 
of an equation may seem 
straightforward, but it is 
fairly challenging for stu-
dents to internalize. Many 
students can routinely ma-
nipulate symbols about 
an equation in an algebra 
class but lack this funda-
mental understanding of 
an equation. As a result, 
these students run into 
difﬁ culty if an equation or 
a problem diverges in any 
respect from the practice problems they have been 
solving. Their memorized rote procedures have over -
whelmed any real understanding of the fundamen-
tal balance aspect of equations.
Some activities stress the balance aspect of an 
equation and make explicit use of an actual bal-
ance. The balance pictured here enables students to 
place blocks at marked positions on each balance 
arm to represent numeri-
cal value. For example, 
students could use such 
a scale to represent and 
then solve 3x  18. First 
students would put a block 
in the 8 position and a 
block in the 10 position on 
one balance arm. The task 
is then to put three blocks 
in the same position on 
the other arm to balance 
8  10. If three blocks are 
put on the 6 position, then 
the two quantities balance 
and in the equation 3x  18, x  6. Some students 
understand an expression such as 3x to represent 
a number in the 30s, because they see a 3 in what 
they understand to be the tens place, leaving only 
the ones place to be determined.
MISCONCEPTION
For some younger students 
the equal sign in a number 
sentence such as 4  5  ? 
does not carry the mean-
ing of equals or equality. 
Rather, they understand 
the equal sign to mean 
“The answer is coming” or 
“Get ready to do some-
thing” or even “Write a 
number.” These students 
would have no difﬁ culty 
solving the problem 3  
4  ? but might be unable 
to solve ?  3  4 because 
“there is nothing to do.” 
Similarly in the number 
sentence 8  4  ?  4, 
these students will write in 
12 as if the problem were 
simply 8  4  ?. Another 
common error is to solve 
the missing number as 
16. In this case all the 
numbers were added 
because a plus sign was 
in the example. In neither 
of these cases would a 
student demonstrate any 
clear understanding of 
the balance aspect of an 
equation.
Balance scale
Classroom products
Younger children should have some experiences 
using balance scales from their work with measure-
ment activities (see Chapter 18). Activity 16.10 uses 
a balance scale to develop the understanding of 
equality in number sentences and equations.
After some experiences children can move from 
real pan balances to drawings of pan balances. The 
balance scales (Figure 16.4) help children begin to 

use the balance concept as a means to determine 
the value of an unknown. With the ﬁ rst scale stu-
dents could draw the scale and then mimic remov-
ing two carrot sticks from each pan, resulting in one 
tangerine balancing six carrot sticks. With the sec-
ond balance scale students can remove two carrot 
sticks from each pan to determine that one tanger-
ine balances nine celery sticks.
Several more experiences balancing real objects 
will help students become comfortable with the bal-
ance concept, which we discuss further with draw-
ings of blocks. Note that in each example the blocks 
have different relationships.
•  How much does a sphere weigh?
In this problem a student could reason that by tak-
ing off one cube from each balance pan, the scale 
would still balance. That would leave one sphere on 
one balance pan and two cubes on the other pan. 
So one sphere balances two cubes.
5
•  How much does a cube weigh?
In this problem a sphere weighs 5 kilograms. The 
student can use this information with the second 
balance to determine how many kilograms a cube 
weighs. A cube weighs as much as two spheres, or 
10 kilograms.
Activities 16.11 and 16.12 focus on each of these 
uses of a balance to represent an equation.
Functions in Algebraic Thinking
The idea of functions is a central concept to alge-
braic reasoning. A function is the pairing of mem-
bers of two sets so that given the value of a member 
of one set, the related member of the second set can 
be predicted or determined. The cricket chirp data 
are an example of a function. Reasoning with func-
tions is common in everyday life. When determin-
ing the cost of 3 pounds of bananas, where 1 pound 
costs $0.59 per pound, we use a function (3  price 
per pound, or 3  $0.59) to compute the price of 3 
pounds ($1.77). Determining sales tax for an item 
involves functions. Estimating how far we can drive 
on a full tank of gas also uses a function. If a car trav-
els 25 miles on 1 gallon of gas, it will travel 250 miles 
on 10 gallons and 500 miles on 20 gallons.
Functions are really a generalization of speciﬁ c 
relationships. The power of algebraic reasoning is 
generalization from speciﬁ c cases to general re-
lationships. The role of a function is to reveal the 
general relationship or to produce a result based on 
the general relationship. Thus a cook can use the 
general function of 1 hour of cooking for every 3 
pounds of turkey (cooking hours  pounds  3) to 
determine that a 15-pound bird must be cooked for 
5 hours:

subsequent terms is to add 2. To determine the tenth 
term in this pattern, a child would have to determine 
the ﬁ rst nine terms (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) and 
then add 2 to the ninth term to ﬁ nd the tenth term 
(20). When a student can state a function that de-
scribes a pattern, she does not have to list all the 
preceding terms to ﬁ nd the tenth (or any) term. The 
rule, or function, for determining any term in the 
above pattern is 2n, where n is the term position in 
the pattern. Thus the tenth term is 2(10), or 20, and 
the hundredth term is 2(100), or 200. Every term has 
a speciﬁ c value. An important feature of a function 
is that every term or value in the ﬁ rst set has one, 
and only one, resulting value in the second set. The 
graphic display in Figure 16.5 can help to illustrate 
the characteristics of a function. Notice the three 
sets in Figure 16.5. The relationship between the sets

Balancing Bears (Representation)
Level: Grades K– 3
Setting: Learning center
Objective: Students explore the concept of equality using 
weighted bears.
Materials: Pan balance, weighted bears, number scale, double arm 
scale
•  Place a pan balance in the mathematics center with an 
assortment of weighted bears. Students put bears of dif-
ferent sizes on each side of the scale.
•  Ask the students if they see a pattern or relationship 
between the weight of the small, medium-size, and big 
bears. For example, how many small bears balance a large 
bear?
•  Put other small objects in the center for students to weigh 
with bears. Have students draw or write their observations 
about how many bears balance each object. For example:
•  A pencil weighs more than a small bear but less than a 
big bear.
•  A book is too heavy to use. There are not enough bears 
to balance it.
•  Three middle bears weigh the same as the staple 
remover.
•  One small, two middle, and three large bears weigh the 
same as a tennis ball.
•  Place a number scale with weighted numbers (shown 
here) or a balance scale in the center for further explora-
tion. You may tape an equal sign at the pivot point of the 
balance. Students place numbers on either side to make 
equations that balance: 2  3  1  4, 5  5  2  1  
7, and the like.

may or may not represent the deﬁ nition of a func-
tion, depending on how the members of set Q {A, B, 
C} are paired with the members of set R {1, 2, 3}.
In Figure 16.5a each member of set {A, B, C} 
is paired with only one member of set {1, 2, 3}, so 
the relationship between the two sets represents a 
function. Figure 16.5b also shows a function. Even 
though two members of {A, B, C} are paired with 
1 in {1, 2, 3}, the ﬁ gure still represents a function, 
because every member of {A, B, C} is paired with 
only one member of {1, 2, 3}. Figure 16.5c does not 
display a function. In this case one member of {A, 
B, C} is paired with two different members of {1, 2, 
3}. This violates the deﬁ nition of a function, where

Magic Math Box
Level: Grades 2– 5
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students generate a rule to explain the relation be-
tween two numbers.
Materials: Index cards
•  Draw a magic math box on an overhead or on the board.
•  Tell the students that the box changes any numbers that 
are written inside it.
•  Demonstrate by writing 2 inside 
the box (input) and 3 outside 
the box (output).
•  Ask children about a rule for 
these numbers. They might 
•  guess  1,  2,  1, and other possible rules. Have them 
suggest new input numbers; write the output number for 
each input number until they agree on a rule that works 
for all the examples.
•  Write another number inside the box, and ask students to 
guess the result using the new rule. If the rule is  1 and 
the inside number is 5, the outside number is 5  1  6.
•  Have students explain the rule and then take turns making 
up new rules, such as n  2, n  1, 3n  1, and so forth.
Extension
•  Have students make their own set of magic math cards. 
Fold 3  5 note cards in half. Write the input number 
on the outside of the card, and the output number on 
the inside. Make several more cards using the same rule. 
Fold back the cards with a rubber band and put them in 
a learning center. Children unfold the cards one at a time 
and guess the rule. Each new card can conﬁ rm or reject 
the rule.

there is a one-to-one pairing between the given set 
and the resulting set.
Formal deﬁ nitions of functions are not very ben-
eﬁ cial to elementary students. Students in elemen-
tary and middle school can best learn about func-
tions by exploring function relationships, solving 
function problems, and applying functions to real-
life situations as described here.
Younger 
children 
can begin to work with 
functions using straight-
forward 
relationships 
between the input and 
output values (called do-
main and range). Activi-
ties involving functions 
can use the context of a 
function machine to help children understand func-
tions. For example, younger children can be asked 
about horses on a farm. If there is one horse (input), 
how many eyes does it have (output)? What if there 
are two horses? three? four? Suppose that there are 
10 horses. Children reason that there are twice as 
many eyes as horses. It may not be beneﬁ cial to in-
troduce notation to represent the number of eyes 
in the primary grades, but by grade 4 the notation 
2  h can be appropriate. For younger children a 
t-chart such as that used in Activity 16.9 is helpful.
A classroom function machine can be made from 
a large cardboard box (one large enough to hold an 
adult) with two slots cut 
into it, one marked “input” 
and one marked “output” 
(Figure 16.6). Instead of 
using numbers for input 
values, 
drawings 
can 
help children understand 
the basics of a function 
machine. For example, 
when a child puts a piece 
of paper with a single tri-
angle into the input slot, 
the adult in the box slides 
a piece of paper with two 
triangles out of the output 
slot. When a child inputs a piece of paper with two 
triangles, the adult in the box slides a piece with 
three triangles out of the output slot, and so forth. 
If an adult aide is not available to “operate” the ma-
chine, perhaps an older child from an upper grade 
can provide the output results. Children will quickly 
catch on to the rules that the “machine” is using. 
Figure 16.6 Function box 
with input and output
slots
Input
Output

Then pairs of children can replace the adult aide 
and produce output data from inside the box.
Activity 16.13 uses a drawing of a function ma-
chine to explore functions with children.
When younger students have a proper introduc-
tion to unknown quantities through regular explo-
rations with number sentences and then equations, 
they develop a solid understanding of the role of a 
variable and its value in problem solving. Equally 
important is the balance aspect of equations. Chil-
dren who understand that the equal sign indicates 
that two parts of an equation are equal, or balanced, 
will not fall into the common trap of rote symbol 
manipulation to solve equations with no recognition 
of the balance aspect of equations.
Extending Algebraic Thinking
Older children move beyond intuitive activities in 
algebraic reasoning to more abstract experiences. 
They begin to explore algebraic relationships using 
equations and functions that they represent on pa-
per. The NCTM algebra standards for older children 
follow.
NCTM Algebra Standard
Algebra instructional programs from prekindergarten 
through grade 12 should enable all students to:
Understand patterns, relations, and functions
Grades 3– 5 Expectations:
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  describe, extend, and make generalizations about geo-
metric and numeric patterns;
•  represent and analyze patterns and functions, using 
words, tables, and graphs.
Grades 6– 8 Expectations:
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  represent, analyze, and generalize a variety of patterns 
with tables, graphs, words, and, when possible, symbolic 
rules;
•  relate and compare different forms of representation for 
a relationship;
•  identify functions as linear or nonlinear and contrast their 
properties from tables, graphs, or equations.
Represent and analyze mathematical situations and 
structures using algebraic symbols
Grades 3– 5 Expectations:
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  identify such properties as commutativity, associativity, 
and distributivity and use them to compute with whole 
numbers;
•  represent the idea of a variable as an unknown quantity 
using a letter or a symbol;
•  express mathematical relationships using equations.
Grades 6– 8 Expectations:
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  develop an initial conceptual understanding of different 
uses of variables;
•  explore relationships between symbolic expressions and 
graphs of lines, paying particular attention to the mean-
ing of intercept and slope;
•  use symbolic algebra to represent situations and to 
solve problems, especially those that involve linear 
relationships;
•  recognize and generate equivalent forms for simple alge-
braic expressions and solve linear equations.
Use mathematical models to represent and under-
stand quantitative relationships
Grades 3– 5 Expectations:
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  model problem situations with objects and use repre-
sentations such as graphs, tables, and equations to draw 
conclusions.
Grades 6– 8 Expectations:
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  model and solve contextualized problems using various 
representations, such as graphs, tables, and equations.
Analyze change in various contexts
Grades 3– 5 Expectations:
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  investigate how a change in one variable relates to a 
change in a second variable;
•  identify and describe situations with constant or varying 
rates of change and compare them.
Grades 6– 8 Expectations:
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  use graphs to analyze the nature of changes in quantities 
in linear relationships.
Extending Understanding of Patterning
As older children develop their algebraic thinking, 
their study and analysis of patterns becomes more 
sophisticated, with more challenging patterns to 
analyze. They move from simply determining the 
next term in a pattern or from identifying a pattern 
(such as A-B, A-B, A-B, . . .) to using patterns to solve 
problems, much like the cricket chirp pattern. The 
pattern may be generalized to produce solutions to 
problems that would be difﬁ cult to solve otherwise. 
Activity 16.14 shows a problem that could be studied 
at two levels. Notice that at one level the challenge is 
to ﬁ nd a pattern and use it to determine the number 
of squares in the next ﬁ gure, a 5  5 grid. Students 
then verify their answer by counting all the squares 
on the grid. As an extension, students move beyond 
discerning the pattern and predicting the next term 
in the pattern. They generalize from the pattern to 
determine the number of squares in a 10  10 grid 
without having to determine the number of squares 
in all the smaller grids. Activity 16.15 examines a 
growing pattern. In this pattern each subsequent 
stage is a larger increase than the previous stage. In

How Many Squares? (Communication)
Level: Grades 5 and 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students count the squares in a diagram and record 
their counting to ﬁ nd a pattern and generalize a process.
Materials: None
•  Have students look at a 4  
4 diagram and count all the 
squares they can ﬁ nd. Re-
mind them that squares can 
come in different sizes.
•  As students complete their 
work, record their answers 
on the board, such as 16, 17, 
21, 28, 29, and 30.
•  Ask: “Which squares did you ﬁ nd ﬁ rst? Which were 
harder to ﬁ nd? How many squares did you ﬁ nd of each 
size?”
•  As individuals report their process and talk about the 
different-size squares, draw a t-chart showing the size of 
squares and the number (see t-chart). For each size, ask 
students to conﬁ rm the count until everyone is satisﬁ ed. 
When these counts are totaled, students should agree on 
30. Ask students if they see any patterns.

•  Ask: “What do you 
think the next number 
in the sequence will 
be?” Have students use 
the 5  5 diagram to 
check their conjecture.
Extension
•  Extend the thinking about patterns and representations 
of patterns by presenting a 10  10 square diagram. Ask: 
“How many squares total are there in a 10  10 square?”
•  Begin by reviewing the data for 5  5.

•  Again, encourage discussion of patterns. At some point, 
students should realize that, rather than counting all 
the squares, they can simply add the square numbers 
1  4  9  16    100.
•  Finally, say: “Let me show you a 
symbol for summing numbers.” 
Introduce  as a summation symbol 
that can be used any time the sum 
of a series of numbers is to be 
determined.
•  Discuss the idea of a general solu-
tion and a concise symbolization 
result from extending the lesson 
•  to a situation in which physical counting is too difﬁ cult 
and cumbersome.
Activity 16.16 older students ﬁ nd a growing pattern 
and then use it to develop a generalized relationship 
between the number of sides in a polygon and the 
number of diagonals in the polygon.

Older students can also discern patterns in more 
complex series of numbers. The following series of 
numbers have a pattern that will allow students to 
predict the next term and perhaps determine an ex-
pression for determining the number in any term of 
the pattern:

tern shows the factors of 5. Each term is a factor of

How Many Diagonals? (Connections)
Level: Grades 5 and 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students use patterns to determine the number of 
diagonals in dodecagons by observing a pattern.
•  Draw a pentagon on the board. Ask students to describe 
a diagonal and then ask for a volunteer to draw a diago-
nal in the pentagon.
•  Using the same vertex, ask for volunteers to draw another 
diagonal from that vertex.
•  Have students draw their own pentagon and then draw 
and count all possible diagonals.
•  Once students can correctly draw and count the diagonals 
in a pentagon (there are ﬁ ve), challenge them to predict 
the number of diagonals in a dodecagon by looking for a 
pattern to the number of diagonals in polygons.
•  Students should explore the number of diagonals in vari-
ous polygons by drawing each polygon and all possible 
diagonals.
•  Students should record their data for polygons up to eight 
sides in a table, as shown here.

•  The pattern here shows that the change in the number 
of diagonals is not constant. The change in the number 
of diagonals increases by 1 for each successive polygon. 
By continuing his pattern, students can determine that a 
dodecagon has 54 diagonals.

Building Houses
Level: Grade 3– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students model a row of houses and ﬁ nd a rule for the 
relationship.
Materials: Pattern blocks
•  Ask students to make a house using a square and a tri-
angle. Then have them make a row of houses. The houses 
are attached to one another, as shown.
•  Ask students how many outside edges, including the roof, 
one house has. (Answer: 5.) Have them count the number 
of outside edges for two houses, three houses, and four 
houses.
•  Have students make a table or t-chart to record the 
number of houses and the number of outside edges. 
Ask if they see a pattern. (Answer: The number of edges 
increases by 3 for each house.)

•  Ask students to predict the number of edges for 5, 6, 7, 8, 
9, and 10 houses.
•  Ask if they can think of a rule for the number of houses 
and the number of edges. (Answer: The number of edges 
is the number of houses times 3, plus 2.)
•  Ask the students to explain how the rule applies to the 
ﬁ rst house (Answer: three sides on the house and two 
edges on the roof) and to the added houses (Answer: 
add two sides and adjoin one side, add two edges for the 
roof).
•  Extensions: Depending on the experience and under-
standing of the students, the relationship can be graphed 
and written as a formula: edges  3  houses  2, or 
later, y  3x  2.

5 and the term in position 6 is 5  6. The term in 
position 9 is 5  9, and the term in the nth position is 
5n. When students are able to represent a pattern in 
this way, they are beginning to use one of the most 
powerful tools of algebra, generalizing a relation-
ship from data taken from their observations.
Some students enjoy patterns that involve a se-
ries of items that are neither numbers nor alphabet 
letters. In the patterns shown here the letters in the 

Calendar pages are another source of patterns, 
some of which we describe here. Students can ver-
ify that any block of four dates will have the same 
sum along both diagonals. Every date is 7 less than 
the date directly below it. Activity 16.17 uses the cal-
endar as the focus for patterns.
Activity 16.18 is an assessment activity where 
students determine the next two terms of patterns. 
Activity 16.19 builds on Activity 16.18 by asking stu-
dents to examine two series and graph them.
Students can also use graphing to ﬁ nd the solu-
tion to a problem that is revealed by a pattern of 
data. In the following problem students can ﬁ nd the 
answer by graphing the data on a coordinate grid:
•  An intake system ﬁ lls a silo with grain. The time 
needed to ﬁ ll the silo to various depths is given in 
the data table. How long will it take to ﬁ ll the silo 
to a depth of 31 feet?

This problem could be solved by ﬁ lling in all the 
missing data in the table to ﬁ nd the number of min-
utes for 31 feet. Students could also develop an ex-
pression for the relationship between the number of 
hours (h) and the depth of grain (d): d  3h  2. For 
this problem it may be easier to graph the data. Cer-
tainly it would be easier to graph using a graphing 
calculator, but we will assume that students will do 
their graphing using graph paper. Figure 16.8 shows 
the graph of this problem. The data are plotted on the 
coordinate grid, and the line joining the data points

Patterns with items that are neither numerical nor alphabeti-
cal could include days or months in a foreign language. For 
example, students from Haiti would be able to identify the 
next term in dimanche, lundi, mardi, mercredi, . . . . Repeat-
ing designs from clothing or decorative artwork could be 
examined for repeating patterns.

•  Ask students to write their number sentences for three 
consecutive dates on index cards, and post them on the 
bulletin board.
•  After students have posted several examples, ask if 
anyone has found a pattern. Students should see that 
the sum of three consecutive numbers is the same as the 
middle number added three times.

•  Ask why the equation is true. (Answer: The ﬁ rst number is 
1 less than the middle, and the last number is 1 more, so 
they add to 0.)

•  Ask if they see a pattern, and why they think this pattern 
works. What is the number rule to express this pattern?
•  Have students answer questions such as the following: 
If Friday is March 6, what is the date two Fridays later? If 
Sunday is April 13, what date is the following Sunday? the 
following Monday? the following Saturday?

•  Students should also explain how they determined the

•  Students should produce two patterns of their own that 
will be given to the class to solve at a later time.
The numerical patterns given here show either the same 
additive difference between terms (e.g., 4, 8, 12, 16, 
which has a difference of 4 between terms) or a varying 
difference between terms (e.g., 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21). When 
these two series are graphed, the difference between 
them becomes apparent. The data for each series can be 
recorded in t-charts and then graphed.

The data of the ﬁ rst series form a line. They are in a linear 
relationship that can be represented as N  4 or y  x

straight line. This series forms a curve. Activity 16.19 asks 
students to examine these two series and to graph them.

is extended. The line will eventually pass through 
the point where the depth is 20. That point has a 
value of 58. Thus, ﬁ lling a silo to a depth of 20 feet 
requires 58 minutes. Activity 16.20 asks students to 
use a graph to solve a problem involving the depth 
of a swimming pool.
Extending Understanding 
of Equations
Students in upper elementary school and middle 
school continue to develop their understanding of 
equations by representing relationships in problems 
with equations and then solving those problems. 
The balance aspect of equations for students is still 
important so that they do not lose this underlying 
idea in solving equations. Some students focus so 
much on manipulating equations to solve for x that 
they disregard the idea of equality in equations. Ac-
tivities 16.21 and 16.22 extend this balance aspect of 
equations.
Experiences with the balance aspect of equa-
tions help students to observe equations as consist-
ing of two equal parts on each side of the equal sign. 
They understand the need to perform identical op-
erations to both sides of an equation to maintain the 
balance. One approach to solving equations makes 
use of the idea of undoing an equation by perform-
ing the same procedure to both sides. Consider the 
following equation:

The student covers the ﬁ rst part of the equation that 
needs undoing.

Algebra tiles are a common manipulative with 
many uses in the algebra curriculum. The square 
represents x2, the long piece represents x, and the

equations using the tiles. For example, the equation 
2x  4  8 is shown here with algebra tiles.

Students can move the tiles to replicate solving the 
problem, similar to how they can represent and 
solve equations using a balance scale. Algebra 
tiles are also used in higher grade levels to repre-
sent multiplying binomials and factoring quadratic 
equations.
Extending the Meaning 
of Functions
The role of function with older students grows in im-
portance, because students at this level begin to use 
functions to make sense of many relationships both 
in and out of school. The basic concept of function 
that these students learned in earlier grades has not

tions and the application of functions to an expand-
ing variety of situations.
As stated earlier in this chapter, the relationship 
between two sets of numbers is a function; each 
item in one set matches, or maps onto, an item in 
the other set. A rate table is often used to show the 
relationship between two sets of numbers.
•  Ms. Sund wants to increase the sale of CDs in her 
music store. She decides to offer an incentive by 
reducing the price of CDs by $1 for each addi-
tional CD purchased. What advice would you give 
her about this plan?
The cost of CDs at the regular price is shown in one 
rate table (Figure 16.9a), and the cost of CDs on sale 
is shown in a different rate table (Figure 16.9b). By 
graphing the data (Figure 16.9c), students can com-
pare the cost of CDs at the regular price and at the 
sale price and then predict, calculate, and graph the 
cost of buying 6, 7, and 8 CDs. Extending the pattern

may yield some surprising results and advice for the 
record shop owner about her sale plans. (As a cus-
tomer purchases more CDs, the total price begins to 
decrease!) The price of CDs is a function of the num-
ber of CDs. The relationship between the number 
of CDs and the price of regularly priced CDs shows 
a constantly increasing function. The rate table for 
the sale CDs shows a changing relation between 
number and price. Tables and graphs make relation-
ships, changes, and trends more apparent so that 
students can ﬁ nd and interpret patterns.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving

Another way to explore functions is to focus on 
the functions themselves. Activity 16.23 uses a two-
step function machine, Activity 16.24 applies a clock 
as the starting point for examining modular arithme-
tic functions, and Activity 16.25 draws on a function 
machine found on the Internet. In modular or clock 
arithmetic the base of the number system is the 
number of digits on the clock. Our number system 
is a base-10 number system and can be represented 
on a clock with 10 digits. Consider a base-12 system, 
represented on a clock with 12 digits. The problem 
8  6  ? can be represented by ﬁ rst moving the 
clock hand to 8. Then advancing the hand of the 
clock 6 more hours. The hand would make a com-
plete revolution and then begin another turn around 
the dial. In this case the hand ends up pointing to 2.

A simple clock is a four-hour clock with 0, 1, 2, 
and 3 for digits. What is the sum of 3  2 on this 
clock? First the hand moves to 3, and then advances 
two more hours. It would end up moving to 1. Thus 
on this clock 3  2  1. Subtraction and multiplica-
tion might also be explored with this clock.

Take-Home Activities
Many teachers have prepared manipulative kits for 
children to take home. Informal activities such as 
games and puzzles allow parents and children to 
work together in a different way than paper-and-
pencil homework. Here are two letters and direc-
tions for a primary kit and an intermediate kit that 
highlight patterning.
Primary Kit
Dear Parent,
We have been studying patterns. In the plastic bag, you will ﬁ nd blocks that 
join together. The blocks can be used to show many patterns. Here is one 
example. Your child should be able to make this pattern, read “red-blue, red-
blue,” and add blocks that continue the pattern.
With the blocks, you can make other patterns for your child to work with. 
Make a record of the patterns you create together.
Your child may also ﬁ nd other examples of patterns around the house. Pat-
terns occur in music when sequences of notes are repeated and in art when 
colors or designs are repeated. Your child will ﬁ nd patterns in clothing with 
stripes or plaid designs. He or she will also ﬁ nd patterns in many daily rou-
tines, such as getting ready for bed, cleaning up after a meal, or shopping 
for groceries. It is also important for your child to notice when a pattern is 
changed, disrupted, or incomplete.
Looking for patterns helps children recognize how important and useful pat-
terns are to us in everyday life.
Thank you for your help.

Dear Parents,
We have been learning about patterns this year. Patterns are important think-
ing skills in mathematics. This pattern puzzle can be completed with tiles or 
blocks or by coloring.
It begins with one tile on the grid paper. The next size square has 4 tiles in it 
and needs 3 more tiles. The next square has 9 tiles and takes 5 more tiles to 
complete. We have worked this far in class. When each new square is made, 
the number of tiles needed follows a pattern based on the length of the side 
of the squares.
Add tiles to ﬁ nish the squares on the grid. Your student can extend the pattern 
to 10  10 and record results in the table. What patterns were found?
Thank you for your assistance.

Summary
When NCTM included algebra as one of the content stan-
dards for grades K– 12, they made a major realignment 
in the curriculum for elementary school. They called for 
elementary school students to begin work in algebra. But 
algebra in elementary school was not to be an abstract 
manipulation of x and y. Instead, algebra was a natural 
extension of problem solving with numbers, geometry, 
measurement, and data collection. In these activities 
students encounter the algebraic thinking and themes 
related to pattern, variables, equality, relations and func-
tion, representation, and change.
Patterns are a central theme of algebraic understand-
ing, and children should see many different types of pat-
terns, ranging from patterns with numbers and letters to 
patterns using sounds, objects, and real-world data. One 
goal of exploring patterns is to use them to solve real-life 
problems. It is important that children have many oppor-
tunities to engage in algebraic reasoning with manipula-
tives, such as pan balances, so that they have concrete 
experiences that provide a solid understanding of the 
balance aspect of equations. Finally, students should 
have many opportunities to work with functions, using 
real data and then generalizing to algebraic expressions 
to describe the functions.
Study Questions and Activities

Burns, Marilyn. (1997). Spaghetti and meatballs for all. 
New York: Scholastic. (Grades K– 3)
In the story Spaghetti and Meatballs for All, Mrs. Comfort 
invites 32 people to a family reunion at her house. She 
decides to seat them at adjoining tables. How many 
tables does she need? Students could make a table to 
keep track of the data in the story and ﬁ nd the pattern 
to the number of tables and number of people who 
can sit at them. Students could also use sticky notes for 
tables and rearrange them as the story requires.

The Rajah’s Rice presents the tale of Chandra, who 
cures the Rajah’s elephants. He is willing to reward her 
with gold and jewels, but she asks only for some grains 
of rice on a chessboard. Her request of one grain on the 
ﬁ rst square, 2 on the second, 4 on the third, and so forth 
results in quite a surprise for the Rajah. Students can 
make a table to compute the number of grains on the 
ﬁ rst 10 squares.

After students discern the pattern for the number of 
grains of rice, ask them to make an estimate of the total 
number of grains on square 25, on square 50, and on 
square 64. After each estimate, allow students to use 
a calculator to compute the number of grains of rice. 
Conclude by asking students to explain why the Rajah 
could not fulﬁ ll Chandra’s request.

At http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/mathsﬁ le/ there is an al-

students match equation solutions in a grid of squares. 
When a correct pair is matched, the grid reveals two 
squares of a picture. The goal is to reveal the entire pic-
ture. Students can try to solve the equations mentally or 
use pencil and paper. There are three levels of difﬁ culty 
to the equations, ranging from simple one-step equa-
tions to two-step equations to equations that require 
using the distributive law to solve. The amusing sound 
effects can be turned off for those students who ﬁ nd 
them distracting.

Developing 
Geometric 
Concepts 
and Systems
or many years geometry instruction was limited to naming 
shapes and measuring angles. Today, geometry plays a 
central role in elementary school mathematics. Geo-
metric systems and spatial sense are partnered with 
number systems and numerical thinking as foundations 
for elementary and higher mathematics. Geometry also has many practical 
applications. Many everyday activities require spatial sense to provide an 
orientation with surroundings, whether ﬁ nding a missing set of keys, making 
a trip to the grocery store, or walking from one room to another.
 
People use their spatial sense to arrange furniture, pack luggage, and 
park cars. They also use geometric relationships to measure distances and 
estimate length and area. Geometric and visual thinking are essential in art, 
architecture, design, graphics, animation, and dozens of other vocational 
and recreational settings.
 
Rich experiences in geometry develop problem-solving and reasoning 
skills and connect with many other topics in mathematics and with the real 
world.

elementary and intermediate school curriculum

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Geometry provides strong connections to our world. 
Both practical and aesthetic aspects of geometry 
are found in art and architecture, space explora-
tion, home planning, and clothing and automobile 
design. Such topics interest students and can be 
used to develop children’s geometry knowledge 
and skills, spatial sense, and problem-solving abili-
ties. Materials and activities in geometry require 
that children describe geometric forms, search for 
patterns, organize data, build and interpret models, 
make conjectures, and draw conclusions.
NCTM identiﬁ ed geometry as one of the ﬁ ve con-
tent strands in mathematics education. The speciﬁ c 
recommendations for geometry at the Pre-K– 2 level 
are shown here.

social studies have a spatial quality. Algebra, trigo-
nometry, calculus, and topics in higher mathemat-
ics also require spatial thinking.
Spatial sense, also called spatial perception or 
spatial visualization, helps students understand the 
relationship between objects and their location in a 
three-dimensional world. It also helps them to orient 
themselves in their three-dimensional world. Spatial 
sense is the ability to perceive objects in relation to 
one another and to oneself, the ability to mentally 
change the orientation of an object in relation to 
other objects or to oneself.
Spatial sense is an intuitive feel for one’s 
surroundings and the objects in them. To 
develop spatial sense, children must have 
many experiences that focus on geometric 
relationships; the direction, orientation, and 
perspectives of objects in space; the relative 
shapes and sizes of ﬁ gures and objects; and 
how a change in shape relates to a change in 
size (National Council of Teachers of Math-
ematics, 1989, p. 49).
One of the eight multi-
ple intelligences proposed 
by Howard Gardner (1982) 
is the spatial ability that all 
people have and that can 
be 
developed 
through 
experience. In fact, many 
great scientists, mathema-
ticians, and inventors—in-
cluding Einstein—report 
that they saw how things 
worked before they were 
able to explain or demon-
strate their discoveries.
Del Grande and Mor-
row (1989, pp. 1– 3) identi-
ﬁ ed seven skills that con-
tribute to spatial sense:
1. Eye-motor coordination is the ability to coordi-
nate the eye with other parts of the body in vari-
ous activities.
2. Figure-ground perception is the visual act of iden-
tifying a ﬁ gure against a complex background.
3. Perceptual constancy is the ability to recognize 
ﬁ gures or objects in space, regardless of size, 
position, or orientation.
4. Position-in-space perception is the ability to relate 
an object in space to oneself.
5. Perception of spatial relationships is the ability to 
see two or more objects in relation to oneself or 
in relation to each other.
6. Visual discrimination is the ability to distinguish 
the similarities and differences between or 
among objects.
7. Visual memory is the ability to recall objects no 
longer in view.
Through work with 
two- 
and 
three-dimen-
sional objects, children 
develop 
their 
spatial 
sense. The activities in this 
section are all designed 
to enhance younger stu-
dents’ spatial visualiza-
tion skills, although older 
students may also beneﬁ t 
from these experiences. Activity 17.1 focuses on the 
spatial perception children use to orient themselves 
in a three-dimensional world.
When adults read storybooks to young chil-
dren, they expect children to readily interpret two-
dimensional drawings as representative of three-
dimensional objects. When children see a picture of 
a kite or a dog in a storybook, they realize that these 
objects in a book with length and width represent 
length, width, and depth. Activity 17.2 helps students 
focus attention on the careful translation of two-
dimensional sketches to three-dimensional shapes. 
The activity can be made more challenging for older 
children by using more complex diagrams and ask-
ing students to determine the number of blocks in a 
block structure without actually building it. An ex-
tension of the activity might be to ask students to 
design and draw their own block structures using 
isometric dot paper (see Black-Line Master 17.1 and 
page 392).
For children in the early grades Activity 17.3 con-
centrates on a different spatial sense skill: perceiv-
ing individual and overlapping shapes in a compos-
ite ﬁ gure. Activity 17.4 takes advantage of children’s 
love of solving mazes. In this interactive electronic 
activity, found on the Internet, children plot a path 
through a maze by giving careful directions to a lost 
ladybug. Such an activity helps younger children 

focus on directions and terminology, such as turn, 
left, and right.
Several of the companion website activities fos-
ter spatial sense. The activity “Matching Outlines” 
challenges children to match a three-dimensional 
object with its outline. The activity “Mirror Partners” 
asks students to imitate the motions of a face-to-face 
partner.
What Teachers Need to Know 
About Teaching Geometry
Research following the van Hieles’s studies, dis-
cussed later, has supported the general framework 
of the levels of geometry thinking. There are several 
implications for teachers. It is critical that activities 
match the van Hiele levels of students. If students are 
reasoning at a lower level than the level of the activi-
ties, the result will be that students will revert to rote 
memorization in an attempt to complete tasks.
Spatial sense is not an innate ability and must be 
developed. Many children will have developed their 
spatial sense with out-of-school activities. For those 
who have not, their teacher must help to develop 
their spatial sense by using activities that expand 
and enhance spatial abilities.
Geometry is part of everything humans do. To 
describe and understand the two- and three-dimen-
sional world we live in, mathematicians have devel-
oped several different geometric systems. The need

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Research for the Classroom
•
Recent research and children’s performances on national 
and international tests support the claim that there is no 
real gender advantage as far as mathematics is concerned. 
The myth that “math is for boys and English is for girls” is 
simply not sustained by any hard evidence. However, there 
is one mathematics area in which research shows that boys 
have an advantage over girls: spatial sense. Young boys 
outscore young girls in several areas of spatial sense, in-
cluding mazes, mental rotations, block designs, and block 
building (Levine et al., 1999). Mental rotation is particularly 
difﬁ cult for young girls, with only 17% of young girls per-
forming at the average level of the boys (Linn & Petersen, 
1986). This gap in mental rotation ability is all the more im-
portant because this ability is linked to SAT scores, with a 
higher correlation than either mathematics self-conﬁ dence 
or mathematics anxiety (Casey et al., 1997).
 
Earlier research has demonstrated that spatial visualiza-
tion skills are not established at birth but can be learned 
and enhanced through a variety of experiences (see 
Activity 17.1). In view of this gender difference in spatial vi-
sualization skills, teachers need to be sure to include many 
spatial sense activities in the early years. Emerging research 
suggests that girls can catch up to boys in the early grades 
when they have ample opportunities to develop and 
extend their early spatial sense (Casey et al., 2004). Thus, 
in response to these research ﬁ ndings, teachers will need 
to explicitly help students, both boys and girls, to develop 
their spatial sense.
 
All students have an innate spatial sense, but it is im-
portant to remember that students enter school with dif-
ferent spatial sense abilities. Early experiences, before and 
outside school, help awaken and begin the spatial sense 
of some children. Other children may not have access to 
comparable early exposure. Children who have played 
with jigsaw puzzles, constructed Lego buildings, and built 
sand castles may have enhanced their natural spatial sense. 
Classroom teachers must allow for these differences and 
provide activities for students that will extend and en -
hance their students’ spatial sense, regardless of their 
grade level.

ACTIVITY 17.2
 
How Many Blocks?
Level: Grades 1– 6
Setting: Small groups or individual
Objective: Students build three-dimensional structures from two-
dimensional drawings.
Materials: Inch or centimeter cubes, activity sheets
•  Students use cubes to build three-dimensional structures 
drawn on their activity sheets.
•  Circulate as students are building. Ask if there are blocks 
in their building that they cannot see in the drawing
•  Have students record in a table how many blocks are 
needed to build each structure.
•  Question whether a given drawing can be built with a dif-
ferent number of blocks.
Variation
•  Older children can work with more complex buildings and 
might be challenged to determine the number of blocks 
by observation, without building the structures.
ACTIVITY 17.1
 
Move Around the Solid City
Level: Grades K– 4
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students identify the order of viewing positions around 
a mock town.
Materials: Solid ﬁ gures such as View Thru Solids, simple sketches 
of Solid City from several viewpoints
•  Organize students into groups of four. Number each 
group.
•  Have each group member sit on one side of a table.
•  Put several solids such as a cube, pyramid, cone, or other 
relatively simple three-dimensional shapes in the center of 
the table. Tell the students these are part of Solid City. (A 
clear plastic model is preferred because students can see 
through it to lines and points not facing them.) Caution 
the students not to move the solids once they have been 
put before them.
•  Each group is given a set of Solid City sketches. Their task 
is to determine where to stand around the table to see 
the same view that is depicted in each sketch.
•  Once students in a group have determined each view-
point, they should put the sketches in the order of views 
a student would see as the student walked clockwise 
around the table.
•  Have students explain how they decided on the order of 
the sketches.
Extension for Older Students
•  Each student in a group stands in a different position 
around the table. Each student is to sketch the view of 
the solids from her or his perspective. Some children may 
sketch edges of the solids that are hidden from view. They 
can use solid lines for edges facing the drawer and broken 
lines for those that are away from the drawer.
•  The four sketches are put into a pile and then exchanged 
with another group.
•  Students who receive drawings from the other group have 
to put them in order according to the views a student 
would see if he or she walked around Solid City.
•  Ask students to label their drawings by naming the shape 
or shapes they see from each perspective.
•  Have students rearrange their town, make new sketches, 
and exchange them with another group.
•  After several exchanges, ask students how they decided 
to organize the sketches.
•  Add a multicultural dimension to the activity by asking 
students what familiar building or structure each of the 
shapes calls to mind.
Extension
Sunburst has developed a software program, Building 
Perspective, that provides experiences for children to 
analyze, design, and build block structures.

ACTIVITY 17.3
 
Embedded Triangles
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students search for and record triangles in a composite 
ﬁ gure.
Materials: Diagrams of a composite ﬁ gure on a sheet of paper, 
crayons or colored pencils
•  Display the composite ﬁ gure to students.
•  Ask students to describe the ﬁ gure to classmates.
•  If students do not suggest that the ﬁ gure is composed of 
several triangles, probe for that insight as students relate 
their descriptions.
•  For younger students, pass out several copies of the 
composite ﬁ gure and ask students to color the various 
triangles with different colors. For example, on one sheet 
students could color the six triangles a, b, c, d, e, and 
f. On another sheet they might color triangle abc and 
triangle def.
•  For older students, ask them to label all the triangles they 
can see. One method of labeling is to label each vertex of 
the ﬁ gure and use three vertex points to designate each 
triangle.
•  Another method is to label each area of the ﬁ gure with a 
letter or number and then designate the triangles by using 
the composite areas. In the ﬁ gure below, labeled by areas, 
the triangles are:
a, b, c, d, e, f
ab, bc, de, ef, be, cf

Ladybug Maze (Internet Activity)
Level: Grades K– 4
Setting: Pairs of students or individual
Objective: Students plan a route for a ladybug through a maze 
using an activity on the Internet.
Materials: Internet access
•  Go to http://my.nctm.org/standards/document/eexamples/
index.htm. Follow the link to Ladybug Maze.
•  Help students understand the directions for the applet. 
Students use the applet to plan a path and then engage 
the ladybug to follow the path they have designed.
•  When students have compiled the directions for the path, 
ask them to describe how the ladybug will move when it 
follows a speciﬁ c command in the path plan.
•  When students create a path for the ladybug through the 
maze, have them print out the maze with and without the 
path.
•  Have them give the unmarked maze to another pair of 
students and then describe their successful path to 
them.
•  The students try to trace out the successful path following 
the directions they are given.

to make distinctions among these systems in elemen-
tary school is not great, but children learn basic as-
pects of at least four different geometric systems:
•  Topological geometry
•  Euclidean geometry
•  Coordinate geometry
•  Transformational geometry
Although the geometric systems are interrelated, 
each system uses a slightly different set of rules and 
vocabulary. Topological geometry describes where 
objects are located in relation to each other. A child’s 
ﬁ rst geometric experiences are topological, accord-
ing to Piaget. A child views everything in relation 
to his or her own location or personal perspective. 
By moving around and locating things in their en-
vironment, children develop a mental understand-
ing and an extensive vocabulary for objects in their 
space—far and near, above and below, before and 
behind, ﬁ rst and last.
Euclidean geometry, the geometry learned ex-
clusively by most students in high school, is the 
geometry of shapes and objects in two- and three-
dimensional space. In Euclidean geometry students 
learn the characteristics of objects: points and lines, 
circles and spheres, triangles and pyramids, squares 
and cubes, rectangles and prisms, and the many 
other ﬂ at shapes and solid ﬁ gures. These character-
istics and the relationships between them are orga-
nized into simple rule systems and formulas.
Coordinate geometry imposes a grid system 
on two- or three-dimensional space that has many 
simple and complex uses. The grid system on a city 
map shows that a particular building can be located 
in grid K-10. The grid system used by air trafﬁ c con-
trollers allows them to locate and give information 
to landing and departing aircraft.
Transformation geometry is sometimes called 
motion geometry, or the geometry of slides, ﬂ ips, 
and turns. As objects and shapes are moved or 
transformed by sliding, ﬂ ipping, or turning, they can 
be combined in many different ways. Frank Lloyd 
Wright, the great American architect, envisioned 
all buildings as combinations and rearrangements 
of the simple building blocks he played with as a 
child. Moving a ﬁ gure in transformation geometry 
may appear to change its appearance, but it will 
not change its fundamental characteristics. A kite 
can be seen in the sky, on the ground, from either 
side, sitting on its end or on its side, but it is still a 
kite, and none of its characteristics—length, width, 
shape—has changed.
Concepts and skills from each of these geometry 
systems are introduced informally in the elemen-
tary grades with engaging activities and materials. 
Because concepts from one system are related to 
concepts from another system, many activities over-
lap. Teachers do not need to differentiate among 
the four geometry systems for elementary students. 
However, you may ﬁ nd that different objectives in 
your curriculum emphasize different geometric sys-
tems. Figure 17.1 provides a graphic organizer for

expand the spatial visualization skills they acquired 
before entering school.
Progress from one [van Hiele] level to the 
next . . . is more dependent upon instruction 
than on age or biological maturation, and 
types of instructional experiences can affect 
progress (or lack of it). (Taylor et al., 1991, 
p. 9)
During the second stage (analysis), students be-
come more proﬁ cient in describing the attributes of 
two- and three-dimensional shapes. The language 
they use is a mixture of mathematical terminology 
and less precise nouns and adjectives. A triangle has 
three sides and three points, or corners. A sphere is 
a “ball” and is round all over—but a cone is round 
and ﬂ at on one end and “pointy” (or has a “round 
point”) on the other. A square has “straight” corners. 
Teachers accept children’s language but consistently 
use correct terminology in response:
Teacher: The ball is also called a sphere.
Teacher: All six faces of this cube are squares.
Teacher: The corners of the triangle are called 
angles.
Teacher: This is a 90-degree angle and is called a 
right angle.
Children learn to identify the unique characteristics 
of all plane and solid ﬁ gures through work with vari-
ous geometric situations and materials.
The third van Hiele stage (informal deduction) 
begins in the intermediate grades, as children clas-
sify and organize two- and three-dimensional ﬁ g-
ures according to their characteristics. A debate 
about whether a square is a rectangle or a rectangle 
is a square is valuable in clarifying the relationships 
between squares and rectangles. (A square is a spe-
cial rectangle because it has all the characteristics 
of a rectangle plus four congruent sides.) As they 
mature, children learn that all four-sided ﬁ gures are 
quadrilaterals despite different appearances. Quad-
rilaterals can be either regular (a square) or irregular 
(all other quadrilaterals). Children ﬁ nd that certain 
shapes ﬁ t side to side to make designs and that others 
do not. The questions and problems encountered in 
elementary school provide background for the later, 
more formal deductive study of geometry in middle 
and senior high school and beyond, which is done 
at the fourth and ﬁ fth van Hiele stages.
Euclidean geometry is named for Greek mathematician Euclid 
(ca. 300 B.C.E.). Euclid organized all the known geometry of 
his time into a series of assumed facts (postulates) and prov-
able statements (theorems).

Development of Geometric 
Concepts: Stages of Geometry 
Understanding
Pierre Marie van Hiele-Geldof and Dina van Hiele (a 
husband and wife who were Dutch middle school 
teachers and mathematicians) spent many years 
investigating and describing how children de-
velop their understanding of Euclidean geometry 
(Fuys & Tischler, 1988, p. 7). They concluded that 
individuals pass through ﬁ ve stages of geometric 
understanding:
Stage 0: Visualization—recognizing and naming the 
ﬁ gures
Stage 1: Analysis—describing the attributes of 
ﬁ gures
Stage 2: Informal deduction—classifying and gener-
alizing ﬁ gures by their attributes
Stage 3: Deduction—developing proofs using postu-
lates and deﬁ nitions
Stage 4: Rigor—working in various geometric 
systems
The ﬁ rst three stages occur during the elementary 
school years. By understanding children’s develop-
ment, teachers can design appropriate geometry 
activities.
The ﬁ rst stage (visualization) starts in a child’s 
early years and continues into the primary grades. 
Children recognize and label common plane ﬁ gures 
such as circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles. 
They recognize simple solids such as cubes, spheres, 
pyramids, and cones and name them with those la-
bels or with less formal names such as boxes and 
balls. At this stage children begin to develop and 
E

 
Chapter 17 Developing Geometric Concepts and Systems 
397
The fourth stage (deduction) and ﬁ fth stage 
(rigor) occur well after elementary school. A typi-
cal high school geometry course is designed to fully 
develop students’ deduction abilities with the pos-
tulate-theorem-proof of Euclidean geometry. The 
ﬁ nal stage of rigor describes the geometry thinking 
needed for graduate-level geometry courses.
With these stages of development in mind, 
teachers can plan activities for children’s study of 
geometry. The van Hieles found that every student 
must pass through each of the stages of geometric 
thinking in order. Thus a student who is operating 
at the visualization stage (Stage 0) will be unable 
to fully engage in an activity that stresses analysis 
(Stage 1) or informal deduction (Stage 2). Once a 
student is competent in visualization, then activities 
that stress the next van Hiele level can be offered. 
Because elementary students will focus on the ﬁ rst 
three stages, they are not expected to use deduc-
tive proofs as they deal with geometric concepts 
and forms. This does not mean that children can-
not engage in activities that involve some aspect 
of deduction. Children learn to play games such as 
Clue and Battleship, which require logical thinking. 
They can solve mystery stories that require deduc-
tive reasoning, such as the stories involving Amelia 
Bedelia or Encyclopedia Brown. Many geometry 
activities can involve discovery and conjecture as 
a means to develop children’s geometric thinking. 
By using task cards and activities designed for in-
dividual and group work, students can explore ge-
ometry concepts in an informal manner. Through 
manipulation of real objects and graphic represen-
tations, they name and describe geometric shapes 
and ﬁ gures and their characteristics, relationships, 
position, and properties.
Teaching and Learning About 
Topological Geometry
Topological geometry describes how objects in 
space relate to each other. A topological view does 
not require that ﬁ gures maintain a rigid or ﬁ xed 
shape, as in Euclidean geometry. Rather, a shape 
can be altered so that it assumes a new conﬁ gura-
tion, much as if it were drawn on a sheet of rubber 
that can be stretched in all directions. For example, 
a square can be stretched to the shape of a rect-
angle, an oval, or another simple closed ﬁ gure. An 
open ﬁ gure such as the letter C can be reshaped to 
look like the letter S. Certain characteristics, such as 
being a closed or open ﬁ gure, remain unchanged, 
even though the shape can take different forms.
Children’s perspective of the world, including 
their understanding of space, is idiocentric, or self-
centered. According to Piaget, young children do not 
view people and objects as stable and unchanging 
but see them in the topological sense. To children in 
the sensorimotor and preoperational stages, people 
and objects change as the position from which they 
are viewed changes. Therefore Piaget suggests that 
children’s early concepts of the spatial world are to-
pological (Piaget et al., 1960). Investigations of four 
topological relations—proximity and relative posi-
tion, separation, order, and enclosure—provide 
early spatial learning for preschool, kindergarten, 
and primary-grade students.
Proximity and Relative Position
Proximity refers to the relative location of objects 
in space—how near or far one object is from an-
other. Naturally, young children are interested in 
things close to them because they can touch and 
manipulate them. Things far out of their reach are 
usually of little interest, unless the child sees some-
thing that is eye-catching, such as a shiny part of a 
swinging mobile. Objects that are out of sight do not 
exist in the mind of a child in the early sensorimotor 
stage.
Gradually, children recognize that out-of-sight 
objects do exist, and they can identify the location 
of objects in space. Early experiences with spatial 
concepts and vocabulary such as near, far, close to, 
under, above, below, up, down, beside, between, next 
to, and so on come from children’s everyday experi-
ences and free-play activities.
Parents and teachers help develop children’s 
spatial understandings by using topological geom-
etry terms tied to real experiences drawn from mul-
ticultural settings:
•  Put the yellow sarong on top of the table.
•  Juanita is standing between Alexa and Candace.
•  The tower is going up, up, up. It is almost as tall as 
you are.
•  Bring the chair that is beside the computer into 
the listening center.
•  Walk close to the wall during the ﬁ re drill.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Working with collections of miniature toys and 
counting manipulatives also leads to language about 
location and proximity:
•  Which red car is farther from the green car?
•  Which bead is next to the blue bead?
Flannel-board shapes or magnetized objects can 
also be arranged so that teacher and students talk 
about their locations:
•  Emily, please move the blue car inside the red 
garage.
•  Which car is closest to the red airplane? farthest 
from it?
Spatial directions can be incorporated into simple 
games such as Simon Says, Mother May I, or I Spy. 
The teacher or students can identify objects in 
the room by describing their characteristics and 
position:
•  I spy something yellow on top of the coat closet.
•  I spy something under the desk nearest the wall.
•  I spy someone far from Sean and close to Paloma.
Children enjoy hiding objects to ﬁ nd when they play 
I Spy.
An obstacle course is another game for high-
lighting relative positions. Students move through a 
series of obstacles in the classroom or outdoors to 
demonstrate “over the chair,” “under the desk,” and 
“around the monkey bars.”
Children enjoy planning a path through a maze. 
They can describe the various turns made as they 
negotiate their escape path. Learning positional vo-
cabulary does not just build topological concepts; 
the same words are also important in language, read-
ing, and directions. An active approach to learning 
topological terms is one way to promote language 
development and understanding for students who 
are learning English as a second language.
Separation
Until children achieve an understanding of separa-
tion, they cannot clearly visualize an object as hav-
ing separate parts or a collection as being made up 
of separate objects. Children’s drawings, especially 
those of human ﬁ gures, demonstrate their poor un-
derstanding of separation. Early drawings are often 
egg-shaped, with odd lines for mouth, arms, and legs. 
The head may be an integral part of the body, rather 
than separate. Gradually, children differentiate body 
parts and add a distinct head, torso, and limbs. Fi-
nally, they draw details such as ﬁ ngers, toes, and all 
parts of the face and head in the proper places. This 
progression clearly demonstrates the idea of sepa-
ration, or differentiation, of whole and parts, which 
takes several years to develop. A teacher ﬁ nds vari-
ous opportunities to illustrate whole and parts:
•  The class is divided into two separate teams. 
Each team stands on one side of the room.
•  The library separates books for the primary 
grades from books for upper-grade children.
•  A fence separates cows from horses.
•  Some of the children drink orange juice, some 
drink milk, and some drink water.
•  Part of my allowance is for snacks, and part of my 
allowance is for a movie.
Classiﬁ cation activities also help children learn 
about parts and wholes. A set of toy animals can be 
divided into groups of dogs, cats, elephants, cows, 
horses, and monkeys. Recognizing sets and subsets 
is an important aspect of separation that leads to un-
derstanding of number concepts and common frac-
tions. Classiﬁ cation is also an important aspect of 
organizing an understanding of various geometric 
shapes and their relationships.
Order
A sequence of events has two orders: beginning to 
end and end to beginning, or forward and back-
ward. Developing a sense of reversibility, or oppo-
site order, is an important thinking skill. Young stu-
dents do not maintain the order of a set of events 
or objects. Patterning and sequence activities help 
establish a regular order of events and objects. The 
vocabulary for order is developed with the activi-
ties: ﬁ rst, last, middle, next to last, and so on.
Thinking forward is generally easier than think-
ing backward, so teachers need to engage students 
in a variety of activities that deal with reverse ac-
tions. Teacher-led activities direct attention to for-
ward and backward sequences. Children can form 
a tight circle on the ﬂ oor. At the teacher’s direction 
they enlarge the circle by moving backward until 
told to stop. After they reverse and tighten the circle, 
they can talk about what happened to the circle. Stu-
dents of many ages enjoy palindromic words and 
numbers. Palindromes are words and numbers that 

 
Chapter 17 Developing Geometric Concepts and Systems 
399
read the same forward as they do backward, such 
as 2002, 12321, MOM, DAD, BOB, OTTO, MADAM, 
and MADAM, I’M ADAM. Ask children what is spe-
cial about these words, numbers, and phrases, and 
challenge them to ﬁ nd other examples. Counting 
from 1 to 10, then from 10 to 1, is another example 
of reversibility. The countdown to a rocket takeoff 
is “10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, blast off!” Students also 
encounter reversibility of a sort when they see that 
subtraction can be considered the reverse of addi-
tion, and division the reverse of multiplication.
A learning center can be established with activi-
ties for dealing with order. Make four- or ﬁ ve-ﬁ gure 
patterns of rubber-stamped animals, birds, or ﬂ ow-
ers on a strip of paper. Then ask children to make 
the patterns in reverse. Teachers sometimes plan a 
“Backward Day,” in which the children do things 
backwards, and daily activities are reversed. At 
lunch they eat dessert ﬁ rst; they wear their shirts 
and blouses backwards; and they think of other 
ways to do things in reverse. The companion web-
site activity “Balls in a Tube” provides experiences 
for younger children as they build their understand-
ing of forward and backward sequences.
Enclosure
In simplest terms enclosure identiﬁ es locations in-
side, outside, in, out, and between. Similar to rela-
tive position, enclosure refers to (1) the position of 
one point between two others on a line, (2) a point 
within a closed curve on a plane, or (3) a point 
within a closed three-dimensional ﬁ gure in space 
(Figure 17.2).
Have children ﬁ nd examples of enclosure, or being 
between, in the room:
•  The ﬁ sh is inside the aquarium.
•  The bird is outside the cage.
•  The ﬂ ag is between the door and the chalk -
board.
•  The ﬁ le cabinet is between a bulletin board and a 
corner.
A block corner where children build corrals for 
horses and fenced lots for cars and trucks is an 
excellent place for children to explore enclosure 
within a plane ﬁ gure.
Demonstrating enclosure and separation in 
three dimensions can be done by placing a block 
inside a jar. When the lid is on, the block cannot be 
removed. The jar encloses the block. The jar sepa-
rates the block from the space outside the jar. The 
block is inside the jar. Have the children ﬁ nd other 
examples of items that are enclosed in boxes or jars 
inside the classroom. Containers with and without 
lids are used for storage. Use questions and com-
ments to stress the fact that a container does not 
enclose an object if there is no lid. Raise a question 
about things in a ﬁ le cabinet or closet:
•  Does the cabinet or closet enclose them?
•  Does a wastebasket enclose objects that are 
inside it?
For an activity that explores enclosures, see the 
companion website activity “Fences.” In the activity 
“Simple Closed Curves” on the companion website 
children explore various curves that they form using 
yarn, seeking to identify those yarn curves that are 
simple closed curves.
Topical geometry is strongly related to spatial 
perception. As children engage in activities that in-
volve topological geometry, they are also building 
spatial sense.

An understanding of enclosure on a line is im-
portant because children frequently encounter the 
idea of “between” in mathematics. Have ﬁ ve stu-
dents stand in a row facing the rest of the class; ask 
about their positions:
•  Who is between Kasheen and Thun?
•  How many children are between Amy and José?
•  Who is inside the block corner? outside the circle?

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Topological Mazes and Puzzles
There are many activities that involve topological 
types of challenges. Working maze puzzles and 
drawing ﬁ gures without lifting the pencil from the 
paper are topological activities that develop spatial 
sense and problem-solving skills. Figure 17.3 illus-
trates three topological puzzles that children enjoy. 
More examples can be found in the comics pages 
of newspapers or puzzle books in bookstores. Activ-
ity 17.5 provides a topological challenge for young 
children using alphabet letters.
Topology activities for older children can be pro-
vided by having them work with maps and mazes. 
For example, children might describe different 
routes from Los Angeles to New York on a map of the 
interstate highway system, using routes that never 
double back or cross over each other. Although the 
answers may vary greatly, topologically they are all 
continuous lines.
Teaching and Learning About 
Euclidean Geometry
Plane ﬁ gures are shapes that have two dimensions, 
such as squares, triangles, rectangles, circles, ellip-
ses, and other closed ﬁ gures. Space ﬁ gures have 
three dimensions. Examples are boxes and blocks, 
balls and world globes, cones, pyramids, and eggs. 
Young children typically learn about two-dimen-
sional shapes before they learn about some of the 
building blocks of geometry, such as points, lines, 
segments, and angles. They also begin to explore 
solid shapes before learning about characteristics of 
two-dimensional shapes, such as congruence, simi-
larity, and symmetry. The presentation of topics in 
this section follows this same order.
Geometry in Two Dimensions
Plane Figures. Plane ﬁ gures are common in chil-
dren’s environments. Classrooms have windows, 
doors, and other objects with square, rectangular, 
circular, and triangular shapes that children can 
locate and identify. They can also ﬁ nd shapes in 
pictures and on clothing designs. Children at the 
visualization stage of the van Hiele model of geom-
etry thinking may categorize all shapes with curved 
surfaces as circles. Similarly, they may consider 
many rectangles as squares. At higher van Hiele 
levels they will separate squares and rectangles and

•  Demonstrate to students that the letter C is a simple letter 
because it can be drawn without lifting the pencil off the

•  Ask students if they think the letter X is a simple letter. 
Then demonstrate that X cannot be drawn without lifting 
the pencil off the paper.
•  Pass out sets of letters to each pair of students, and ask 
them to make a list of simple letters.
•  Ask children if any of their names are “simple names” 
when printed, such as BOB.

MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
On a map, students might trace a journey between cities in 
their native country and shade provinces or states in their 
native country.
Another common topological puzzle is to color 
a state map of the United States. The challenge is 
to do this with the fewest number of colors so that 
no state touches another state with the same color. 
The teacher might challenge whether this can be ac-
complished with two colors, three colors, four col-
ors, ﬁ ve colors, six colors, or more. (No matter how 
complex a map, at most four colors are needed to 
color it.) Students may also wish to look at printed 
maps to see possible coloring solutions.

distinguish between circles and other shapes with 
curved lines.
Activity 17.6 presents an activity that can be ex-
plored at different levels, depending on the number 
of ﬁ gures used and the geometric thinking of the 
children. The task is to sort various random geomet-
ric shapes (see Black-Line Masters 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 
and 17.6) into different groups.
Many books for chil-
dren are excellent for 
identifying plane ﬁ gures 
and their characteristics. 
Books featuring geometry 
are noted in the Children’s 
Bookshelf at the end of 
this chapter. Students can 
take digital photographs 
of different shapes seen 
during a “shape” walk to 
display on a bulletin board 
or in a multimedia presen-
tation. Written material 
can accompany photos 
on a bulletin board. Oral 
descriptions can be de-
veloped for a multimedia 
presentation.
Students 
may 
also 
draw their shapes for a 
shape book. Children en-
joy making shape books or 
posters by cutting pictures 
from magazines. Sponges 
can be cut into geometric 
shapes, and students can 
use tempera paint to make 
designs with them. Large 
shapes can be outlined 
on the classroom ﬂ oor with masking tape or painted 
permanently on the playground or multipurpose 
room ﬂ oor so that children can walk around them. 
A shape scavenger hunt might be developed for the 
classroom or the entire school.
Experiences with physical models help children 
think about and visualize geometric ﬁ gures. Shape 
puzzles and shape templates are often found in 
early childhood classes. Templates can be bought 
commercially or cut from plywood, ﬁ berboard, 
cardboard, or recycled polystyrene meat trays. The 
templates and cut-out forms are useful for tracing, 
for puzzles, and for art projects. Activity 17.7 sug-
gests how templates help children understand the 
characteristics of common geometric ﬁ gures.
Many shapes convey meanings. In fact, identify-
ing the meaning of shapes in the environment is an 
important step in literacy development. An activ-
ity with trafﬁ c signs helps children connect shapes 
with their meaning. Common trafﬁ c signs, pictured 
in Figure 17.5, can be purchased or drawn and can 
be used in discussion and in acting-out exercises:
 
Chapter 17 Developing Geometric Concepts and Systems

MISCONCEPTION
Young children at the 
visualization level may 
recognize only equilat-
eral triangles as triangles 
because their experience 
in viewing and identifying 
triangles has consisted 
exclusively of equilateral 
triangles. In Figure 17.4 
you can see a ﬁ rst-grade 
student’s attempts to 
draw as many different 
triangles as possible. 
Despite their appear-
ances, all the triangles are 
equilateral triangles. Also 
note that all the triangles 
are oriented so that the 
bases are parallel to the 
bottom edge of the paper. 
Experiences with many 
types of triangles are 
needed so that children 
see that any shape with 
only three sides and three 
angles must be a triangle. 
The change from simply 
identifying shapes to 
recognizing attributes of 
shapes is the developmen-
tal progress suggested by 
the van Hieles in Stage 1 
(analysis).

(Answer: Look before you go.)

A geoboard is another learning aid for shape 
identiﬁ cation. Geoboards have square grid patterns 
of 25, 36, or more pegs, or pegs in the shape of a 
circle. Rubber bands are stretched around the pegs 
to form shapes and designs. Larger boards allow stu-
dents to construct several ﬁ gures at the same time. 
Geoboard pattern paper should be available so that 
children can record their geoboard ﬁ gures (see 
Black-Line Masters 17.7 and 17.8). Primary-grade stu-
dents gain an intuitive understanding of plane ﬁ g-
ures, points, and line segments as they make and 
talk about the geoboard ﬁ gures. Older students 
use geoboards to study different types of triangles, 
quadrilaterals, and other ﬁ gures and to learn about 
regular and irregular ﬁ gures, concave and convex 
ﬁ gures, congruence, similarity, and symmetry.
Children commonly study polygons along with 
circles and ellipses in elementary school. Polygons
are closed ﬁ gures with no curved lines. They are 
named for the number of sides in the polygon: trian-
gle (3), quadrilateral (4), pentagon (5), hexagon (6), 
ACTIVITY 17.6
 
Sorting Shapes (Communication)
Level: Grades 1– 5
Setting: Pairs of students
Objective: Students sort random geometric shapes into groups, 
using various schemes to differentiate between the shapes.
Materials: Geometric shapes cut from Black-Line Masters 17.2– 17.6
•  Before cutting out the shapes from the black-line masters, 
it is best to laminate them to increase their durability. 
Lamination will also make the pieces easier for younger 
children to manipulate.
•  For younger children, perhaps shapes 1– 9 or 1– 15 will be 
sufﬁ cient for the activity. Older children will be able to use 
all the shapes without becoming overwhelmed with so 
many ﬁ gures.
•  Pass out a set of shapes to each pair of students, and ask 
them to place the shapes into groups. They may use as 
many different groups as they wish, and not all shapes 
need to be included in the groups that students devise.
•  As students form groups with their shapes, ask them to 
write a sentence about the group and which shapes they 
put into that group.
•  Some students may be distracted by the numbers on the 
shapes or may group shapes using the numbers. To avoid 
any difﬁ culties with the numbers on the shapes, you 
might ask students to keep the shapes number side down.
•  Once students have sorted their shapes, ask for pairs of 
students to place their groups of shapes on the overhead 
projector and then challenge the rest of the class to deter-
mine their criteria for forming the group. Younger children 
will focus on number of sides, resemblance to familiar 
shapes, and the like. Older children may focus on parallel 
sides, angle measure, diagonals, and symmetry.
•  Children of all ages will use criteria that are not straight-
forward geometric relationships to sort their shapes, as 
the two student examples here demonstrate.

ACTIVITY 17.7
 
Feeling and Finding Shapes
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Small groups or individual
Objective: Students determine shapes by touch and identify by 
characteristics.
Materials: Geometric templates and shapes cut from them
•  Give the templates and cut-out shapes to students, and 
have them run their ﬁ ngers around the hole and along the 
edges of several shapes.
•  Let them put their shapes into templates.
•  Blindfold a child (or ask to close eyes). Have the child feel 
the outlines of shapes and identify the matching template. 
Repeat with other students.
•  After the activity, ask students to tell how they knew 
which shape would ﬁ t. Probe for speciﬁ c characteristics.
•  Accept their descriptions of the shapes.
•  Ask them to compare a selected shape to a circle and one 
shape to another. Write their observations about each 
shape on a chart or table.
Variations
•  Have students ﬁ nd shapes that ﬁ t into templates in their 
home (e.g., door into door frame, picture into picture 
frame).
•  Have students ﬁ nd pictures in magazines that show 
shapes, and make a picture book of shapes. Each child 
can make one, or the class can make a book together.
heptagon (7), octagon (8), enneagon (9), decagon 
(10). A regular polygon, such as a square, equi-
lateral triangle, or regular hexagon, has congruent 
sides and congruent angles. Figure 17.6 illustrates 
several regular and irregular polygons. Activity 17.8 
uses exemplars to help students clarify their concep-
tion of polygon. The activity also suggests a means 
to assess students’ understandings.
Points, Lines, Rays, Line Segments, 
and Angles
As children learn about two- and three-dimensional 
shapes, they also encounter geometric elements 
such as points, lines, rays, line segments, and line 
intersections, which provide the foundation for Eu-
clidean geometry. The abstract nature of geomet-
ric points and lines makes them difﬁ cult for many 
children to understand fully. For this reason young 
children learn about geometric shapes and their at-
tributes before learning about points, lines, rays, and 
angles. A point is actually a location in space that has 
no dimension; a line is a set of points that extends 
inﬁ nitely. This description of a line allows for curved 
and straight lines. In general, at the elementary level 
all lines in geometry are assumed to be straight lines

What Is a Polygon? (Assessment Activity)
Level: Grades 1– 4
Setting: Pairs of students or individual
Objective: Students develop a visual concept of polygon by exam-
ining polygons and nonpolygons.
Materials: Geometric ﬁ gures sheet
•  Pass out exemplars sheet to students.
•  Have students use the exemplars sheet to designate the 
ﬁ ve polygons in a set of 10 geometric ﬁ gures.
•  Have students display their polygon selections to the class 
and explain their choices.
Extension
•  Older students might compose a deﬁ nition of polygon 
using the exemplar sheet. After several students have 
shared their deﬁ nition with the class, students can 
discuss the various deﬁ nitions and develop a class 
deﬁ nition.
Assessment
•  After the class has heard and critiqued several potential 
deﬁ nitions, have each student write a deﬁ nition of poly-
gon in his or her notebook.

unless otherwise speciﬁ ed. The concepts of inﬁ nity 
() and something that has no dimensions are dif-
ﬁ cult ideas to conceptualize until age 11 and older. 
However, children can learn something about these 
abstract ideas through real objects and picture rep-
resentations. Activity 17.9 uses real materials to rep-
resent points, rays, and line segments.
A point can be represented by a dot, an inﬁ nite 
line by arrows on both ends of a drawn segment, a 
line segment as part of a line with a dot at each end, 
and a ray as part of a line with a dot at one end and 
an arrow at the other end (Figure 17.7). (Again, lines 
can also be curved, although the term line usually 
means a straight line in most geometry texts.)
point. If their heads are close together, their bodies 
form an acute angle; if their heads are far apart, their 
bodies form an obtuse angle. If they lie down on 
perpendicular lines with their feet at the same point, 
their bodies form a 90 angle.
Oak tag segments joined at one end with a me-
tallic paper fastener make good models of angles. In 
Figure 17.8 the oak tag segments show (a) an obtuse 
angle (greater than 90), (b) an acute angle (less than 
90), and (c) a right angle (90). Flexible soda straws 
can also represent angles. When the end of one ﬂ ex-
ible straw is ﬁ tted into the opposite end of another 
ﬂ exible straw, the ﬂ exible part of the straw serves as 
an effective vertex for the straw angle. This technique 
is used in Activity 17.10. Notice that in this activity 
children designate one of three angle categories for 
the angles. They do not stipulate a degree measure. 
Degree measure is a topic for older children.

Another angle activity is done with paper plates. 
Provide each student with paper plates on which 
the center has been marked. Students cut straight 
lines from the outside edge to the center to make 
acute, right, and obtuse angles. Pose challenges to 
older children such as these: “Can you cut a plate so 
that you have one obtuse and three acute angles? 
Can you cut a single plate so you have a right, an 
acute, and an obtuse angle?” Children can also chal-
lenge each other to make different combinations of 
angles. Older students learn the standard way to la-
bel angles. When rays BA and BC meet at point B, as 
shown in Figure 17.9, children learn that this angle 
can be named either ABC or CBA.

or ball of twine across the ﬁ eld as far as it will go.
•  Have the students line up across the ﬁ eld and hold onto 
the string to keep it taut. Tell them that the string is part 
of a line that keeps going forever, even after the string 
comes to an end. Ask what the line would touch as it 
moved beyond each end of the string.
•  Each student touching the string is a point on the line, 
and the space between each pair of them is a line seg-
ment, or part of the line.
•  Name points after the children, for example, Latasha, 
Jamal, Sera, Jason. Name line segments by calling the 
names of students: line segment Latasha-Jason. The 
named students hold onto the string, and the students 
between them let go. This shows how long each line seg-
ment is. Let students take turns calling pairs of names to 
identify line segments.
•  Ask students to remember which students are standing 
on either side of them. Return to the classroom, and draw 
a picture of a line and points on the chalkboard. Put an 
arrow at each end to indicate that the line keeps going in 
both directions. Ask students to label the points on the 
lines with their names.
•  Ask the students to describe how the chalkboard line rep-
resents their experience outdoors. (Answer: The arrows 
show that the line goes on without end. The points where 
students’ names appear show that a line segment has 
deﬁ nite ends. Two names identify speciﬁ c segments.)
•  Ask students to write the names for two different 
segments.
•  Draw a picture of a ray. Ask the students to tell what they 
see and what they think a ray is. (Answer: A ray includes 
an endpoint and all points extending in one direction 
from that point.)
•  Relabel the chalk drawing with A, B, C, D, . . . in place of 
the students’ names. Introduce how to write line, seg-
ment, and ray (notation).

Geometry in Three Dimensions: 
Space Figures
Children have daily experiences with three-dimen-
sional objects. Classroom activities with space 
ﬁ gures for children at van Hiele Stage 0 (visualiza-
tion) build on early experiences by using common 
three-dimensional models in familiar settings. A 
classroom grocery store contains boxes with many 
shapes and sizes. Cans are cylinders; cereal boxes 
are rectangular prisms; specialty boxes are collected 
to provide experiences with cones and pyramids. A 
scavenger hunt can be a search outside school for 
three-dimensional ﬁ gures for a classroom collec-
tion and display. Formal terms such as cylinder and 
rectangular prism are not necessary immediately but 
are introduced gradually as mathematical terminol-
ogy for objects that may be described by students as 
“rollers” and “boxes.”
In primary grades a block center with wooden 
or plastic blocks provides opportunities to construct 
three-dimensional structures. Older students also 
beneﬁ t from work with blocks—either standard 
blocks or desk sets of blocks—to construct houses, 
cities, furniture for dolls, or abstract arrangements. 
The companion website activity “Solid-Shape 
Search” involves children in ﬁ nding real-life objects 
that resemble models of solids, such as a cereal box 
that resembles a model of a rectangular prism or a 
tennis ball that resembles a sphere.
Analyzing and combining three-dimensional 
shapes is an important spatial objective. An art proj-
ect in which children build three-dimensional col-
lages from small cereal boxes and bathroom tissue 
and paper towel tubes gives them an opportunity to 
combine and rearrange three-dimensional ﬁ gures. 
Glue and tempera paints are the only materials 
needed. Some constructions may look like trucks or 
boats; others may be more fanciful. Simple carpen-
try projects using odds and ends of lumber also let 
children work with three-dimensional forms.
Children can build solids using clay or plasticine. 
Younger children simply make and talk about their 
creations; older children investigate the cross-sec-
tions of the various ﬁ gures (Figure 17.10). Depend-
ing on which three-dimensional solid is cut and how 
it is cut, the plane surfaces of the cross-sections are 
circles, ellipses, squares, triangles, rectangles, or

Materials: Two ﬂ exible straws fashioned into an angle
•  Draw an acute, a right, and an obtuse angle on the board.
•  Ask students to name each angle.
•  Write the name of each angle beneath it.
•  Hold up the ﬂ exible straw angle for students to see.
•  Quickly ask one student to name the angle you show.

one, and quickly form another angle.
•  Ask another student for the correct name of the new 
angle formed by the straws.
•  If a student answers correctly, repeat the name, and 
quickly form another angle.

student volunteers how they can tell the difference be-
tween acute, right, and obtuse angles.

Polyhedrons are space ﬁ gures made up of

ing “many” and “seat” (formed by two ﬂ at surfaces), 
so polyhedron means “many ﬂ at surfaces.” Commer-
cial materials such as Geoﬁ x Shapes are available 
for constructing three-dimensional shapes. Students 
can make their own space ﬁ gures with tagboard 
and other materials. Plastic soda straws and chenille 
pipe cleaners cut in 2-inch lengths can be used for 
an interesting investigation with solid ﬁ gures. Chil-
dren can build polyhedrons using gumdrops or mini-
marshmallows for vertex points and coffee stirrers 
as edges. Display or demonstrate a ﬁ gure built with 
such materials, and give students the opportunity 
to build their own polyhedrons. A pyramid formed 
by connecting four coffee stirrers to four gumdrops 
is easiest to make. Ask 
children to describe the 
solid (e.g., “It has four 
congruent faces that are 
the same size and shape; 
it has four vertices; it has 
six edges.”)
Children should be en-
couraged to use proper 
terms when describing a 
polyhedron or its parts.

Geometric Properties: 
Congruence and Similarity
Two polygons are congruent if one ﬁ ts exactly on 
the other. If all points on one line segment match 
exactly with all points on another segment, they are 
congruent. Any two plane or space ﬁ gures are con-
gruent when all their corresponding points match 
exactly. When children organize blocks by stacking 
the ones that ﬁ t on top of each other on the same 
shelf, they are demonstrating congruence. As stu-
dents stack up the yellow pattern blocks in a tower, 
they are showing that all the yellow blocks are con-
gruent. When students separate pattern blocks into 
their respective shapes, they are demonstrating con-
gruence. Congruence is also used in linear and area 
measurement. The width of a desk is matched to 37 
centimeter cubes lined up, and the area can be mea-
sured by covering the top with congruent squares. 
Students could use 37 different centimeter cubes to 
ﬁ nd another desk with the same width and use the 
same number of congruent squares to ﬁ nd a desk 
with the same area. Recognizing the congruence of 
length and area measurement units in geometry is 
a key to success in measurement. Uniform standard 
measures are based on the recognition of congru-
ence; the meter is still a meter whether measured 
with 10 decimeters or 100 centimeters.
Two polygons are similar when they have the 
same shape. When they have the same shape, they 
have congruent corresponding angles and their cor-
responding sides are all in the same ratio. Two regu-
lar polygons with the same number of sides must 
be similar. Regular polygons have all sides the same 
length and all angles the same size. Equilateral tri-
angles and squares are regular ﬁ gures. All squares 
and equilateral triangles are similar, because all 
squares have 90 angles and all equilateral triangles 
have 60 angles, and each pair of corresponding 
sides between two squares or between two equilat-
eral triangles will show the same ratio. Quadrilater-
als, pentagons, hexagons, or other polygons can 
be similar but are not necessarily so, because their 
angles may not be congruent and their correspond-
ing side lengths may have different ratios. The two 
quadrilaterals shown here are similar. Note that their 
corresponding angles are congruent (A  W, 
MISCONCEPTION
Many times children (and 
most adults) will use side 
when they mean a surface 
or face of the polyhedron. 
To help students use the 
correct term, teachers 
can contrast the side of a 
square with the face of a 
cube.

Children will ﬁ nd many examples of similarity 
as they work with the concepts of big and small. A 
set of counting bears contains small, medium, and 
large bears that have the same shape and propor-
tions but different sizes, as do the porridge bowls 
in Goldilocks and the Three Bears or the size of the 
doghouses in La Quintetta. Congruent and similar 
polygons are shown in Figure 17.11.
Younger children recognize similar ﬁ gures by in-
spection and will not give any explicit attention to 
congruent angles or the lengths of corresponding 
sides. Children’s understanding of congruence and 
similarity grows through activities with geometry 
materials. A typical attribute block set of 60 blocks 
includes blocks of ﬁ ve shapes, three colors, two 
thicknesses, and two sizes, as shown in the photo. 
Each block has a unique combination of four at-
tributes: shape, color, thickness, and size. Initially, 
children often sort with shape as the distinguishing 
attribute. They put the 60 pieces into subsets con-
sisting of circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, and 
hexagons. The teacher can foster thinking about 
size and shape with questions. “Why did you sort 
the blocks this way?” prompts children to explain 
that the pieces in each set have the same shape. 
“Are all the circles exactly the same size?” prompts 
them to notice and talk about the fact that some are 
large and some are small. Third- and fourth-graders 
can use the terms congruent and similar to describe 
their sorting. The teacher may point out that a large 
red square and a large blue square are congruent 
and that a large blue (or red) square and a small red 
square are similar. The teacher can then ask the chil-
dren to identify other examples of congruent and 
similar shapes.

Mirrors that allows children to create designs that 
contain lines of symmetry. Figure 17.13 illustrates a 
design created with such a program. Even the letters 
of the alphabet from different computer fonts and/or 
cultures offer an intriguing investigation of line and 
point symmetry and graphic design history.
Elementary students can recognize both line sym-
metry and rotational symmetry. Line symmetry can 
be visualized by considering a Hanukkah menorah 
(Figure 17.14a). If a symmetry line is drawn down the 
menorah’s stem, each side of the symmetry line is a 
mirror image of the other. 
Every example of line sym-
metry produces mirror im-
ages that can be “folded” 
along the symmetry line 
onto one another.
The second symmetry 
type, point or rotational 
symmetry, can be visu-
alized by considering a 
sunﬂ ower that is rotated 
about its center (Figure

appearance is virtually 
unchanged; the sunﬂ ower 
is symmetric around the 
center point.

symmetric. Students who show a top-down view of their 
object will have a design with line symmetry. Students 
with a side view will not.

Many students mistak-
enly conclude that if a 
ﬁ gure is divided into 
two congruent parts by 
a line, then the line must 
be a symmetry line. To 
help students overcome 
this misconception, they 
should have many experi-
ences examining ﬁ gures 
such as a rectangle with a 
diagonal, in which the line 
divides the rectangle into 
two congruent parts, but 
the diagonal is not a sym-
metry line. In this case the 
diagonal fails the fold test.

Symmetry introduces children to ﬂ ips. When 
children make “dab” patterns, such as the one illus-
trated in Activity 17.11, the right half of the paper is 
“ﬂ ipped” to create the symmetric pattern of paint 
on the left half. The two parts of the symmetric de-
sign are reﬂ ections of each other. In Activity 17.12 
students make a free-form design on a geoboard, 
then check the design for line symmetry.
the shapes themselves remain the same. Transla-
tions are sliding motions, rotations are turning mo-
tions, and reﬂ ections are ﬂ ipping motions. Slide, 
turn, and ﬂ ip are terms often used in elementary 
school; however, the terms translation, rotation, and 
reﬂ ection should be introduced as well.
Flips, turns, and slides are an integral part of work-
ing with tangram pieces (see Figure 17.16). Some 
writers claim that an old folktale relates the origin 
of the ﬁ rst tangram. In ancient China an emperor 
was carrying a square tile; he dropped it and saw it 
break into seven pieces. In the process of recreating 
the tile, he found that he could assemble the pieces 
to form many shapes besides the original square.

Although classroom sets of plastic tangram 
pieces are commercially available, children can 
trace them and cut the seven pieces from colored 
art board (see Black-Line Master 17.12). The seven 
tangram pieces can be used to make many recogniz-
able shapes, such as boats and birds, as well as fan-
ciful ﬁ gures. Figure 17.17 illustrates how to assemble 
the pieces to form a square and three other designs. 
Children can be challenged to use the seven pieces 
to make a design or ﬁ gure of their own.
Tangrams from commercial sources may have all 
the pieces of a design outlined on the easier task 
cards, with more difﬁ cult designs having only the 
outline of an entire ﬁ gure. Children’s original de-
signs, copied on 5  8 index cards, may be added to 
the commercial designs. Young children can begin 
with designs requiring only two or three tangram 
pieces. As they gain experience, they complete ﬁ ve-, 
six-, and seven-piece designs.

As children work with tangrams, geoboards, and 
nets, they constantly make transformational moves. 
The movements are a natural part of completing pic-
tures or reproducing designs. When children form 
ﬁ gures using tangram pieces, they slide, ﬂ ip, and ro-
tate pieces to place them in the proper position. All 
three motions, singly or in sequence, are involved in 
describing the moves. Children might describe the 
moves they make with one tangram piece as they 
are forming a tangram ﬁ gure.

Teaching and Learning About 
Coordinate Geometry
Places on a city map are often located using grid 
lines. The horizontal order (A, B, C, . . .) is joined, or 
coordinated, with the vertical order (1, 2, 3, . . .) to 
identify places on the map.
For instance, a school may be located on a map 
in the square labeled C-4. By looking across the 
map to C and up or down to 4, readers can ﬁ nd the 
school and its nearby streets and landmarks. This 
coordinate grid is a mathematical contribution of 
René Descartes (1596– 1650) and is the basis for 
coordinate geometry, sometimes called Carte-
sian geometry.
Elementary school children can be introduced to 
the coordinate plane through activities that extend 
their use of number lines. Children use a single num-
ber line to show addition and subtraction by moving 
forward and backward on the line. The coordinate 
grid is formed by two number lines—one extending 
E
horizontally and the other vertically. The numbers 
or letters on each number line become the loca-
tion markers for the coordinate grid. Activity 17.13 
is designed to develop children’s understanding of 
points and lines on the coordinate plane. It applies 
the coordinate plane to the classroom seating plan.
Figure 17.17 Tangram ﬁ gures
One account of Descartes’s life suggests that he ﬁ rst got the 
idea of coordinate geometry while lying in bed one morn-
ing, trying to describe the path of a ﬂ y crawling across his 
bedroom ceiling!
A square geoboard is arranged as a coordinate 
plane. Children who have worked with geoboards 
already know that its pegs form a grid, so naming 
the pegs with coordinate numbers is easily done. In 
Activity 17.14 children develop the guess-and-check 
problem-solving strategy by locating objects on the 
grid. A coordinate grid puzzle can be made by col-
oring various shapes on a 10  10 grid. Clues along 
each edge show how many spaces are ﬁ lled in each 
line. Figure 17.18 shows one puzzle to be solved by 
Find where the worm and two flowers 
are, using clues at edge of grid.

Materials: Geoboard for each partner, washers (painted two col-

•  Mark geoboards with numbers from 0 to 9 across the 
bottom and up the left side.
•  One student secretly places ﬁ ve washers of one color in a 
row on pegs going vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
•  The second student, who cannot see the ﬁ rst board, 
makes guesses to locate the ﬁ ve washers. A guess consists 
of naming a point (“I guess point 2, 3”) on the grid. The 
ﬁ rst student answers yes if there is a washer in that posi-
tion. If there is not, the answer is no. Both students keep 
track of guesses by putting washers of the other color on 
“no” pegs.
•  Ask students to create a scoring procedure. The game can

coordinating the information given along each edge 
of the coordinate grid.
The coordinate grid can also be used to mark off 
a picture for a scale drawing. The picture is enlarged 
by drawing each piece of the grid on a large square 
and reassembling the result. Figure 17.19 shows a 
picture and portions of its enlarged version using 
coordinate squares. This activity can also be used 
with older children when studying symmetry. The 
original ﬁ gure and its enlargement are similar to 
each other.

facets of geometry through a variety of engaging ac-
tivities. They build, draw, explore, and design indi-
vidual and composite geometric shapes in two and

•  Ask a student to stand at the origin and call out the coor-
dinate addresses of students you name. Repeat for several 
more students.
•  Ask students to give their coordinates from their seats.

•  Call out two pairs of coordinates, and ask those students 
to exchange seats or move into an empty seat.
•  For older students the origin might be moved to produce 
negative coordinates.

with activities that extend their sense of observation 
and concentration. Their experiences lay the foun-
dation for extending geometry thinking in the inter-
mediate grades.
Extending Geometry Concepts
Children at the intermediate level continue to de-
velop and expand their knowledge of geometry. 
They still engage in activities to enhance their spa-
tial sense, especially with the interplay of two- and 
three-dimensional representations. Topics that were 
introduced and considered at the visualization Van 
Hiele stage in earlier grades, such as similarity, 
symmetry, and transformations, are now studied 
in greater depth. New topics include dilations, the 
Pythagorean theorem, and formal coordinate geom-
etry. These new topics are reﬂ ected in the NCTM 
geometry standards for older children.
NCTM Geometry Standard
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 
8 should enable all students to:

ACTIVITY 17.15
 
The Mobius Strip
Level: Grades 2– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Children explore the properties of the Mobius strip.
Materials: Paper tape, transparent tape
•  Have groups cut three strips of paper tape for each mem-
ber of the group. The strips should be approximately 12 
inches long and 11
2 inches wide.
•  Demonstrate to the class how to create a Mobius strip.
•  Have students create their own Mobius strips.
•  Ask groups to perform the following explorations and re-
cord their ﬁ ndings. Before children perform each explora-
tion, have them write out their predictions.
1.  Draw a line down the middle of the Mobius strip. 
Keep drawing until the line meets itself. (Predict 
before you draw.)
2.  Cut the Mobius strip along the whole length of the 
line in Step 1. (Predict before you cut.)
3.  Make another Mobius strip. This time twist one end 
with a full turn before taping. Draw a line down 
the middle of this new band and then cut along the 
entire line. (Predict before you draw and cut.)
•  Have groups report their ﬁ ndings. How did their predic-
tions compare with their results?
How closely do their recorded descriptions match their 
actual results?
Variation
•  Older children use a new Mobius strip and draw a line 1
3 of 
the width in from the edge of the band. Children will have 
to go around twice before the line meets itself. Now they 
can cut along the whole length of the line.
•  Children tape two paper chain links together and cut 
along the dotted lines as shown here. Again, ask for a 
prediction before children perform the exploration.
•  draw geometric objects with speciﬁ ed properties, such as 
side lengths or angle measures;
•  use two-dimensional representations of three-dimen-
sional objects to visualize and solve problems such as 
those involving surface area and volume;
•  use visual tools such as networks to represent and solve 
problems;
•  use geometric models to represent and explain numerical 
and algebraic relationships;
•  recognize and apply geometric ideas and relationships in 
areas outside the mathematics classroom, such as art, sci-
ence, and everyday life.
Students at these grade levels continue to improve 
their spatial sense through a variety of activities that 
use concrete manipulatives. Although children may 
have engaged in activities to improve their spatial 
sense in earlier grades, they beneﬁ t from activities 
that continue to extend their spatial sense. Activity 
17.15 can be used with a wide range of students. 
The activity examines the Mobius strip, a shape with 
unusual properties, not the least of which is that it 
has only one side or surface (Figure 17.20). Students 
predict and then describe the resulting shapes that 
these activities with the Mobius strip can produce. 
A Mobius strip is formed by attaching the ends of 
a strip of paper to each other, much like a link in a 
paper chain. The only difference is that one end of 
the paper strip is twisted a half-turn (180) before 
taping the ends together.

section are adaptable for 
Figure 17.20 A Mobius strip
MISCONCEPTION
Many children expect 
squares to be oriented 
so that the top and bot-
tom are parallel to the 
top and bottom of the 
geoboard. Thus they will 
not recognize a square 
that is oriented so that the 
square is in a tilted posi-
tion. Children usually call 
such a shape a diamond 
and not a square, much as 
adults call a baseball play-
ing ﬁ eld a diamond, when 
it is actually a square.

ACTIVITY 17.16
 
Searching for Squares
Level: Grades 3– 6
Setting: Pairs of students or individual
Objective: Students ﬁ nd all the different-size squares on a 
geoboard regardless of orientation.
Materials: Dot paper, geoboards, rubber bands
•  Give each pair of students a geoboard, several rubber 
bands, and dot paper.
•  Challenge students to ﬁ nd as many different-size squares 
as possible on their geoboard.
•  Most students will ﬁ nd the four squares shown on the 
geoboard.
•  Encourage students to look for other squares shown be-
low the geoboard. Suggest that they change the orienta-
tion of the geoboard to help in their search.
children working at van Hiele Stage 1 (identifying 
characteristics of each shape) and Stage 2 (looking 
for relationships among shapes).
Pentominoes are two-dimensional ﬁ gures made 
by joining ﬁ ve equal-size squares in different ways. 
Twelve different pentominoes can be formed using 
combinations of ﬁ ve squares. In Activity 17.17 stu-
dents try to form all the pentominoes. A common 
error that students make in this activity is to form 
reﬂ ections or rotations of previously found pen-
tominoes. Figure 17.21 shows the same pentomino 
in different orientations. The second pentomino is 
a rotation of the ﬁ rst, and the third pentomino is a 
reﬂ ection of the ﬁ rst. In Activity 17.17 the focus is 
on ﬁ nding all the pentominoes without any duplica-
tions resulting from rotations or reﬂ ections.
E X E RC I S E
Which pentomino pieces do you believe can be 
folded into open boxes? Discuss this question with 
a classmate. Do you agree on your choices? How 
can you demonstrate which ones will fold into 
boxes? •••
Intermediate-grade children should include 
three-dimensional shapes in their spatial visualiza-
tion activities. Moreover, the relationships between 
two-dimensional representations of three-dimen-
sional ﬁ gures should also be explored by means of 
work with isometric drawings (see Activity 17.2) and 
also with nets. A net is a two-dimensional shape 
that can be cut, folded, and taped to form a geo-
metric solid. Certain pentominoes can be consid-
ered the nets of an open box. Some combinations 
of six squares can be folded into cubes, and oth-
ers cannot. Students could use Geoﬁ x Shapes (or 
nets drawn and cut out from 1-inch graph paper) to

ACTIVITY 17.17
 
How Many Pentominoes?
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups or individual
Objective: Students try to assemble the 12 different pentominoes.
Materials: Five square tiles, 1-inch graph paper
•  Demonstrate to students how the square tiles must ﬁ t 
together.
Right
Wrong
•  Challenge students to ﬁ nd all possible pentominoes by 
making an organized search.
•  Students should sketch each of their combinations on 
graph paper.
•  If a group cannot ﬁ nd all 12 pentominoes, they may send 
a representative to a group that has found them all. The 
visiting representative can look at the group’s sketches 
and then return to relate which pentominoes are missing.
•  Have students categorize their 12 pentominoes into 
several groups, using a scheme they devise. Ask a reporter 
to present the group’s results and explain their categori-
zation scheme. After ﬁ nding all the pentominoes in this 
activity, students must provide an argument that there are 
no others. Some ineffective arguments will take the form 
of “We can’t ﬁ nd any more pentominoes, so these are 
all there are.” Probe for arguments that relate to possible 
combinations of pentominoes, such as “There is one pen-
tomino with ﬁ ve squares in a row,” “There are only two 
pentominoes with four squares in a row,” and so forth.
Extension
•  Ask students to determine which 8 of the 12 pentominoes 
will fold up into a box with an open top. After students 
have categorized each pentomino as either able or not 
able to be folded into a box, allow groups to draw each 
pentomino on graph paper. They can then cut out each 
pentomino and verify whether it can be folded to form an 
open box. See the companion website activity “Nets of a 
Cube” for a similar activity involving the nets of a cube. 
Another companion website activity, “This Side Up,” 
provides students with the opportunity to cut up boxes to 
form nets, which they then analyze.

website activity “Nets of a Cube.”
Classifying Polygons
The earliest van Hiele stage is visualization, where 
children recognize some general forms of geomet-
ric shapes but make no analysis or comparisons be-
tween the shapes. Children at the intermediate-grade 
level begin to examine two- and three-dimensional 
shapes to determine their characteristics and criti-
cal attributes for identiﬁ cation. Squares and rectan-
gles are familiar shapes to even young children. The 
activities for this section involve explorations with 
these and other familiar quadrilaterals. Activity 17.18 
asks children to gather data about the attributes of 
various quadrilaterals. See the companion website 
activity “Exploring Diagonals of Quadrilaterals” for 
further explorations involving the diagonals of quad-
rilaterals. Activities 17.19 and 17.20 are designed for 
students who are entering the van Hiele analysis 
stage. In Activity 17.19 students create speciﬁ c quad-
rilaterals out of a long piece of yarn and then defend 
their ﬁ nal result by referencing the attributes of the 
speciﬁ c quadrilateral. In Activity 17.20 children try 
to categorize quadrilaterals in terms of their com-
mon attributes. In this activity children wrestle with 
deciding whether a square is always a rectangle or 
whether a rectangle is always a square.
Note that the template for the Venn diagrams in 
Activity 17.18 will accommodate trapezoids if the 
deﬁ nition of a trapezoid is that it is a quadrilateral 
with only one pair of parallel sides. In this case a trap-
ezoid is unlike any of the other quadrilaterals and so 
should be placed in one of the two separate circles 
in the Venn diagram. Some texts deﬁ ne a trapezoid 
as a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel 
sides. According to this deﬁ nition a parallelogram 
(or rectangle, rhombus, or square) is a trapezoid (all

Yarn Quadrilaterals
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students create large quadrilaterals out of yarn by using 
the appropriate attributes.
Materials: Yarn (30– 40 feet for each group)
•  This activity is best done in a large open area, such as the 
gymnasium or outside the classroom.
•  Give each group of ﬁ ve students a length of yarn.
•  Challenge students to use their entire length of yarn to 
form a speciﬁ c quadrilateral. Select from the following list: 
parallelogram, rectangle, square, kite, rhombus, trapezoid.
•  Suggest to students that they should justify their ﬁ nished 
shape by referring to appropriate attributes and not simply 
because “it looks like it.”
•  Once students have formed a ﬁ gure and provide a ratio-
nale for it being the correct shape, have them record in 
their journals the ﬁ gure by name and diagram and the 
attributes they used to be sure the shape is correct.
•  Repeat with other quadrilaterals.

diagram for this trapezoid deﬁ nition would appear 
as follows. It is important for teachers to determine 
which of the deﬁ nitions a text or state mathematics 
framework speciﬁ es and then select the correct dia-
gram for this activity.
Children thinking at van Hiele Stage 0 or 1 have 
great difﬁ culty categorizing a square as a rectan-
gle. They view squares and rectangles as distinct 
polygons
In the lower grades children work with various 
triangles and learn to recognize them by both angle 
and sides. Younger students use informal descrip-
tions, but older students learn standard terms to de-
scribe triangles. The activity “Exploring Triangles” 
on the companion website describes a lesson on 
triangles for intermediate grades. Children create 
many different types of triangles during this activity 
and classify them. Triangles classiﬁ ed by their sides 
are equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. Equilateral 
triangles have three equal, or congruent, sides; 
isosceles triangles have two congruent sides; and 
scalene triangles have no congruent sides. Tri-
angles can also be classiﬁ ed by their angles. Right 
triangles have a 90 angle. All angles in acute tri-
angles are less than 90; obtuse triangles have 
one angle larger than 90 (see Figure 17.22).
ACTIVITY 17.20
 
Categorizing Quadrilaterals
Level: Grades 5– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Children categorize quadrilaterals.
Materials: Venn diagram sheet
•  Give each student a copy of the Venn diagram shown 
here, and have them place in the diagram the following 
quadrilaterals: square, trapezoid, rectangle, rhombus, 
parallelogram, kite.
•  Have students in each group compare their individual ef-
fort, and then design a Venn diagram for the entire group.
•  When all groups are ﬁ nished, have each group post their 
results and then discuss them with the entire class.
•  Possible questions for discussion:
• Is a rectangle always a square?
• How is a rhombus like a square?
• How are rectangles like squares?
Many geometric terms are derived from ancient Greek words 
that are related to the attributes of the ﬁ gure. Isosceles is 
derived from Greek words meaning “equal legs”; scalene is 
taken from the Greek word for “uneven.”

Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Individuals
Objective: Students ﬁ nd a pattern associated with the number of 
sides and the number of diagonals in polygons.
Materials: Geoboard, rubber bands, unﬁ nished table for recording 
answers
•  Have students make the following ﬁ gures on a geoboard: 
triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon. Use rubber bands to 
show the diagonals in each ﬁ gure.
•  Have students write the number of sides and diagonals for 
each ﬁ gure in the table presented here.

•  Now have the students make other ﬁ gures, each one 
having one more side than the last. Have them write the 
number of sides and the number of diagonals for each of 
these new ﬁ gures in the table.
•  When at least six ﬁ gures have been listed in the table, 
have the students study it to ﬁ nd a pattern. Ask the 
students to use the pattern to predict the number of 
diagonals in the remaining ﬁ gures in the table.
•  Ask students to explain how they found the number of 
diagonals in the ﬁ gure with 10 sides.
•  Have students develop a number sentence (formula) for 
ﬁ nding the number of diagonals in a ﬁ gure with any 
number of sides.
By the end of ﬁ fth or sixth grade, children should 
be able to name and describe the attributes of 
common polygons, see relationships between and 
among polygons based on attributes, and begin to 
categorize polygons according to their characteris-
tics rather than their appearance.
Activity 17.21 is an assessment activity that ex-
amines children’s process and results as they gather 
data about the number of diagonals in various poly-
gons. They use their data to generate a conjecture 
about the pattern for the number of diagonals in 
polygons and then look for a number sentence or 
a formula to represent the number of diagonals in 
polygons.
Extending Geometry 
in Three Dimensions
At the upper elementary level children begin to 
analyze polyhedrons, ﬁ nd their surface areas and 
volumes, and explore relationships among them. 
A polyhedron with congruent faces, with the same 
number of faces meeting at each vertex, is a regular 
solid. There are ﬁ ve such regular solids. They are 
called Platonic solids after the Greek philosopher 
Plato, who lived about 428– 348 B.C.E. The Platonic 
solids are shown in Figure 17.23: (a) a hexahedron, 
or cube, (b) a tetrahedron, (c) an octahedron, (d) 
a dodecahedron, and (e) an icosahedron. Tetrahe-
drons, hexahedrons, and octahedrons can reason-
ably be made with commonly used materials for 
making solid ﬁ gures (see page 406). The other two 
Platonic solids, dodecahedrons and icosahedrons, 
have many faces and vertices and are tedious to 
assemble with any of these materials. Commercial 
materials such as Geoﬁ x Shapes are more suitable 
for building them. If such building materials are not 
available, students can cut out nets of the various 
polyhedrons (See Black-Line Masters 17.9, 17.10, and 
17.11). The nets can be folded up and taped to form 
the polyhedron. Ask students to create other polyhe-
drons with their materials; then have them discuss 
and critique the ﬁ gures.
Both commercial and teacher-made materials 
can help children visualize solid ﬁ gures represented

•  Once students have collected their data and checked for 
accuracy, challenge them to ﬁ nd the relationship, known 
as Euler’s formula, that exists between the number of 
faces, vertex points, and edges of all polyhedrons.
In Activity 17.22 children expand their spatial 
sense by examining three-dimensional ﬁ gures for a 
pattern in the number of faces, edges, and vertices. 
The result is that children use their data to discover 
Euler’s formula. Euler’s formula is V  F  E  2, 
where V represents the number of vertex points, F is 
the number of faces, and E is the number of edges. 
For a cube Euler’s formula is 8  6  12  2.

Extending Congruence and Similarity
Geoboard activities with congruence and similarity 
are described in Activities 17.23 and 17.24. A teacher 
who observes children as they complete the activi-
ties gains insight into their capabilities in following 
directions and understanding the concept of ratio. 
Similarity is related to ratio, or the proportional 
thinking needed for reading a map or an architect’s 
drawing. The scale for each map shows a ratio be-
tween the distance between two locations shown 
on the map and the same distance as it is in reality. 
Thus a map that shows the streets in a village will 
have a different scale from a map of the same size 
that shows the major highways of an entire state. In 

ACTIVITY 17.23
 
Similarity and Congruence
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Whole class or small groups
Objective: Students create similar and congruent ﬁ gures.
Materials: Geoboards, rubber bands
•  Show a right triangle on your geoboard. Have the stu-
dents duplicate this triangle on their boards. Ask whether, 
or remind students that, the triangles are congruent.
•  Have the students make two congruent triangles that are 
different from the one you showed them. Have students 
give their geoboard to a classmate to check that the tri-
angles are congruent. Repeat several times, and monitor. 
Students can also make a triangle for others to match.
•  Show your triangle again. This time, ask the students to 
make one that is like yours but with each vertical and 
horizontal side only half as long. Identify the two triangles 
as similar.
•  Discuss how your triangle and theirs are alike and 
different.
•  Make a table of the lengths of line segments for each 
triangle.
•  Ask the students to create two new triangles—one with 
sides that are two times as long as the other. Monitor 
their work, and assess their understanding.
•  Distinguish between congruent and similar. If their triangle 
and yours are alike in all ways, then they are congruent. 
If the triangles are alike in shape but are either smaller or 
larger, then they are similar.
Challenge
•  Ask students to make similar and congruent pictures of 
squares, rectangles, hexagons, octagons, and their own 
shapes. Post their pictures on a bulletin board labeled

similar ﬁ gures each pair of corresponding sides is in 
the same proportion. The corresponding angles are 
congruent. The ratio between corresponding sides 
is explored in Activities 17.23– 17.25. Activity 17.23 
helps students discern the difference between con-
gruent and similar ﬁ gures. In Activity 17.24 students 
build similar ﬁ gures. In Activity 17.25 students use a 
rubber band as a tool to draw similar ﬁ gures.
Extending Concepts of Symmetry
At the upper elementary level students examine 
symmetry lines in ﬁ gures and represent line sym-
metry on a coordinate plane. The companion web-
site activity “Symmetry in Letters” asks students to 
consider block capital letters in terms of line sym-
metry and then to form entire words or names with 
line symmetry. Activity 17.26 uses pattern blocks to 
develop a strong sense of line symmetry. Students 
can verify the line symmetry of a pattern block de-
sign by using a nonbreakable mirror or by reﬂ ecting 
one-half of the design onto the other half with a re-
ﬂ ecting manipulative such as a Mira (Figure 17.24). 
In Activity 17.27 students draw multiple symmetry 
lines for various ﬁ gures.

•  Have students tie a knot in the middle of their rubber 
band and then use it to enlarge a polygon they have 
drawn by tracing out the ﬁ gure with the knot of their 
rubber band.
•  Student pairs then use rulers to measure the correspond-
ing sides to check if their enlargements have side lengths 
twice as long as the side lengths of their original ﬁ gure.
•  Have students conjecture about drawing a new ﬁ gure 
with a rubber band that has a knot that is at 1
3 the length 
of the rubber band. How will the side lengths of the 
new ﬁ gure compare to the side lengths of the original 
ﬁ gure?
•  Students draw the new ﬁ gure and measure side lengths to 
verify their conjecture.

Building Similar Triangles
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students construct similar triangles and examine their 
attributes.
Materials: Rulers (yardsticks are best), masking tape
•  Draw a triangle on the board. Ask two student volunteers 
to each draw a triangle on the board that is similar but not 
congruent to the one you drew.
•  Ask students to describe similar ﬁ gures based on the 
sketches on the board.
•  Pass out the masking tape and yardsticks. Ask each group 
of students to make a scalene triangle on the ﬂ oor using 
the tape. The lengths of the three sides should range 
between 1 foot and 2 feet.
•  Students will use the 
yardsticks and tape 
to make an enlarged 
triangle. To do this, they 
measure the lengths of 
two sides and extend 
each side a distance 
equal to the original 
side length.
•  Once the two sides are extended, students can use tape 
to connect the ends of the extended sides to complete 
the enlarged triangle.
•  Have students measure the length of the original third 
side and the length of the enlarged third side and com-
pare the two lengths.
•  Have students compare corresponding angles in the two 
triangles.
•  Encourage students to record their ﬁ ndings and report 
their ﬁ ndings to the entire class.
•  Repeat the entire process, but this time mark the midpoint 
of the original two sides of the triangle and connect the 
midpoints to form the third side of a smaller triangle.

Extending Concepts of 
Transformational Geometry
At the upper elementary level students examine the 
translations more closely, moving beyond simply 
identifying a particular translation. They look for pat-
terns in translations and explore translations on the

Symmetry Designs
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Pairs of students
Objective: Students create designs with pattern blocks to display 
symmetry.
Materials: Pattern blocks, Mira or mirror
•  Students work in pairs to create a symmetric 
design by making mirror images of each other’s 
design pieces.
•  To begin, each pair of students draws a line 
down the middle of a piece of paper.
•  One student places a pattern block so it 
touches the line but does not cross it.
•  The partner places a pattern block on the op-
posite side of the line so it has line symmetry 
with the ﬁ rst pattern block.
•  The same student places a second block on his 
or her side of the line, touching the ﬁ rst block. 
The partner must place a second block on the 
opposite side of the line to show line symmetry.
•  Students continue alternating turns until 
at least 10 pattern block pieces are on 
the paper.
•  If students cannot agree on whether a 
pattern block shows pattern symmetry, 
they can use a reﬂ ecting mirror or a 
Mira to determine whether it does or 
not.
Variation
•  Students build a design with pattern 
blocks using at least 12 pieces. The 
piece must show symmetry.
•  Symmetry can be veriﬁ ed by plac-
ing a mirror or Mira along the line of 
symmetry.

Lines of Symmetry
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Whole class or small groups
Objective: Students determine the number of different lines of 
symmetry for various polygons.
Materials: Cutouts of a square, rectangle, equilateral triangle, isos-
celes triangle, regular pentagon, and other regular and irregular 
polygons
•  Challenge students to determine how many different lines 
of symmetry each ﬁ gure has.
•  Have students cut out the ﬁ gures and fold them or use a 
Mira to verify the lines of symmetry.
•  Have the students record in a table the number of lines of 
symmetry for each shape.
•  Ask students if they see a relationship between the 
number of sides and the number of lines of symmetry 
in a regular polygon. Does this relationship hold for a 
rectangle and an isosceles triangle? What about the other 
polygons? Are there any ﬁ gures that have no lines of sym-
metry? What can be said about their shapes?

coordinate plane. In addition, they begin to study a 
new translation, dilations. In Activity 17.28 students 
explore the properties of reﬂ ections in a coordinate 
grid. The companion website activity “Reﬂ ecting 
Figures in a Coordinate Grid” leads students to con-
clude that the commutative law holds for reﬂ ections 
across coordinate axes. That is, the result when a ﬁ g-
ure is reﬂ ected across the x-axis and then the y-axis 
is identical to the result when a ﬁ gure is reﬂ ected 
across the y-axis ﬁ rst and then across the x-axis. In 
Activity 17.29 students describe the series of transla-
tions required to move a ﬁ gure from one position to 
another on a coordinate grid.
Younger children become familiar with slides 
(translations), ﬂ ips (reﬂ ections) and turns (rota-
tions). A fourth type of transformation is a dilation, 
which is different from the other three transforma-
tions. A dilation in geometry is related to the dilation 
of the eye, the shrinking and enlarging of the pupil. 
In a dilation the resulting ﬁ gure is not congruent to 
the original ﬁ gure. Instead it is similar. A stick ﬁ g-
ure on a deﬂ ated balloon can demonstrate a dila-
tion to children. As the balloon is inﬂ ated, the stick 
ﬁ gure is enlarged. It changes size, but at each stage 
of inﬂ ation the stick ﬁ gure resembles the original 
ﬁ gure and is similar to it. Software programs such 
as MapQuest feature a magnifying glass on close-
up, which essentially dilates, or expands, the image 
on the screen. Activity 17.26 used rubber bands to 
produce similar ﬁ gures that were enlargements of a 
given plane ﬁ gure. The resulting ﬁ gures were dila-
tions of the original ﬁ gure. Activity 17.30 examines 
dilations in a coordinate grid.
Tessellations. Tiling patterns, or tessellations, 
are made when a surface is completely covered with 
one geometric ﬁ gure or a combination of ﬁ gures in 
a repeating pattern. Figure 17.25a illustrates a tessel-
lation made with squares, Figure 17.25b a tessella-
tion with triangles, Figure 17.25c a tessellation with 
regular hexagons, Figure 17.25d a tessellation with 
combinations of hexagons and triangles at each 
point, and Figure 17.25e a tessellation with octagons 
and squares.
Tessellations are a wonderful source of multicul-
tural connections. Tessellations are found in archi-
tecture, in quilting, and in the artwork of various cul-
tures. Ceramic tiles in buildings are often arranged 
in a repeated pattern of geometric shapes. Many 
quilts have an overall pattern of individual squares 
made from fabric shapes with a coordinated color

Reﬂ ecting Points on a Coordinate Grid
Level: Grade 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students will explore symmetry attributes on a coordi-
nate grid.
Materials: Graph paper
•  Review for students that when a point is reﬂ ected across 
a line, the resulting image point is the same distance from 
the symmetry line as the original point.
•  Pass out graph paper, and ask students to plot the points 
shown here on the graph paper.

scheme. The baskets, pottery, beadwork, and rugs 
of Native American artists often involve tessellated 
patterns. Lyn Taylor and her associates have writ-
ten about cooperative group tessellation activities 
among Native Americans. They believe that because 
most Native American cultures are group oriented 
and emphasize cooperation, the noncompetitive 
nature of these activities can foster cross-cultural 
understanding among students of all ethnic groups. 
The creation of tessellations helps to develop spatial 
visualization skills. During their exploration of pat-
tern blocks, children ﬁ nd which blocks ﬁ t together 
to cover the surface with no gaps and build an ini-
tial understanding of the tessellation concept. Older 
children ﬁ nd even more complex combinations of 
shapes that tessellate a surface. Squares, rectangles, 
equilateral triangles, and regular hexagons tessel-
late by themselves, and some can be combined 
in a recurring pattern (Figure 17.26). Regular pen-
tagons and octagons leave gaps that must be ﬁ lled 
with another shape. An open-ended probe such 
as “What do you notice about shapes that tessel-
late alone?” helps children focus on the geometric 
properties of the shapes. Younger children will fo-
cus on equal side lengths among ﬁ gures that tessel-
late. Older children will be able to relate the angle 
ACTIVITY 17.29
 
Geometric Transformations
Level: Grades 3– 6
Setting: Student pairs
Objective: Students identify the transformation (moves) that a 
shape might take from one position to another.
Materials: Several congruent triangle cutouts, art paper
•  Display a triangle on the overhead projector. Ask student 
pairs to glue one triangle on their paper and label it #1.
•  Put a second triangle on the overhead. Ask: “If I move 
triangle #1 to where triangle #2 is, how would I have to 
move it?” Help the students recognize that you might 
have to slide it, rotate it, ﬂ ip it, or perhaps make a combi-
nation of moves to put it in the second location. Repeat 
with other triangle placements.
•  Ask students to glue several other triangles on their paper, 
making some upside down, backward, and on end. Label 
their other triangles #2, #3, #4, and so on.
•  Ask: “If you move triangle #1 to where your triangle #2 is, 
which translations would you have to make to move it?” 
Remind them that they may need to slide it, rotate it, ﬂ ip 
it, or make a combination of moves.
•  Have pairs discuss what needs to be done to the ﬁ rst 
triangle to put it in the position of the other triangles. 
Tell the recorder for each pair to write a list of the 
movement(s) for triangles #2, #3, #4, and so on.
Extension
•  Ask students to write directions on an index card of how 
to move a shape from a starting place to an ending place 
using slides, ﬂ ips, and turns. These directions are a puzzle 
for others to solve. Put answers on the back of the card. 
You might also introduce the notation for translations. For 
example, the notation (x, y) → (x  4, y  2) describes 
moving the point 4 units to the right and 2 units down.

measures of the shapes to their ability to tessellate. 
The sum of the angles at every vertex in a tessella-
tion must total 360. Thus equilateral triangles will 
tessellate, with six triangles at each vertex (6  60
 360); squares will tessellate, with four squares at 
each vertex (4  90  360); and regular hexagons 
will tessellate, with three hexagons at each vertex 
(3  120  360).
After students have had ample opportunity to 
use pattern blocks and cut-out shapes to explore 
tessellations, square and triangular dot paper will 
allow children to copy, ex-
tend, and create their own 
simple tessellations.
More intricate tessella-
tion shapes are formed us-
ing a technique called the 
bite-and-push method. The 
steps for creating a tessel-
lation using the bite-and-
push method are shown in 
Figure 17.27. Begin with a 
simple tessellating shape, 
such as a square (Figure 
17.27a). Take a “bite” out of 
one side by cutting a piece 
from one edge. Put the 
bite exactly across the ﬁ gure on the opposite side by 
sliding it across (Figure 17.27b) and taping it to the 
opposite edge (Figure 17.27c). It will look as though 
the shape has been pushed from one side to the 
other. The student may stop here and use the new 
piece as a pattern for a tessellation design or may 
cut a second piece from the bottom of the square, 
slide it to the top, and tape it (Figure 17.27d). Once

Objective: Students explore characteristics of dilations on a coor-
dinate grid.

•  Direct students to draw a triangle on the coordinate 
grid.
•  Explain to students the meaning of (x, y) → (2x, 2y) 
in terms of dilations.
•  Ask students to plot the resulting ﬁ gure from (x, y) → 
(2x, 2y) and to compare the side lengths of the original 
ﬁ gure and the resulting enlargement.
•  Repeat for (3x, 3y)
•  Ask students to show how they might produce a ﬁ gure 
with side lengths that are ﬁ ve times the side lengths of 
their original ﬁ gure.
•  Have groups report their ﬁ ndings. How did their predic-
tions compare with their results?

satisﬁ ed with the self-created tessellation piece, the 
student uses it to create and color a tessellated pat-
tern (Figure 17.27e). Other designs can be added to 
each piece to enhance its appearance or to further 
relate to a real object or animal, as do so many of the 
works of M. C. Escher.
The works of Dutch artist M. C. Escher (1898– 
1972) interest many children. Escher drew many tes-
sellations in his body of work. Some tessellation de-
signs show the metamorphosis of one creature into 
another; changing a bird into a ﬁ sh is accomplished 
with subtle changes in the tessellating shapes. Li-
brary books and prints of Escher’s art show a con-
nection between geometry and art.
The Pythagorean Theorem. The most famous 
formula in all of mathematics describes the relation-
ship between the side lengths of a right triangle. It is 
the Pythagorean theorem, named after Greek math-
ematician Pythagoras. The theorem states that the 
sum of the squares of the legs of any right triangle is 
equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse. 
Using the right triangle shown here, the theorem 
can be represented in the familiar formula.
a
a 2  b 2  c 2
c
b
In the formula a and b represent either of the two 
leg lengths and c is the length of the longest side, the 
hypotenuse. Students who understand the concept 
of squaring a number can begin initial explorations 
with the Pythagorean theorem. Activity 17.31 asks 
students to cut up squares to show the relationship 
of side lengths in the Pythagorean theorem. In Black-
Line Master 17.13 students cut up an a-square (area 
of a-square  a  a, or a2) and a b-square (area of 
b-square  b  b, or b2) and rearrange the pieces 
to form a c-square (area of c-square  c  c, or c2). 
In Black-Line Master 17.14 students cut up a square 
of side c and reform the pieces to form two smaller 
squares, one with a side length a and one with a 
side length b. Thus for both activities the area of an 
a-square  the area of a b-square equals the area of 
a c-square, or a2  b2  c2.
In addition to gaining a foundational understand-
ing of the Pythagorean theorem, students can also 
use the theorem to determine whether any triangles 
are right triangles. To do so, students need simply 
to substitute the three side lengths of a particular 
triangle into the Pythagorean theorem. If the side 
lengths ﬁ t the Pythagorean theorem (see Activity 
17.32), then the triangle is a right triangle. When 
determining whether a triangle is a right triangle, 
students must be careful to substitute the length of 
the hypotenuse for c in the equation. For example, 
a triangle with side lengths 3, 5, and 4 is a right tri-
angle because 32  42  52, but a triangle with side 
lengths of 8, 9, and 10 is not a right triangle because 
82  92  102. The companion website activity “Cate-
gorizing Triangles Using the Pythagorean Theorem” 
extends the relationship. Students can identify acute 
and obtuse triangles by using a calculator to exam-
ine whether a2  b2  c2 (acute) or a2  b2 	 c2 
(obtuse).
Students in upper middle school can use the 
Pythagorean theorem to solve various geometry 
problems involving right triangles. To do so, they 
must have learned to solve algebraic equations and 
to represent and work with irrational numbers. Early 
middle grade students might solve problems with 
the Pythagorean theorem, but all problems should 
involve Pythagorean triples. A Pythagorean triple is 
a combination of whole-number side lengths that 
ﬁ t the Pythagorean theorem. For example, 3-4-5, 6-
8-10, and 5-12-13 are Pythagorean triples. Students 
might use an electronic spreadsheet to generate any 
number of Pythagorean triples. In later grades stu-
dents can explore the Pythagorean theorem and its 
applications using noninteger side lengths.

MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
Students can research several multicultural aspects of the 
Pythagorean theorem. Chinese mathematicians knew about 
the relationship of the side lengths of right triangles centu-
ries before Pythagoras. Egyptian and Babylonian architects 
had some knowledge of Pythagorean triples long before the 
time of Pythagoras.

ACTIVITY 17.31
 
Exploring the Pythagorean Theorem
Level: Grade 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Children develop the relationship of the Pythagorean 
theorem.
Materials: Scissors, glue sticks, Black-Line Masters 17.13 and 17.14
•  Pass out copies of Black-Line Master 17.13 (Pythagorean 
Puzzle a) and Black-Line Master 17.14 (Pythagorean 
Puzzle b) to each student.
•  Point out to students that the side lengths of the right 
triangle on each sheet are also side lengths of the differ-
ent squares.
•  For Black-Line Master 17.13 challenge students to cut up 
the pieces of both the a-square (side length a) and the b-
square (side length b) to form the c-square (side length c).
•  For Black-Line Master 17.14 challenge students to re-
arrange the cut-out pieces of the c-square (side length c) 
to form the a-square (side length a) and the b-square 
(side length b).
•  When students have correctly rearranged the pieces of 
the c-square to form the a-square and the b-square, they 
should glue the pieces in place.
•  Help groups to write the formula that develops from the 
relationship that the a-square plus the b-square equals the 
c-square (a2  b2  c2).

Materials: Paper, pencil, calculators
•  Post this list of triangle side lengths on the board.

c. 12, 13, 5
d. 8, 8, 10 
e. 10, 8, 6 
f. 8, 8, 8
•  Ask students whether they can tell which of them are 
right triangles by testing side lengths in the Pythagorean 
theorem. In the case of (8, 8, 8) students might recognize 
an equilateral triangle before applying the Pythagorean 
theorem to the three sides.
•  When students ﬁ nd a right triangle, they should draw the 
triangle using centimeters for units. Under their drawing 
they should show how the side lengths of the triangle ﬁ t 
the Pythagorean theorem.

All these activities provide opportunities for stu-
dents to communicate their knowledge of geome-
try and for teachers to assess them. By writing and 
drawing, either for display or in their journals, stu-
dents demonstrate what they have learned. A short 
interview with students can also be used to assess 
their understanding. According to the objectives ap-
propriate for each child, at each level, teachers can 
design appropriate assessment performance tasks. 
A kindergarten teacher can ask students to point to 
two or three examples of triangles, circles, squares, 
and rectangles from objects or pictures. A second- 
or third-grade teacher can ask students to describe 
shapes by the characteristics of sides and angles. 
A ﬁ fth- or sixth-grader can be asked to categorize 
quadrilaterals by various characteristics, such as 
parallel lines or lengths of diagonals. Short, focused 
interviews are good assessments because they al-
low students to demonstrate and explain rather than 
just answering on paper. During such interviews, the 
teacher can probe for the student’s understanding of 
various geometric concepts and relationships.

Dear Parents:
For the next two weeks, students in your child’s class are going to be working 
with geometry. Speciﬁ cally, they will be looking for symmetry, congruence 
and similarity, and tiling patterns. These concepts have already been studied 
in previous grades, but we are going to extend these ideas beyond what was 
learned earlier. You can help your child understand these concepts better by 
assisting with two projects.
Your child will have a set of tangram puzzle pieces for every adult and child 
over age 5 in your family. Please spend some time over the next few days 
working as a family with the tangram pieces. For example, see if you can use 
the seven pieces to make two squares that are the same size, two triangles 
that are the same size, and a square using all seven pieces. Using the puzzle 
pieces, your child will ﬁ nd examples of congruence (the shapes ﬁ t exactly on 
each other) and similarity (the shapes are the same but have different sizes). 
Discuss these concepts when examples occur while you work. Build symmet-
ric designs by drawing a line down the middle of a piece of paper, making a 
design along one side of the line, and having your child match your pieces on 
the opposite side of the line.
You may have a family quilt, rug, or other handcrafted item that has a re-
peated design. Talk about the history of the piece. Did a member of the family 
make it? a friend? Was it bought from the person who made it? As you sit with 
your child, each of you draws the design on paper and colors it in different 
ways. Talk about ways the pattern repeats. Are there examples of symmetry, 
congruence, similarity? Do geometric shapes, such as squares or triangles, 
cover the surface? If so, this is an example of tiling, or tessellation.
Can you ﬁ nd other examples of tessellation in your home? Hint: Is there ce-
ramic tile or linoleum in the kitchen or a bathroom?
After you have done some tangram activities and have made a design, have 
your child write two paragraphs in her or his journal to describe the work you 
have done together on each activity.
This chapter’s take-home material is a letter to 
parents and involves tangram pieces for geometry 
activities that can be done at home. A die-cut 
machine can make tangram pieces to take home. 

Summary
Geometry is one important way we see mathematics in 
everyday life: clothing and building design, art and ani-
mation, suitcase packing, and map reading. Visual infor-
mation constantly increases in our world. Spatial intelli-
gence has too often been neglected by schools because 
it seems to be a natural ability that children bring with 
them to school. Research shows that spatial intelligence 
can be developed by activities in and out of school. De-
velopment of spatial sense, or spatial visualization, is a 
major beneﬁ t of geometry experiences.
Geometric understanding has been described in 
ﬁ ve stages by van Hiele-Geldof and van Hiele. The ﬁ rst 
three stages provide guidance for the elementary school 
teacher in designing appropriate experiences. Children 
learn to recognize and label shapes before they can de-
scribe the attributes of each. In the upper elementary 
grades students begin to use attributes to describe and 
generalize about shapes and to understand the relation-
ships between plane and solid ﬁ gures.
A well-rounded elementary mathematics curriculum 
includes activities from four different geometry systems. 
Children learn about topological geometry by locating 
and describing the space they live in, using concepts 
such as proximity, enclosure, order, and separation. They 
learn about two- and three-dimensional shapes and ﬁ g-
ures in Euclidean geometry. As they make pictures and 
designs with triangles, circles, and squares, they learn 
the names and characteristics of plane shapes and 
three-dimensional (space) ﬁ gures and the relationships 
among these shapes and ﬁ gures. They also become fa-
miliar with geometric properties, such as congruence, 
similarity, and symmetry, that are common in several 
geometry systems and in real-life situations. In transfor-
mational geometry they learn that rotating, ﬂ ipping, and 
sliding shapes to new positions does not change their 
fundamental characteristics. As they work with coor-
dinate geometry, they ﬁ nd that the location of objects 
can be described using two-dimensional grids and that 
transformations can be explored and represented on 
coordinate grids. Extensions of these ideas allow inter-
mediate students to explore symmetry and similarity on 
coordinate grids. In grade 6 students begin their study of 
the Pythagorean theorem.
Learning about geometry provides a variety of ac-
tivities and content in the primary and intermediate 
mathematics classrooms. Many of the activities use real 
objects and geometry manipulatives. Geoboards, pen-
tominoes, tangrams, pattern blocks, cubes, Miras, and 
tiles are used to develop various concepts and terminol-
ogy from the four geometric systems. Take-home activi-
ties with tangrams and tessellations connect the geom-
etry done in school with home activities.
All the geometric systems are interrelated and es-
sential for developing the concepts and language of 
geometry.
Geometry is also foundational to many other topics 
in mathematics, such as fractions, measurement, and 
probability, as well as number systems and operations. 
Geometry activities connect mathematics to the art of 
many cultures and to history.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Many activities in geometry are excellent for discov-
ery and extension in a learning center. If task cards 
are available to you, look at the cards for geometry 
materials such as geoboards, pattern blocks, pen-
tominoes, or tangrams. Which mathematics objec-
tives in your state or school district curriculum are 
addressed in the task cards?
 2.  Children’s spatial visualization skills can be en-
hanced by many out-of-school activities, such as 
playing with Legos or jigsaw puzzles. Make a list of

Using Children’s Literature
Burns, Marilyn. (1995). The greedy triangle. New York: 
Scholastic. (Grades Pre-K– 3)
In The Greedy Triangle Marilyn Burns tells the story of 
a triangle who wishes to become more important by 
having more sides. As the triangle changes from shape 
to shape by adding new sides, it ﬁ nds that the changes 
are not fully satisfying. Eventually, the moral of “being 
who you are” is brought home. Both the changing of the 
shapes and the yearning to be somebody else will strike 
a chord with elementary students.
•  Read The Greedy Triangle to students.
•  As you read the story, hold up large cut-out shapes to 
match the text.
•  Have students draw or trace the various shapes into a 
shape book.
•  In their shape book, students can record the name of 
each shape.
•  Along with the name of the shape, students can write 
a story about each shape and how each shape has its 
own advantages and uses.
Sleator, William. (1998). The boy who reversed himself. 
New York: Dutton Publishing. (Grades 5– 7)
Read the storybook aloud to young students over 
several class days, have older students read the story by 
themselves.
•  Ask students what it means in the story if someone is 
“reversed.”
•  Ask how students could tell if a friend or family mem-
ber was reversed.
•  Ask what kinds of activities would remain unchanged 
if a person were reversed. What kinds of activities are 
impossible if a person is reversed?
•  Ask students to design a new activity that would now 
be possible if they themselves were reversed.

Computer Software
There are many geometry software programs for 
children to use. Turtle Math, developed by Douglas 
Clements and Julie Sarama Meredith and produced by 
Logo Computer Systems, is an adaptation of the com-
puter language Logo. Turtle Math provides entertaining 
and challenging activities for children to explore the 
geometry of the turtle’s world and their own. Students 
design the turtle’s path as it travels through mazes and 
toward various destinations.
 
Other software that focuses on geometry is the 
Geometer’s Sketchpad, a dynamic geometry program 
that allows students to explore geometric relationships 
by creating shapes and then moving and distorting 
them. A software similar to the Geometer’s Sketchpad is 
Cabri Geometry, which is also available in the TI-73 cal-
culator from Texas Instruments, a calculator designed 
for middle school students.

Developing 
and Extending 
Measurement 
Concepts
easurement is an everyday event that children encounter in 
many ways: weighing and taking temperatures at the 
doctor’s ofﬁ ce; measuring cloth, ribbon, or wire; buy-
ing lunch or paying for a movie; pouring water into a 
glass to mix a fruit drink; timing the baking of a cake; or 
checking the television schedule. By building on measurement 
experiences, children and teachers develop the mathematical concepts 
and skills needed to be thoughtful consumers and users of measurement. 
Helping children understand measurement systems requires their active 
involvement in realistic measuring activities through which they investigate 
concepts and develop skills using various measuring instruments and tools.
In this chapter you will read about:
1  The meaning and characteristics of measurement and two measuring 
processes
2  The characteristics of the metric system and the English (customary) 
system and advantages of the metric system over the English system

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Measurement activities begin in preschool as chil-
dren compare the length, area, capacity, and weight 
(mass) of familiar objects and containers. Group- 
and teacher-led activities continue for students 
throughout the grades to extend and deepen under-
standing of all areas of measurement. In addition 
to presenting examples of activities for children, in 
this chapter we include a discussion of the meaning 
of measurement, characteristics of the metric and 
English systems of measure, and a model for teach-
ing all types of measurement. As with other content 
chapters, this chapter follows the NCTM standards. 
The NCTM measurement standards for Pre-K– 2 are 
as follows:
NCTM Measurement Standard
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 
12 should enable all students to:
Understand measurable attributes of objects and the 
units, systems, and processes of measurement
Pre-K– 2 Expectations:
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  recognize the attributes of length, volume, weight, area, 
and time;
•  compare and order objects according to these attributes;
•  understand how to measure using nonstandard and stan-
dard units;
•  select an appropriate unit and tool for the attribute being 
measured.
Apply appropriate techniques, tools, and formulas to 
determine measurements.
Pre-K– 2 Expectations:
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  measure with multiple copies of units of the same size, 
such as paper clips laid end to end;
•  use repetition of a single unit to measure something 
larger than the unit, for instance, measuring the length 
of a room with a single meterstick;
•  use tools to measure;
•  develop common referents for measures to make com-
parisons and estimates.
Even before children learn to count, they exhibit a 
general idea about “more” and “less.” At an early age 
children listen to stories such as Goldilocks and the 
Three Bears and compare bear sizes of Papa Bear, 
Mama Bear, and Baby Bear. Young children are 
proud to report their age in years, even though they 
have not yet formed a concept of time. By counting 
apples, oranges, plastic chips, and other discrete, 
or countable, objects, children learn a more precise 
way to compare the sizes of sets and they develop 
the meaning of whole numbers. Similarly, measure-
ment concepts begin with general comparisons of 
a qualitative nature: One cookie is bigger than an-
other; one building is shorter than another; this is a 
heavier box, a slower car, a longer room, or a colder
day. However, these characteristics of length, vol-
ume, speed, and heat cannot be counted directly. 
They are continuous properties (continuous prop-
erties can be subdivided into progressively smaller 
and smaller units, such as time) that can take on an 
inﬁ nite number of values; in order to make quantita-
tive comparisons about them (how much shorter? 
how much colder?), they must be measured.
Continuous properties are measured by select-
ing an appropriate unit and comparing that unit to

the characteristic being measured. Through mea-
surement we associate numbers with the physical 
qualities of length, area, capacity, volume, angles, 
weight (mass), and temperature. Other measured 
characteristics have no physical properties. A clock 
measures the passage of a nontangible characteris-
tic—time. Money is a measure of value or worth or 
exchange. The units chosen for time are based on 
astronomical observation, and those for money are 
based on social and economic conventions.
Direct and Indirect Measurement
Measurement uses a direct or an indirect process. 
Direct measurement can be used for length, area, 
capacity (volume), and weight by applying a unit 
directly to the object being measured. The length 
of a desk can be measured by lining up pencils, 
ice cream sticks, or paper clips along its edge. 
The capacity of a jar can be measured by count -
ing the number of spoonfuls of salt or the number 
of smaller jars of water it takes to ﬁ ll it. Units of mea-
sure that are applied directly possess the same at-
tribute as the object being measured. Indirect mea-
surement refers to processes that determine the 
measure of an object by nondirect means, for ex-
ample, ﬁ nding the height of a pole by using shadows 
or trigonometry.
Measuring Processes
Linear measurement tools, such as rulers, yardsticks, 
and metersticks, have the attribute of length and are 
used to measure the characteristic of length (also 
called height, width, depth, or distance). A yard-
stick can be laid end to end 100 times to verify the 
length of a football ﬁ eld. Area has two dimensions, 
length and width; it is measured using units also 
having two dimensions, such as square inches and 
square meters. The area of a desktop can be mea-
sured by covering the top with tiles or square-inch 
cards. The school play area can be painted with 
squares (length and width) for playing four-square 
games. After squeezing 100 apples in a cider press, 
the volume of cider can be determined by ﬁ lling and 
emptying a cup until all the cider has been poured 
out; the liquid volume of cider is then expressed as 
the number of cups counted. On a two-arm pan bal-
ance, the weight (mass) of a book in one pan is de-
termined by placing unit weights in the other pan. 
When the pans balance, the weight of the book is 
equal to the total of all the weights on the other side. 
In each situation a measurement is made with units 
that have the same characteristic as the object being 
measured.
Younger children compare the lengths of two ob-
jects by lining them up side by side. Such a direct 
comparison of their lengths will enable young chil-
dren to determine the longer object. Of course, it is 
not always possible to align the two objects for such 
a comparison. If this is the case, younger students 
will use the concept of transitivity (transferring the 
measurement characteristic of an object to another 
object in order to make a comparison) to determine 
which object is the longer object. For example, if stu-
dents want to compare the widths of two windows, 
they might cut a piece of string or paper tape to the 
width of the ﬁ rst window. They then compare the 
length of the string to the width of the second win-
dow. Students can then determine whether or not 
the second window is wider than the ﬁ rst window. 
In this case the width of the ﬁ rst window is trans-
ferred to the length of the string, and then the length 
of string is compared to the width of the second 
window. An example of transitivity can be found in 
amusement parks. Some rides have height restric-
tions. A pole marked at 48 inches determines who 
may enter the ride. The height of the shortest accept-
able rider is transferred to the pole. The pole is then 
used to determine who may or may not enter the 
ride. Lobstermen use a measuring gauge to deter-
mine whether a lobster is the legal size. The gauge 
is applied to the body section of the lobster. If the 
lobster body is shorter than the gauge, the lobster is 
thrown back into the ocean.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
In direct measurement, applying a unit of mea-
sure one or more times to an object being measured 
is referred to as iteration. The yardstick is applied, 
or iterated, 100 times along the length of the football 
ﬁ eld. The tiles or cards are iterated on the top of the 
desk, the cup is iterated in the cider, and the ounce 
weights are iterated to determine the weight of the 
book. The units can be large or small, but the process 
of iteration is always present in direct measure.
Even if students measure the length of an object 
with multiple units, such as lining up paper clips, this 
is still a form of iteration. With conventional measur-
ing tools the iteration process is built into the tool. 
On a yardstick the iteration of 3 feet and of 36 inches 
is marked on the rule. The meterstick has decimeter 
and centimeter divisions. Weights often come in 10-
gram, 50-gram, 100-gram, 250-gram, and 500-gram 
units that can be used in differing combinations, in-
stead of using 1-gram units again and again.
Time and temperature cannot be measured di-
rectly; they require instruments that indirectly trans-
late evidence of their presence into a measurable 
form. Indirect measurement of time is based on as-
tronomical deﬁ nitions of year, month, day, hour, and 
minute. Modern clocks show the passage of time in 
synchronicity with standard time maintained by 
astronomers in Greenwich, England, at the United 
States Naval Observatory, and at the U.S. National 
Institute of Standards and Technology. Temperature 
is also measured indirectly. Some weather ther-
mometers have a number scale aligned with a tube 
that contains a liquid. Warm temperatures cause the 
liquid to expand and rise in the tube; cool tempera-
tures cause it to contract and drop in the tube. The 
temperature is determined by looking at the scale 
and reading the numeral at the top of the liquid in 
the tube. Other thermometers have springs that ex-
pand and contract with the gain or loss of heat, mov-
ing a needle on the face of the thermometer. Body 
temperature is measured electronically by reading 
the heat in the ear canal.
Weight (mass) can be measured directly, as with 
a pan balance, but is more often measured indi-
rectly. The ordinary home scale is actually a spring 
mechanism or electronic sensor calibrated to regis-
ter pressure. The reading on the scale displays the 
weight that would be equivalent to a certain pres-
sure. Electronic measuring devices are indirect 
measuring processes that substitute for direct mea-
suring processes.
What Teachers Should Know 
About Teaching Measurement
The study of measurement begins with developing 
in children a foundational understanding of the vari-
ous attributes that can be measured. Children de-
velop personal benchmarks for measurement units 
before they convert from one unit to another. Only 
after children understand such concepts as perime-
ter, area, and volume can they begin to explore and 
apply formulas for computing them.
The concept of measurement involves two types 
of data: discrete and continuous. Counting or mea-
suring discrete data is not challenging for children, 
but measuring continuous data is. Children who can 
iterate an inch to determine that the length of a pen-
cil is 6 inches long may have difﬁ culty determining 
the length of a pencil using a ruler, even with mark-
ings on it. In this case the data are now continuous, 
with no unit or iteration marks on the pencil. Simi-
larly, area is usually a discrete data collection. Even 
with side lengths of a rectangle clearly marked, the 
notion of square units representing the area of the 
rectangle is really continuous data because the units 
are not individually represented. Time and careful 
development are needed for children to bridge the 
gap between their natural ability to count discrete 
measurement units and the sophistication to deal 
with continuous measurement data. The activities 
in this chapter provide examples of the types of ex-
periences that will prepare children to work with 
continuous units.
Approximation, Precision, and Accuracy
Approximation. When objects in a set are counted, 
the number is exact: 1 or 13 or 145. When an object 
is measured, however, the measurement is approxi-
mate. The length of the table may be a little more 
or less than 13 pencils, almost 115 paper clips, or 
about 2 yards. The fact that measurement is always 
approximate stems from the nature of measurement 
and measurement units. At least theoretically, for 
any unit of measurement chosen, another smaller 
unit exists.
Counting the smaller units of measure yields a 
more precise measure for an object. For example, 
the height of a door measured with a meterstick 
might be more than 2 meters. If a decimeter is used 
to measure the door, the result might be a little more 
than 22 decimeters. Using a centimeter as the unit 

 
Chapter 18 Developing and Extending Measurement Concepts 
441
might show a measure of more than 222 cm but less 
than 223 cm. If it were practical to measure with mil-
limeter units, the door might be a little more than 
2,226 millimeters.
Each subsequent measurement is more precise, 
but the precision can be improved indeﬁ nitely 
(theoretically, if not practically) by measuring with 
smaller, still more precise units. Even if the mea-
surement appears to be exact, we recognize that it 
is not. Saying “exactly 12 o’clock” or “A football ﬁ eld 
is exactly 100 yards long” is misleading. While you 
were saying 12:00, the time had already changed. 
A marked football ﬁ eld is approximately 100 yards 
long, rather than exactly 100 yards long. It may be 1 
inch shorter or 1 inch longer than 100 yards.
Precision and Accuracy. The difference between 
precision and accuracy is important. Precision re-
fers to units of measure. Inches are more precise 
than feet or yards. Milliliters are more precise than 
liters. Accuracy refers to the care with which a mea-
surement is made. If the ﬁ nish line for a 100-meter 
dash is only 99.8 meters from the start line, then the 
measurement is not accurate. An inaccuracy of this 
sort would negate records set on the track.
The need for precision and accuracy depends on 
the measurement setting. Ball bearings for the U.S. 
space program must be manufactured to a tolerance 
of 0.00001 centimeter. Cutting cloth for a shirt does 
not require the same accuracy, but miscutting by an 
inch can have serious results in ﬁ tting the shirt. An 
optician who measures the bifocal line inaccurately 
will prepare glasses unsuited for the user. Household 
measuring cups and spoons are precise enough for 
cooking but not for chemical and pharmaceutical 
purposes. Measuring four cups of ﬂ our rather than 
three, however, may ruin the cake. Human error 
contributes to inaccuracy in measurement—from 
wrongly lining up the tool, to misreading the result, 
to recording it incorrectly. The carpenter’s adage 
“measure twice, cut once” is good advice for all 
measurement.

During the study of common fractions, students use 
number lines to develop an intuitive understand-
ing that there is no smallest fraction. How could a 
teacher relate knowledge of fractions to an under-
standing of approximation resulting from smaller 
and smaller units of measure? •••
E
Selecting Appropriate Units and Tools
Choosing the unit that has the best balance of pre-
cision, accuracy, and ease of use is an important 
measurement skill. Measuring a football ﬁ eld with a 
yardstick would be tedious and subject to substantial 
error. Accurate and easy-to-use electronic and laser 
measuring devices have been developed to replace 
many mechanical devices. An electronic device will 
give a more accurate and precise measure of a foot-
ball ﬁ eld than a yardstick; therefore it is more appro-
priate, when available. Such a device may measure 
the ﬁ eld as 3,595.72 inches, indicating that the ﬁ eld 
needs to be lengthened by approximately 4.28 inches. 
A football ﬁ eld is measured in yards, but yards are 
not an appropriate unit to measure the wingspan of 
a hummingbird, where even inches are too large for 
the task. A 500-gram mass eliminates the tedium of 
measuring apples with 500 1-gram weights; weighing 
a grape with a 500-gram mass would not be sensible. 
Measuring a door height with 2,226 separate millime-
ter units is not practical. A meterstick marked in mil-
limeters is more efﬁ cient.
Understanding that all measurements are approximations 
is a difﬁ cult, but important concept for students. (National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000, p. 46)
Divisions on a meterstick indicating decimeters, 
centimeters, and millimeters allow measurement 
without iterating the smaller units and increasing hu-
man error. However, measuring the door may not be 
necessary at all. If you were covering a typical class-
room door with craft paper, you would measure and 
cut about 2.5 meters of paper, enough to cover the 
surface. Selection of the unit and accuracy of mea-
surement are subject to the demands of the task.

riod of time. Units of measure were originally derived 
from common usage, such as the distance from an 
adult’s nose to the ﬁ ngertip on an outstretched arm 
(yard), grains of barley laid end to end (inch), stones 
(weight), and the distance a horse could pull a plow 
before needing to rest (a furlong—still used in horse 
racing).
The difﬁ culty inherent in trying to use two different measure-
ment systems was exempliﬁ ed by the crash of the Martian 
Climate Orbiter. The loss of the $125 million spacecraft was 
due to miscommunication between the contractor and NASA. 
The contractor used English units, and NASA mistakenly as-
sumed the units were metric.
The English, or customary, system of measure-
ment has been used in the United States since the 
country’s earliest years, brought from England by 
the original colonial settlers. Periodic efforts to con-
vert to the metric system have been largely unsuc-
cessful. Thomas Jefferson recommended adoption 
of the metric system in the early 1800s. The U.S. Con-
gress made the system legal in 1866, and President 
Gerald Ford signed a voluntary Metric Conversion 
Act in 1975. Although the public has resisted use of 
the metric system, the metric system is now widely 
used in science, industry, and some areas of govern-
ment. In recent years the U.S. government has stipu-
lated that all suppliers to the military must produce 
tools, machinery, and armaments in metric units, 
not English units. Despite such advances, the Eng-
lish system is entrenched in most everyday uses in 
the United States. Thus children need to learn both 
the English and metric systems.
The length of a yard was established by King Henry I of 
England (1069– 1131) as the distance from the tip of his out-
stretched hand to the tip of the royal nose. In the following 
years, the length of a yard ﬂ uctuated according to the stature 
of the king. Eventually, Henry VII established the length of 
the yard as 3 feet and had a standard yard inscribed on a 
brass rod.
In earlier days measurements varied according 
to the size of a person’s hand or pace, but standard 
units have since been established, so that inches, 
cups, and pounds are now the same wherever they 
are used. However, no common relationship exists 
between units for each characteristic being mea-
sured (12 inches equals 1 foot, 3 feet equals 1 yard, 
and 1,760 yards equals 1 mile) and from one mea-
surement characteristic to another (between length 
and capacity, for example). Tables 18.1 to 18.4 pres-
ent common English units of measure for length, 
area, capacity (volume), and weight (mass) and 
show that the system lacks consistent relationship 
among units.
The Metric System. In contrast to the English sys-
tem, the metric system was created in a systematic 
way during a relatively short span of time in the 
late 18th century. In 1790, the National Assembly of 
France directed the French Academy of Sciences 
“to deduce an invariable standard for all the mea-

sures and all the weights” (Johnson & Norris, 2006). 
The French National Assembly wanted a new sys-
tem of measurement to do away with all vestiges of 
the recently overthrown monarchy. All the old mea-
surement units were tainted by association with the 
old regime and had to be replaced. The Academy 
derived its basic unit of length by calculating the dis-
tance from the equator to the North Pole and then 
used one ten-millionth of the distance as the length 
of a meter.
The idea for a metric system of measurement was ﬁ rst pro-
posed by Simon Stevin (1548– 1620).
Base units for area, capacity, and weight were 
established at the same time as the meter (m) and 
were derived from the meter and its subdivisions. 
Area is measured in square centimeters and square 
meters, and volume (capacity) in cubic centimeters, 
cubic decimeters, and cubic meters. The base unit 
for land area is the are (pronounced “air”), mea-
suring 100 square meters (10 m by 10 m). A hect-
are (ha) is 100 ares. Volume is measured in cubic 
centimeters (cm3) and cubic meters (m3). One cubic 
centimeter of water at 4 Celsius (the temperature at 
which water is most dense) is 1 gram, a basic metric 
unit of weight. Originally, a prototype, or standard, 
rod with a length of 1 meter was made from plati-
num and was stored in a sterile environment under 
constant temperature and humidity. Today, a meter 
is deﬁ ned as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-
red line of the krypton-86 atom. Only the kilogram is 
still based on a physical object—a platinum-iridium 
solid weighing 1 kilogram kept at the International 
Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres, France. 
Tables 18.5 to 18.8 show commonly used units of 
measure in the metric system.
One signiﬁ cant characteristic of the metric sys-
tem has already been mentioned: the measures of 
area, capacity, and weight are all derived from the 
unit for length. Another important feature is its deci-
mal system; larger and smaller units are multiples of 
10 or divisions by 10 of the base units. This connec-
tion to the Hindu-Arabic numeration system helps 
children develop their understanding of the metric 
system. Table 18.9 illustrates this attribute through 
the equivalence of the various units of measure for 
length.
The metric system has several advantages over 
the English system:
•  It is similar to the base-10 system of numeration.
•  It is simple and easy to use.
•  Only a few units of measure are commonly 
used—meter, gram, liter. Most people only 
need to know one or two units for each type of 
measurement.
•  A uniform set of preﬁ xes applies to units of mea-
sure in each area of measurement. Greek preﬁ xes 
are used for units that are multiples of the basic 
unit (kilo  1,000, hecto  100, deca  10). Latin 
preﬁ xes are used for units that are divisions of the 
basic unit (milli 

Once students learn 
and understand the met-
ric preﬁ xes, they can use 
them regardless of the 
measurement characteris-
tic. Thus in Table 18.9 the 
measurement unit gram
or liter can replace the 
length unit meter, and the 
result is two tables of all 
the metric units for weight 
and capacity.
The units of measure 
shown in Tables 18.1 
through 18.8 are com-
monly used units and, in 
addition to units for time, 
money, temperature, and 
angular measure, are appropriate for study in ele-
mentary school.

A Teaching/Learning Model 
for Measurement
With each type of measurement system children 
should have a variety of experiences that help them 
to understand the concept of measurement and be-
E
come skilled with measurement tools and appropri-
ate units. Measurement activities in the early part 
of this chapter represent a teaching approach and 
sequence to measurement; they are intended to 
develop measurement concepts. As teachers work 
with younger children, it is useful to see how activi-
ties ﬁ t together and support the long-range instruc-
tional goals and objectives; thus a graphic organizer 
for measurement activities is presented in Figure 
18.1. The sequence for introducing measurements 
concepts to children is as follows:
•  Building understanding of the characteristic be-
ing measured and its use in everyday life
•  Using nonstandard units with exploratory 
measurements
•  Using standard units in both the English and met-
ric systems, with tools focusing on determining 
and recording measurements
•  Developing mental models for common 
measures
•  Estimating measurements using mental models
•  Engaging in projects and activities that require 
measurement skills
•  Looking for patterns and relationships that lead to 
formulas for speciﬁ c measures
This sequence of measurement activities connects 
concepts of whole numbers, fractional numbers, 
geometry and spatial reasoning, and patterns and 
relationships for algebraic thinking.
Work with measurement is spread over all the 
school years. Early work is largely inventive and 
MISCONCEPTION
When students study 
the metric system, they 
often learn to multiply 
or divide by powers of 
10 to convert metric 
measures. Some develop 
the mistaken rule that 
when converting from a 
smaller unit to a larger 
one, the correct process 
is to multiply. For example 
to change 25 centimeters 
to meters, some students 
would multiply by 100 
rather than divide. (Later 
in this chapter we suggest 
other strategies to solve 
an example like this one.)

investigative by nature. Children in preschool, kin-
dergarten, and primary grades begin with activities 
to establish the everyday contexts for measurement 
and to introduce measurement with nonstandard 
units. Students who conserve length, area, and vol-
ume understand that these concepts do not change, 
even when an object’s position or appearance is 
altered. Students who cannot conserve length, for 
example, will think a yardstick is one length in a 
horizontal position and a different length when it 
is rotated to a vertical position. They do not think 
that the yardstick conserves or maintains the same 
length in all positions.
Children generally begin to conserve length and 
area when they are 8 or 9 years old. The ability to 
conserve is part of the maturation process and need 
not be explicitly taught. Teachers who work with 
nonconservers or preconservers should not be sur-
prised at children’s inconsistent use of instruments 
and units. However, the fact that students are not 
conservers should not prevent them from engaging 
in many activities that provide the foundation for 
understanding measurement. These early experi-
ences will allow them to learn that the pencil has 
a ﬁ xed length whether it is horizontal or vertical or 
that the jar has a ﬁ xed capacity even though it can 
be ﬁ lled by 20 small bottles or by 10 medium-
size ones. Teachers can create many situations 
for students to recognize ways in which they use 
measurement.
•  A classroom height chart provides opportunities 
to discuss and compare heights throughout the 
year.
•  A bucket of square ceramic or plastic tiles, or 
squares cut from index cards, can provide oppor-
tunities for covering desktops, books, and other 
surfaces.
•  A sand table or plastic tub full of packing peanuts 
or inert packing granules with variously sized 
containers and measures invites comparison of 
volumes by ﬁ lling and pouring from one con-
tainer to another.
•  Work with clay or plasticine allows children to 
feel both the volume and the mass of clay.
•  A daily schedule and the calendar are discussed 
in terms of starting times, ending times, and time 
between events or time until another event.
•  Checking daily temperatures helps children 
connect the descriptive and predictive nature of 
weather to reading thermometers.
•  The teacher can ask students and parents to look 
for examples of measurement outside school.
These and many other real-life connections help stu-
dents build meaning about measurement.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Activity 18.1 illustrates measurement of length, 
area, capacity (volume), and weight suitable for the 
developmental level of primary students, but the ac-
tivities can be adapted for older students who need 
additional experiences before formal instruction in 
measurement. Stations 2 and 4 focus on transitivity, 
and Stations 1 and 3 feature iteration. Station 1 ex-
plores capacity, Station 2, weight, Station 3, length, 
and Station 4, time. Three of the stations involve 
a qualitative comparison, where children look for 
which object is heavier, longer, or slower rather 
than how much heavier, how much longer, or how 
much slower. Thus the focus is on the attribute itself 
rather than on any numerical representation of the 
attribute.
Attention to the vocabulary of measurement is 
important. While children are working informally 
with measurement materials and activities, the 
teacher can use different vocabulary to express sim-
ilar measurement ideas. Measurement of length and 
distance is related to many questions: How long is it? 
How deep is it? How wide is it? How tall is it? How far 
is it from A to B? and so on.
Measurement of distance is sometimes expressed 
as elapsed time: It takes 30 minutes to travel from 
City A to Town B. Children need to build this concept 
by talking about start time, stop time, and time in 
between start and stop. Developing a ﬂ exible mea-
surement vocabulary is essential from these early 
explorations throughout the elementary grades.
Two activities on the companion website extend 
the measurement attributes considered in the four 
stations of Activity 18.1. “Drawing Straws” and “Com-
paring Mass in Sand Cans” provide children with the 
opportunity to compare lengths using straws and to 
compare weights (mass) using sand cans.
Activities to Develop 
Measurement Concepts 
and Skills
Nonstandard Units of Measure
Planned measurement activities frequently begin 
in primary grades, even though not all children are 
conservers. Once begun, measurement work and 
lessons continue throughout the elementary school 
years. Activities with nonstandard units bridge the 
gap between exploratory work and the introduction 
of standard units. Two goals for work with nonstan-
dard units are to help children recognize the need 
for a uniform set of measures and to lay the ground-
work for their understanding of the various units of 
standard measure.
Activities with nonstandard measurement pro-
vide experiences dealing with linear, area, capacity, 
and weight (mass) measures. Measuring the length 
of an object using dowel sticks, cardboard strips cut 
in uniform lengths, or other nonstandard units helps 
Research for the Classroom
•
Recent research has added to our knowledge of how 
young children master measurement concepts. Some 
elementary school mathematics texts suggest using itera-
tion to begin to develop students’ measurement concepts. 
One interesting ﬁ nding from a recent study is that it is 
transitivity of measurement that allows students to make 
comparisons based on their unit iterations (Reece & Kamii, 
2000b). With transitivity students “transfer” the length 
of an object to a second object, which is then used for 
comparisons to other objects. For example, the heights of 
two students are each “transferred” to the iterated units 
that students use. These two numbers of iterated units 
are compared to determine who is taller or shorter, and by 
how much. Furthermore, the number of iterated units may 
in and of itself be used to represent the student’s height 
(Reece & Kamii, 2000a).
 
A further ﬁ nding of a related research study was that 
most second-grade students can use transitivity with 
length measurements (Reece & Kamii, 2000a). However, 
not until grade 3 can a large majority of students use itera-
tion in length measurement. Iteration with volume (grade 
4) and time (grade 5) develops after length iteration (Reece 
& Kamii, 2000a). A recommendation from these ﬁ ndings 
is to provide younger children with measurement activities 
that focus on both transitivity and iteration measurement 
concepts and not on iteration alone.
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
Although rice, popping corn, or some other dried grains or 
legumes will perform well as a way to measure capacity, 
some students may object to what they see as a wasteful use 
of foodstuffs. It is important to be sensitive to such objec-
tions and to be prepared to use alternative materials, such as 
packaging peanuts, inert packing granules, or sand.

to establish the iteration measuring process. Paper 
strips, each cut to the student’s height, are used in 
Activity 18.2 to compare students’ heights. New pen-
cils are used in Activity 18.3. Students begin at one 
end, placing a pencil to line up with one end of the 
object they are measuring. They continue to line 
up pencils until the line of pencils is approximately 
equal to the length of the object. Then they count 
the pencils that they have laid out to determine the 
length of the object in pencil units. Later, they learn 
to use a single pencil and the iteration process.
The companion website activity “Which Unit Did 
You Use?” directs students to measure the length 
of speciﬁ c items using nonstandard units, such as

•  Children may choose to count and record the scoops 
needed to ﬁ ll each container to its mark, or you can sup-
ply a record sheet.
Station 2: Heavier and Lighter
Materials: A two-pan balance or other simple balance scale; pairs 
of objects such as a toy car and a wooden block; a chalkboard 
eraser and a small bag of rice; a small rubber ball and a box of 
pencils
•  The balance gives children opportunities to compare pairs 
of objects to determine heavier or lighter. In children’s ﬁ rst 
work with the beam balance, they learn to make the sides 
balance by putting objects in both pans until the crossbar 
is level. They also see the crossbar go down when the 
object in one pan is heavier.
•  Set out pairs of objects and ask students to compare 
their weights. Prepare a mat on which children can place 
objects as they work.
Station 3: Longer and Shorter
Materials: Three 10-centimeter rods from a Cuisenaire or base-10 
set with sticks to be measured. Cut wooden sticks so that some 
are longer and some are shorter than the rods; make a large mat 
with the headings “Longer Than 3” and “Shorter Than 3.”
•  Show how to line up the rods along the sticks, beginning 
at one end of a stick. Children “measure” the sticks and 
place them on the mat, putting those that are longer than 
3 rods on one side and those that are shorter than 3 rods 
on the other side.
•  Children may also ﬁ nd that they need a category of “Just 
about 3.”
Station 4: Which Is Slower?
Materials: Several cans with holes of varying sizes punched 
through the bottoms (avoid sharp edges); water or clean ﬁ ne-
grained sand in a plastic tub. Paint cans different colors, or paint a 
number on each.
•  Have a child select a can, ﬁ ll it, and hold it so the water 
or sand drains through the hole. (If sand is used, the child 
will need to gently shake the can to drain all of it.)
•  Ask questions as the children observe what happens: 
Does the red can drain quickly or slowly? Which can 
drains more slowly, the red can or the blue can? What is 
the color of the can that drains the fastest? Can you put 
the cans in order from quickest to slowest? What can you 
tell me about the size of the hole and the speed at which 
the can empties?

ACTIVITY 18.3
 
Pencil Measurement
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Student pairs
Objective: Students measure length using pencils as units.
Materials: New pencils
•  Give each pair of students 8 to 10 new graphite pencils.
•  Select an object such as a desktop to measure. Demon-
strate how to put pencils end to end to ﬁ nd the length 
and width of the desk in pencil units. Stress the impor-
tance of not leaving gaps between pencils or having 
pencils overlap.
•  Have students record their results, and post them for 
comparison. Discuss differences in measurement, and 
emphasize the approximate nature of measurement.
•  Use problem cards such as the following to direct 
children’s other length measurement activities.
Penciling
Use new pencils from the box to answer the following 
questions.
1.  How long is the reading table? How wide is the 
reading table?
2.  How wide is the door to the hallway?
3.  How high is the chalk tray?
4.  Can you ﬁ gure out a way to decide how high the 
desk is without measuring it? If you can, tell how 
high it is.
5.  Pick something else in the room, and measure its 
length, height, or depth.
6.  Sketch what you have measured, and label your 
sketches with the measurements. Write about your 
measurements in your journal.
pencils, crayons, and stirrers. They then compare 
the resulting number of units they needed and ex-
plore why the numbers vary according to the unit 
used. As children compare the number of units they 
use with the length of their measurement unit, they 
will begin to explore the principle of compensa-
tion. The principle of compensation stipulates that 
the smaller a measurement unit is, the more of these 
units are required to measure an attribute. For ex-
ample, if the length of a hallway is measured in me-
ters and in inches, the number of inches that mea-
sures the hallway length is larger than the number 
of meters (because an inch is shorter than a meter). 
Similarly, your weight in ounces is a larger number 
than your weight in pounds, or kilograms. Walnuts, 
blocks, and Uniﬁ x cubes serve as nonstandard units 
of weight in the companion website activity “Way 
to Weigh.” In the companion website activity “Fill It 
Up” students explore capacity by comparing the ca-
pacity of varied containers. The companion website 
activity “Foot by Foot” focuses on using children’s 
nonstandard personal foot lengths for measuring.

Problem cards are used in Activity 18.3 and in sev-
eral of the companion website activities to direct 
children’s activities with nonstandard units. Select 
a type of measurement—linear, weight, capacity, 
or area—and a nonstandard unit for it. Prepare a 
problem card to direct activities with your nonstan-
dard unit and measuring processes. •••

Standard Units of Measure
All the preceding activi-
ties will develop children’s 
sense of measurement 
both as a concept for qual-
ifying an attribute (length, 
weight, capacity) and as a 
process (iteration, trans-
ference). The activities 
also demonstrate the need 
for a standard unit so that 
any measured attribute 
can be easily understood 
and adapted to others.
To help children ex-
tend their understanding 
of standard units, they may 
ﬁ nd it helpful to establish 
personal benchmarks for 
some measurement units. 
They might use the weight 
of a bottle of soda as a benchmark for a pound, the 
span of a hand for half a foot, the width of a ﬁ n-
ger for an inch, or the distance from their chin to 
the ﬂ oor for a meter. Personal benchmarks such as 
these are essential for children to develop their es-
timation skills with measurement and to be able to 
recognize reasonable measurement data. Activity 
18.4 helps children establish personal benchmarks 
on their body for an inch and a foot and then tests 
their selection by measuring the length of an object 
using their personal unit. The companion website 
activity “Almost a Quarter of . . .” engages children 
in ﬁ nding objects that are approximately 
1
4 yard in 
length. They then measure the objects and compare 
the actual length to their estimated length. How Big 
Is a Foot?, featured in the Using Children’s Literature 
section at the end of this chapter, is the story of a 
queen’s bed. It is an interesting way to emphasize 
the need for a standard foot measure.
As noted, children need to learn both the metric 
and the English systems of measurement. They learn 
about measurement best when they have frequent 
opportunities to measure objects so that they can 
construct their understanding of units and measur-
ing processes. The time needed to learn both mea-
surement systems need not be extensive. Children 
who understand basic measurement concepts and 
who understand how to use the various instruments 
can apply their knowledge to situations, both real 
and contrived, in which measuring is involved.
The study of standard units of measure also of-
fers opportunities for children to broaden their un-
derstanding of other cultures. As indicated earlier, 
the United States is the only major country in the 
world that has not adopted the metric system of 
measure as its standard system. Children who be-
gan their schooling in another country may have 
some understanding of the metric system. They can 
share their knowledge of the system and some of 
In 1962, a group of students at MIT in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts, used a new nonstandard measure to determine 
the length of a bridge across the Charles River into Boston. 
They used the smoot. The smoot was the height of one of the 
students in the group, and they determined the length of the 
bridge in smoots by iterating Oliver R. Smoot Jr. across the 
bridge. Painted markings on the Harvard Bridge commemo-
rate the smoot measurement unit.
ACTIVITY 18.4
 
When Is a Foot a Foot?
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Individual
Objective: Students ﬁ nd lengths on their body to serve as approxi-
mations of 1 inch and 1 foot.
Materials: Rulers with inch markings
•  Pass out rulers to students.
•  Show students that the second knuckle of your index 
ﬁ nger is a good approximation for an inch.
•  Ask students to ﬁ nd two body measurements that ap-
proximate an inch and a foot.
•  Have students use their two body measurements to ﬁ nd 
the width of their desk (inch unit) and the length of the 
chalkboard (foot unit).
•  Have students record their data and then measure both 
lengths using the ruler to check their accuracy.

the ways they learned to use it in their homelands. 
At the same time, children with knowledge of the 
English system can share it with classmates.
Rote exercises in which children convert Eng-
lish to metric units and metric to English units are 
not meaningful ways to develop their understand-
ing of measurement concepts or systems. Accord-
ing to NCTM, such activities should be avoided with 
younger children and are of dubious beneﬁ t for 
older ones; teachers should avoid extended atten-
tion to exact conversions between the two systems. 
However, benchmark relationships between the two 
systems are useful to know, and over time children 
need opportunities to develop them. Common rela-
tionships or benchmarks children can develop dur-
ing measurement activities are these:
•  One meter is slightly more than 1 yard. One yard 
is slightly less than 1 meter.
•  Two centimeters are a little less than 1 inch. One 
inch is a little more than 2 centimeters.
•  One kilogram is a little more than 2 pounds. One 
pound is a little less than one-half of a kilogram.
•  One liter is slightly more than 1 quart. One quart 
is slightly less than 1 liter.
Learning centers are useful settings for many 
measurement activities. Set up a center with objects 
to be measured and instruments for measuring for 
length, area, volume (capacity), and weight (mass). 
Problem cards can be used as a way to direct work 
at the stations. Many of the activities in this chapter 
are designed for learning centers.
Teaching Children How 
to Measure Length
Building on their experiences with nonstandard 
measures, children are ready to begin work with a 
ruler. Children’s ﬁ rst ruler should be one that has no 
marks along the edge; pine molding cut to lengths 
of 1 foot, 1 yard, or 1 meter serves nicely. Some-
times standard yardsticks or metersticks have divi-
sions and numerals printed only on one side. These 
can be turned over to the blank side and used as 
described in what follows. Prepare problem cards 
to direct students’ work as they measure the length 
and width of a desk, the distance from a classroom 
door to the teacher’s desk, 
or the distance between 
the classroom door and 
the principal’s ofﬁ ce. Re-
corded distances can be 
phrased such as “longer 
than 12 sticks and shorter 
than 13 sticks” or “about 
13 sticks.” Introducing ap-
proximate measures such 
as these can help children deal with measurements 
that are not a whole number of units.
Perimeters
Perimeter is the measure of the distance around a 
closed ﬁ gure and is an extension of length measure-
ment. In practical terms, perimeter is used to deter-
mine the amount of ribbon needed for the border on 
a place mat or bedspread and the amount of fencing 
needed to enclose a backyard swimming pool. Ex-
ercises dealing with realistic situations give children 
practical experiences that help them to determine 
perimeters and to distinguish perimeter from area 
measures.
Children can use Cuisenaire rods, trains of Uniﬁ x 
cubes, or centimeter rulers to ﬁ nd the perimeters of 
such things as picture and window frames, pillow 
covers with lace trimming, and other objects that 
have wooden, cloth, and paint trims (Figure 18.2). 
Older children can also use metric tape measures 
or trundle wheels to determine perimeters of class-

MISCONCEPTION
Younger children some-
times try to ﬁ t the object 
to the length of a measur-
ing unit. For example, a 
child who is measuring a 
shoe that is shorter than 
a foot might say, “I need 
more shoe.”

Big Foot (Communication)
Level: Grades 1– 4
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students trace their foot on graph paper and approxi-
mate the area of the outline.
Materials: Graph paper
•  Pass out graph paper to students in groups.
•  Have students help each other trace their footprint on the 
graph paper.
•  Have students count the number of squares that their 
footprint covers. They can keep track of the squares that 
have been counted by coloring them as they count.
•  Allow student groups to decide how to deal with squares 
that are partially covered by a footprint.
•  Have students record their data on their footprint, and 
post the footprints on the classroom wall.
•  Have student volunteers explain how they solved the 
problem of the partially covered squares (counted only 
whole squares? counted only those at least half covered? 
tried to combine partially covered squares to make whole 
squares?).
rooms, playground areas, and larger regions. Con-
nections between mathematics and everyday life 
become evident as children engage in projects in 
which they, for example, determine the perimeter 
of a picture in order to put a border around it and 
investigate the cost of the chain-link fence that en-
closes a play area or the school grounds.
The perimeter of plane ﬁ gures is determined by 
ﬁ nding the measure of each side and adding their 
lengths (Figure 18.3). Students can measure the side 
lengths of various everyday objects such as books, 
posters, and placemats. See the companion website 
activity “Walking Around,” in which students pace 
off the perimeter of shapes taped on the classroom 
ﬂ oor.
of perimeter activities, older students better under-
stand formulas for perimeters of common objects:
Perimeter of a square:

Perimeter of a rectangle: 
p  l  w  l  w  2  l  2  w  2l  2w
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle: 
p  s  s  s  3  s  3s
E X E RC I S E
Draw two polygons, and label each of their sides 
with letters. Estimate the perimeter of each shape 
in inches or centimeters. Write a formula for the 
perimeter of the two shapes. Measure each of the 
sides, and calculate the perimeter. How accurate 
were your estimates? •••
Teaching Children About 
Measuring Area
Intuitive concepts of area are developed when chil-
dren cover index cards with colored squares or 
gummed stickers. Such an experience builds chil-
dren’s understanding of area as a covering, in con-
trast to linear measures. They also experiment with 
different shapes to cover a ﬁ gure, such as circles or 
irregular ﬁ gures. They discover that using shapes 
such as circles is not effective because of the gaps be-
tween them. Thus they gain an intuitive understand-
ing for using square units to determine area. Activity 
18.5 uses children’s footprints to measure area.

Tables and Chairs (Communication)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students build models of tables with their tiles.
Materials: 5 tiles (10 square), 1
4-inch graph paper
•  Pass out materials to students.
•  Show one tile to students, and suggest that this tile is the 
model of a table where only one person can sit at each 
side.
•  Have students put two tiles together as 
shown here, and ask how many people 
can sit at this long table. (Answer: 6.)
•  The challenge for groups is to use four tiles to model all 
possible table arrangements. Each table must share at 
least one full side with another table.
•  Students should keep track of all their tables in a chart 
such as this:
 
Drawing of  
Number of People Who
 Table Arrangement 
Can Sit at the Table
•  After students have collected their data, ask if the same 
number of tables always seats the same number of 
people.
•  Without using the vocabulary of area and perimeter, help 
children to observe that although they are using four 
tables for each setting, the number of people who can sit 
at their tables varies, but the number of tables does not.
•  Repeat with all ﬁ ve tiles.
Older children use area measures to answer the 
following questions:
•  How many square inches of paper are needed to 
cover the bottom of our bird’s cage?
•  How much paint do we need to put a “sky” on the 
background prop for our play?
•  How many pounds of fertilizer are needed to give 
a fall feeding to the school’s grassy areas?
•  What will it cost to have the classroom carpet 
cleaned if the price is 75 cents per square foot?
Many children at all grade levels in elementary 
school confuse area and perimeter. Activity 18.6 
provides an exploration for children that compares 
area and perimeter using tables and chairs. In the 
activity children observe that any arrangement of 
four tables will not service the same number of 
chairs.
E X E RC I S E
How do you remember the difference between pe-
rimeter and area? •••
Teaching Children About 
Measuring Capacity and Volume
Many real-life questions are related to capacity and 
volume measurement:
E
•  How much does this jar hold?
•  How much sugar do I need?
•  What is the dosage of this medicine?
•  How full is the cup?
•  How much can I pack in this suitcase?
•  Will the milk left in the carton ﬁ t into my glass?
•  Which refrigerator will hold more?
Capacity and volume are two ways of thinking 
about and expressing the same characteristic in 
measurement. Capacity measures have been es-
tablished for products such as liquids measured in 
cups, pints, quarts, and liters. Measurement of both 
liquid and dry ingredients with teaspoons, table-
spoons, and cups is common in cooking. Capac-
ity is measured in milliliters and liters in the metric 
system. Volume measures are derived from length 
measurements such as cubic inches and cubic feet 
in the English system and cubic centimeters and cu-
bic meters in the metric system. Capacity refers to 
the amount that a container will hold. Volume can 
also refer to the amount that an object will hold, but 
it also refers to the size of the object, for example, 
the volume of a large boulder. In the metric system 
a direct relationship exists between volume and ca-
pacity units; a cubic centimeter is also a milliliter, 
and a cubic decimeter is a liter. Cups, pints, quarts, 
and gallons have no direct relationship to linear 
measures in the English system. The measure of a

cup is unrelated to the length of a foot, and a ﬂ uid 
ounce has no connection to the weight unit ounce.
Younger children enjoy ﬁ lling one container with 
the contents of another. They might try to guess if 
the contents of one container will ﬁ t into another, or 
how many times the contents of a smaller container 
will ﬁ t into a larger one. The activities for younger 
children are similar to those outlined in Activity 18.1. 
Children compare capacities and rank them in order 
of magnitude, but all such comparisons are qualita-
tive, with little focus on numerical presentations of 
volume or capacity.
Teaching Children About 
Measuring Weight (Mass)
As with the other attributes, younger children in-
formally explore the attribute of weight, by holding 
an object in each hand. They can judge which one 
is lighter by using a simple pan balance. They can 
use nonstandard units, such as buttons or coins, to 
weigh objects using balance scales (see Activity 
18.1, Station 2). Experiences with balance scales 
can help children understand the balance aspect of 
equations.
Children at this age (K– 2) do not need to con-
sider the difference between weight and mass. (We 
discuss the differences later in the chapter.) The 
focus for young children is on building a sensory 
understanding of weight and making qualitative 
comparisons using their bodies and simple balance 
scales.
Teaching Children About 
Measuring Angles
Measurement of angles is often considered a geom-
etry topic, appropriate for the higher grades. How-
ever, the concept of an angle can be developed in 
primary grades before the introduction of degrees 
and protractors for measuring them. As children 
learn to tell time, they can form “human” clock faces 
with a child standing at each numeral on a circle 
and others acting as clock hands, moving from nu-
meral to numeral. The angles formed by the human 
clock (Figure 18.4) and any demonstration clock 
informally introduce angles. Children can talk about 
the minute hand at quarter-, half-, and three-quarter 
hours and whether the hour and minute hands are 
close together or far apart. Children can also use 
their index and middle ﬁ ngers to form different 
angles.
Students explore angles by turning themselves 
around during physical education games or music 
and dance. As they make a full turn, a half-turn, 
and a quarter-turn, they develop their spatial sense 
of angles. The concept of turns and angles is em-
bedded in geometry activities with materials such 
as pattern blocks, tangrams, and tessellations (see 
Chapter 17).
Young children also learn about squares, rect-
angles, and triangles, which have combinations of 
right, obtuse, and acute angles. While studying these 
ﬁ gures, children demonstrate the different angles 
with their arms and draw them on paper. As students 
work with pattern blocks and tangrams, they notice 
the angles and which ones are the same or com-
bine to make a larger angle. Children compare and 
label the angles with their own words (corner angle, 
little angle, big angle). The terms right, acute, and 
obtuse angles and the number of degrees in each 
type may not be introduced in the early grades, but 
gradually they are used in naming and comparing 
angles. In the companion website activity “Catego-
rizing Angles” students use the corner of a ﬁ le card 
to identify right, acute, and obtuse angles.
Figure 18.4 Children demonstrate angles as a human
clock.

ACTIVITY 18.7
 
Temperature (Connections)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Individual
Objective: Compare temperatures of surfaces using sense of 
touch.
Materials: None
•  A sunny day provides a setting for an investigation and 
discussion about temperature. Choose an outside location 
where there is a sidewalk, some grass, and a patch of dry 
ground, and select a time when one part of each location 
is in sunlight and another part is in shade.
•  Have the children remove their shoes and socks and walk 
on the sunny sidewalk. Talk about how it feels. Have them 
walk on the shady sidewalk, and compare its feel with 
that of the sunny sidewalk.
•  Have the children walk on the sunny and shady portions 
of the other surfaces. Discuss differences in tempera-
ture, if any, between each spot and the others. Can the 
children order three or four locations from warmest to 
coolest?
Teaching Children About 
Measuring Temperature
Children have had many experiences with tempera-
ture; hot is one of the ﬁ rst cautionary words to tod-
dlers. Children recognize differences in activities 
and clothes related to outdoor and indoor tempera-
tures and seasonal variations. Everyday experiences 
serve as a basis for introducing measurement of 
temperature. In Activity 18.7 children feel tempera-
tures on different outdoor surfaces in sun and shade. 
A drawing or journal-writing activity might prompt 
children to recall the hottest and coldest days of 
their lives, and activities they enjoy most in hot and 
cold weather. Teachers regularly include a weather 
record with a graph of sun, cloud, rain, or snow pic-
tures during calendar activities. Such activities alert 
children to the importance of temperature in their 
lives and provide a rationale for measuring and re-
cording temperatures.

What ranges of temperatures do you consider hot, 
cold, and comfortable? Compare your temperatures

Teaching Children 
to Measure Time
Marilyn Burns (1989) says that time appears in our 
lives in two different ways. One way is when we think 
about an interval of time—how long something 
takes: “Are we almost there?” “How much longer will 
it take?” The other way is when we are concerned 
E
with a particular time of day: “What time does school 
begin?” “When do I have to go to bed?”
Learning time measurement includes develop-
ment of concepts of duration or elapsed time, se-
quences of events in time, and beginning and end-
ing of events. These time concepts are measured 
with tools such as clocks and calendars. Piaget’s 
research indicates that some children are ready to 
develop a full understanding of time by the age of 
9; others are not ready until 10 or 11. While develop-
ing the concept of time, children may exhibit a poor 
sense of time duration and many misconceptions 
about sequences of events. For example, children 
can confuse which events happened before lunch 
and which happened after lunch. Learning to tell 
time is not the same as understanding elapsed time 
or even the concept of time itself. Many informal 
activities with time help children develop an under-
standing of elapsed time and time measurement.
Activities with sand or water 
timers, such as those described in 
Activity 18.1 (Station 4), help de-
velop a sense of duration. Kitchen 
timers, alarm clocks, and hour-
glasses can also be used for timing 
classroom activities such as races 
and games (Figure 18.5). Children 
learn what a minute is by becom-
ing aware of how many times 
they can jump, clap, or sit and 
stand in a minute (Activities 18.8 
and 18.9).
Children also need experiences with sequences 
or order of events. A classroom schedule alerts 
them to their regular outline of activities. A televi-

sion schedule is used to ﬁ nd and plan television 
viewing. A morning schedule of getting up, eating, 
brushing teeth, dressing, and walking or riding to 
school shows daily sequences. The story sequences 
in children’s books or ﬁ lms, sequences in cartoon 
strips, and sequences of the seasons, plant growth, 
and insect development provide opportunities to 
discuss order of events. Pictures of events and ques-
tions like these will instigate thinking about order:
•  This morning we did some work with subtraction, 
and we made some paper bag puppets. Which 
did we do ﬁ rst? Show with thumbs up if we did 
subtraction ﬁ rst.
•  We did three different things this morning. Raise 
your left hand if you can tell me what we did ﬁ rst. 
(Sample answer: Listened to a story.) What did we 
do next? (Played a math game.) What was the last 
thing we did? (Saw a video about animals.) What 
letters or icons could we use to show the order of 
the three events? (Accept A-B-C or other code.) 
Because the game came after the story, and the 
video came after the game, did the video come 
before or after the story? (This question helps chil-
dren see that if event B follows event A, and event 
C follows event B, then event C follows event A; 
it deals with transitivity, a difﬁ cult concept for 
children to understand.)

pened? What happened at the end of the story? 
What do you think happened after the book 
ended?

•  Tell students that you will time them as they try to per-
form the task as many times as possible.
•  Allow students time to estimate their task completion 
total.
•  Have students work with a partner who will count the 
tasks as the partner performs them.
•  Allow students the opportunity to practice their tasks 
before timing them.
•  Time the tasks as the partner counts them, and then have 
the partners reverse roles and time again.
•  Have students keep track of their estimated number and 
the number of times they performed the task in the allot-
ted time.
•  Repeat with tasks that the students suggest.

Clocks and Watches
Digital and analog timepieces are part of the chil-
dren’s world, and they should learn to read time 
with both. For both digital and analog devices the 
underlying concept is the constant passing of sec-
onds, minutes, and hours.
The digital clock shows the current time only. 
An analog clock shows current time but also does 
more. The 15 digits in the numbers 1– 12 and mov-
ing hands enable children to note the beginning and 
ending times for an event and the elapsed times be-
tween. A child who says, “A half-hour has passed 
since we began our walk at 3 o’clock” is noting 
that the minute hand moved from 3:00 to halfway 
between 3:00 and 4:00. When a parent says, “It is 
2:00; we have 45 minutes before the plane leaves 
at 2:45,” a clock face makes it easy to see 2:00 and 
the distance the minute hand must move to reach 
2:45. Reading times in airplane and train schedules, 
television guides, and other written materials also 
prepares students for telling time with clocks. The 
photo illustrates a variety of time-telling materials, 
including rubber stamps, student clocks, work-
sheets, and books.
•  Begin with a large demonstration clock with nu-
merals marked prominently in black. Talk about 
the sequence of numbers. Children should note 
that 12 is at the top, 3 on the right, 6 at the bottom, 
and 9 on the left. Prepare a worksheet with one 
large clock face but no numerals. Children are 
to write the numerals at each hour mark (Fig  -
ure 18.6a).
•  Add a black hour hand to the clock. Point it at 
the 1. Tell children that the black hand points to a 
number that tells the hour. Rotate the hand from 1 
to 2 to 3, and so on, as children count. Then point 
it at different numbers and have children tell the 
hour (Figure 18.6b).
•  Put blue minute marks and a blue minute hand 
on a clock face. Tell children that while the hour 
hand points to the hour numerals, the minute 
hand points to the blue marks for minutes. They 
can count by ﬁ ves and by ones as they move the 
blue hand around the clock (Figure 18.6c).
•  Using both clocks, set the hour hand on an hour 
(say, 2) and the minute hand at 0 minutes. Read 
the times as the hands move forward to 2:05, 2:10, 
2:15, and so on. As the minute hand goes past 30, 
advance the hour hand and ask why the hour 
hand is also moving. Ask children to predict what 
happens to the hour hand as the minute hand 
moves closer to 60 minutes.
•  To help children realize the meaning of 5 min-
utes, have them watch the classroom clock. 
Remind them to watch the minute hand and the 
hour hand. Ask them to write in their journals 
what they notice.
•  Use a clock with synchronized hands to show the 
coordinated movement of the hour hand and the 
minute hand. Have children watch and read the

Figure 18.6 illustrates one sequence of activi-
ties for learning to read a clock. The sequence, de-
scribed in the list that follows, is not an isolated unit 
of instruction; the activities are spread over time 
and completed by the end of the primary grades 
(National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989, 
p. 91). Some students are ready to read the clock 
in ﬁ rst grade; others need several years to become 
proﬁ cient.

understanding of the routine of everyday life, with 
the time of day as the organizing factor.
Children in the intermediate grades continue to 
practice clock-reading skills. Topics can be incorpo-
rated from social studies and science units to extend 
children’s understanding of time concepts. Interdis-
ciplinary units might develop such topics as the es-
tablishment of uniform time zones around the world, 
the history of telling time, and the nature of preci-
sion instruments (e.g., electronic timers) that record 
time. A simple sundial set up on a sunny day gives 
an opportunity to see how an ancient time-telling 
device works (Figure 18.7). The sundial has science, 
social studies, and mathematical connections.

Daytimer Clock (Representation)
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students locate daily events in their lives around a clock.
Materials: Large clock face on paper
•  Ask students to write down some of the activities that 
they do every day.
•  Have students assign a time to those activities that hap-
pen about the same time every day.
•  Give students the task of drawing six of their daily activi-
ties around the clock face, at the time of day when they 
happen.
•  Have students display their completed clock faces and 
describe the activities they have portrayed.
minutes as the hands turn. Ask children to com-
pare the movement of the two hands. (Answer: 
While the minute hand makes one complete 
turn, the hour hand moves from one hour to 
the next.)
•  Ask children to think of half a circle. Cover half of 
the demonstration clock, and ask children how 
many minutes is half of an hour. (Answer: 30.) 
Emphasize that when the minute hand points to 
30, the hour hand is halfway between two numer-
als. Set the hands at different half-hour positions 
for children to read the time (e.g., “2 hours and 30 
minutes”).
•  Introduce writing of time on the even hour 
(9 hours and 0 minutes, 9:00). As soon as that 
notation is set, have children read and write half-
hours (2:30, 8:30) and then any hour and minute 
combination. Show and discuss two ways of writ-
ing time to the hour: 9:00 and 9 o’clock.
•  Show the relationship between a given time and 
30 minutes later by moving the minute hand as 
children skip count by ﬁ ves to 30. Be sure that 
children note that the new position of the minute 
hand is directly across from the original position 
of the minute hand. The minute hand moved 
halfway around the clock.
Another way to help younger children gain a 
foundational understanding of the passing of time is 
to have them produce a daily event calendar, as de-
scribed in Activity 18.10. Focusing on familiar events 
and the time during the day that each event takes 
place will enable younger children to gain a sense of 
the time durations involved between events and an

Calendars
Although many primary-grade children do not pos-
sess the maturational readiness to understand fully 
how a calendar indicates time, they do learn about 
the passage of time and the sequence of events. 
They learn that calendars indicate days of the week, 
with the number, or date, for each day, the month 
of the year, and the year itself. Calendars such as 
the one in Figure 18.8 can be purchased or teacher-
made and are often part of a classroom routine.
On each school day a new date is added to show 
the new day. Discuss with the children the month 
and day of the week; the number date of the day; 
anything special about the day, such as a classmate’s 
birthday; and the number of days in the month that 
have already passed. One eventful day to note with 
students is Hundred Day, the 100th day of school. 
Older students can observe Pi Day (March 14 or 
3/14) and Metric Day (Oc to ber 10 or 10/10) with re-
lated activities.
Teachers can assist children’s understanding of 
the calendar as a record of passing time by putting 
the days of the month in a continuous line with a bal-
loon on each number. When the balloon is popped, 
the day has passed and the number of that day is 
revealed. The month can then be cut into strips and 
reorganized into the traditional month calendar. 
Some teachers show the entire calendar as a con-
tinuous line around the classroom. Cut a calendar 
with large numerals into horizontal strips showing 
one week each, and glue or staple the strips for the 
entire year end to end to a long piece of calcula-
tor tape. Labels for each child’s birthday, signiﬁ cant 
school days, and holidays of ethnic and cultural 
groups in the class provide a reminder of past and 
upcoming events. Labels, pictures, or color coding 
for the seasons invite discussion of the seasonal 
cycle. Children can compare the number of days 
between Columbus Day and Thanksgiving to those 
between New Year’s Day and President’s Day, count 
the days until the next class birthday, and so on.
E X E RC I S E
Several time expressions have diminished in com-
mon use: “quarter past ﬁ ve,” “half past nine,” and 
“a quarter to ten.” Therefore many teachers believe 
children should read and write these times as “ﬁ ve 
ﬁ fteen, “nine thirty,” and “nine forty-ﬁ ve.” What is 
your opinion? What are the advantages and disad-
vantages of each expression? •••
In early grades calendar work should emphasize 
the calendar as a record of children’s experience. 
Elementary school children are just developing a 
sense of historical time. Their own life is the only his-
tory they really understand, although they enjoy sto-
ries of “long ago and far away.” Care must be taken 
in selecting which days to highlight. It is reasonable 
to list student’s birthdays, as suggested here, but 
some students may be offended by any special rec-
ognition or celebration of their birthday. Likewise, 
religious holidays might be suitably acknowledged, 
but activities that revolve around such holidays may 
be inappropriate for children of another faith.

to a clerk, or the child shows coins and the clerk 
takes the amount needed. Even with these experi-
ences, young children have difﬁ culty separating the 
value of coins from their size. For instance, a penny 
and a nickel are both larger than a dime, yet a dime 
has greater value than either of the other coins. As 
children grow, they learn the value of each coin and 
bill. Work in preschool and kindergarten begins 
with activities designed to acquaint children with 
coins in a classroom store, where they may pretend 
to buy things with play money. A school store with 
pencils, paper, and school supplies gives practi-
cal experience with real money for older children. 
Some schools have older students collect money in 
school cafeterias.
Early money activities are conﬁ ned to identiﬁ ca-
tion of small-value coins. In the primary grades, un-
derstanding the values of coins related to 1 dollar is 
developed, and then bills are introduced. Real-look-
ing plastic or pasteboard models of coins and bills 
are available from teacher stores and school-supply 
vendors.
When children work with realistic models, they 
may still be preoperational, and so they cannot 
conserve attributes of objects. One consequence is 
that they will not grasp the relationships between 
pennies and nickels, nickels and dimes, and so on. 
These many-to-one and many-to-many matchings 
are confusing because no physical relationship ex-
ists between one coin and another. A set of propor-
tional materials helps children understand relation-
ships among all coins and a dollar. In this model a 
nickel is half the size of a dime, and a quarter is ﬁ ve 
times as large as a nickel. All the other relationships 
between coin values are preserved in the area rela-
tionships in this model.
•  Duplicate on tagboard a 10  10 grid like the 
one shown in Figure 18.9. Each grid piece can be 
about 4 centimeters square.
•  The 10  10 grid has ﬁ ve small 1  1 squares 
representing pennies, two 1  5 rectangles repre-
senting nickels, one 2  5 rectangle representing 
a dime, a large 5  5 square for a quarter, and a 
large 5  10 rectangle for a half-dollar.
•  Have the children make kits of money pieces by 
cutting out the grid and stamping or drawing pen-
nies on one side of the tagboard and the equiva-
lent nickel, dime, quarter, or half-dollar on the 
other side. They may wish to cut and mark two 
or three grids so that they can have more money 
pieces. They can leave one grid uncut as a full 
dollar value.
•  Students can use the money pieces as puzzles to 
answer questions, such as
How many pennies cover a nickel?
How many nickels cover a dime?
What different combinations cover a quarter?”
•  As they gain conﬁ dence, they can use the pieces 
to show combinations:
Show 7 cents.
Show 32 cents.
What are the fewest coins you can use to make 
 67 cents?
•  Tell children that the word cent stands for 1 part 
out of 100 parts. Ask the meaning of 1 cent, 
Figure 18.9 Proportional money materials

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, and 50 cents, and 
introduce the cent sign (¢).
•  Use the coin pieces for change-making activities. 
Display a picture of a small toy and a price. If the 
toy’s price is 35 cents, children start with 100 cents. 
They pay for the toy and see how much they have 
left.
•  Demonstrate how to count change by ﬁ rst count-
ing larger denominations and counting up: 
“twenty-ﬁ ve, thirty-ﬁ ve, forty-ﬁ ve, ﬁ fty, ﬁ fty-two.”
•  As students gain conﬁ dence, introduce real coins 
or models for the grid pieces.
•  For older children learning about decimal values, 
the grid can be used to introduce the decimal 
values 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50.
Activities with these materials come at the point 
when children are beginning to grasp the concept 
that coins have relational values, in concert with 
their developmental stage when they are able to 
conserve. Children exemplify this understanding 
when they recognize that 5 pennies has the same 
value as 1 nickel and that 5 nickels has the value of 
1 quarter. Children who are familiar with coins and 
small bills maintain and expand their understand-
ing by regularly engaging in activities using money 
for real or vicarious situations. Working individually 
or in groups, they can complete simple buying ac-
tivities or more advanced activities.
Older children who have an understanding of 
decimal fraction computation solve problems and 
engage in real-life activities that involve computa-
tions with money. They simulate purchases, pre-
pare budgets for allowances, explore newspaper 
advertisements for a shopping cart of groceries, 
and engage in related activities that require decimal 
computation.
Michelle Craig, a primary-grade teacher in the 
Elk Grove, California, Uniﬁ ed School District, uses 
music and silly jingles to help children learn. One 
song was written to help second-graders understand 
the role of the decimal point in recording amounts 
of money. Her song “The Decimal Point Blues” has 
a lilting rhythm that makes it fun for children to sing 
and others to hear. The words to the song are on the 
companion website.
Extending Measurement 
Concepts
For older children the measurement focus is on 
broadening the applications of measurement to 
other contexts and on extending measurement con-
cepts such as angle measure, area, and volume. The 
NCTM measurement standards for older children 
are the following.
NCTM Measurement Standard
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 
12 should enable all students to:
Understand measurable attributes of objects and the 
units, systems, and processes of measurement
Grades 3– 5 Expectations:
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  understand such attributes as length, area, weight, vol-
ume, and size of angle and select the appropriate type of 
unit for measuring each attribute;
•  understand the need for measuring with standard units 
and become familiar with standard units in the customary 
and metric systems;
•  carry out simple unit conversions, such as from centime-
ters to meters, within a system of measurement;
•  understand that measurements are approximations and 
how differences in units affect precision;
•  explore what happens to measurements of a two-dimen-
sional shape such as its perimeter and area when the 
shape is changed in some way.
Grades 6– 8 Expectations:
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  understand both metric and customary systems of 
measurement;
•  understand relationships among units and convert from 
one unit to another within the same system;
•  understand, select, and use units of appropriate size and 
type to measure angles, perimeter, area, surface area, and 
volume.
Apply appropriate techniques, tools, and formulas to 
determine measurements
Grades 3– 5 Expectations:
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  develop strategies for estimating the perimeters, areas, 
and volumes of irregular shapes;
•  select and apply appropriate standard units and tools to 
measure length, area, volume, weight, time, temperature, 
and the size of angles;
•  select and use benchmarks to estimate measurements;
•  develop, understand, and use formulas to ﬁ nd the area of 
rectangles and related triangles and parallelograms;
•  develop strategies to determine the surface areas and vol-
umes of rectangular solids.
Grades 6– 8 Expectations:
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  use common benchmarks to select appropriate methods 
for estimating measurements;
•  select and apply techniques and tools to accurately ﬁ nd 
length, area, volume, and angle measures to appropriate 
levels of precision;

 
Chapter 18 Developing and Extending Measurement Concepts 
461
•  develop and use formulas to determine the circumference 
of circles and the area of triangles, parallelograms, trap-
ezoids, and circles and develop strategies to ﬁ nd the area 
of more-complex shapes;
•  develop strategies to determine the surface area and vol-
ume of selected prisms, pyramids, and cylinders;
•  solve problems involving scale factors, using ratio and 
proportion;
•  solve simple problems involving rates and derived mea-
surements for such attributes as velocity and density.
Extending Concepts 
About Length
In the early grades children explore the concept of 
length by learning how to use iteration and trans-
ference to measure lengths. They also begin to use 
a simple ruler to determine the lengths of speciﬁ c 
items. Their explorations lay the groundwork for fur-
ther explorations in intermediate grades. Children 
in the primary grades examine fairly short lengths of 
up to, perhaps, 10 feet.
When lengths become much greater, even a 
meterstick or yardstick becomes inconvenient. A 
trundle wheel (available from school-supply ven-
dors) or a surveyor’s wheel makes measuring easier. 
The wheel, which is attached to a long handle, has 
a circumference of 1 meter. As it is rolled across a 
surface, there is a “click” that indicates that one rota-
tion of the wheel has measured 1 meter; clicks are 
counted to determine distances. Children can mea-
sure lengths of hallways, sidewalks, playgrounds, 
and other distances in and around their school with 
a trundle wheel (see photo).
Once children become comfortable using un-
marked rulers, they are ready to use rulers with 
divisions on them. The ﬁ rst ruler of this type may 
show only whole-centimeter units or whole-inch 
units with no numerals, like the ruler in Figure 18.10. 
The absence of numerals means that children must 
count units to determine an object’s length. Rulers 
such as these can be duplicated and cut from tag-
board for Activity 18.12. Marking the starting place 
with green serves as a reminder to children to place 
the green end of the ruler at one end of the object. 
Numerals have been added to the ruler in Figure 
18.11 so that children can determine the measure 
of an object with numerals rather than by counting 
units. The green end of the tagboard ruler becomes 
the “0” number on the numbered ruler.

In Activity 18.11 students examine standard 
length units and select the appropriate unit for the 
object being measured. For example, the height of 
a tree should be measured in feet or meters and not 
in inches or millimeters. In Activity 18.12 students 
measure objects to the nearest centimeter.
In Activity 18.13 students measure the same ob-
ject using rulers marked with increasingly detailed 
precision. The more detailed the precision, the more 
accurate the measure. As children develop their 
ability to measure with increasing precision, they 
can have difﬁ culty interpreting the different mark-
ings on their ruler. The Master Ruler (see photo)

ACTIVITY 18.12
 
To the Nearest Centimeter (Assessment Activity)
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Individual or small groups
Objective: Students measure objects to the nearest centimeter.
Materials: Centimeter cubes and rods; centimeter ruler; objects 
to measure, 3– 20 centimeters long (e.g., 35-mm ﬁ lm boxes, ball-
point pens, books, dowels, variety of pencils)
•  Lay the centimeter cubes and rods next to the object be-
ing measured. Make sure the rods are lined up with the 
object. Count the rods.
•  Measure the same object with the centimeter ruler, stress-
ing the importance of placing the end of the object at the 
end of the ruler. Emphasize careful counting.
•  Compare the measures from the rods and the ruler.
•  Ask students to tell which number the object is closer to, 
using language such as “longer than,” “shorter than,” or 
“nearly.”
•  Provide problem cards for further measurements.
Using Centimeters
Use centimeter cubes and rods and the tagboard 
ruler to measure the items and answer the following 
questions.
1.  How many centimeters long is the plastic pen?
2.  How many centimeters long is the yellow spoon?
3.  How many centimeters long is the ﬁ lm box? How 
wide is the ﬁ lm box? Is the end of the ﬁ lm box 
shaped like a square?
4.  How many centimeters long is the strip of blue 
paper?
5.  Find three things in the room that are longer than 
20 centimeters.
6.  Find three things in the room that are shorter than 
20 centimeters.
7.  Write and draw your measurements in your journal.
Compare your answers with those of another group 
of students. If there are any disagreements, remeasure 
the objects in question to determine which is the best 
measurement.

 
Chapter 18 Developing and Extending Measurement Concepts

enables children to measure an item with a single 
ruler, using different levels of precision, one after 
the other. The comments of Rachel, a fourth-grader 
who engaged in the measuring described in Activity 
18.13 are shown in Figure 18.12. When asked about 
the different lengths for the same object, Rachel re-
sponded that it depended on the ruler. She thought 
it was easiest to use the inch ruler, but thought the 
quarter-inch ruler was best, “because it gives a 
closer answer.” Over time, children work with me-
tersticks, trundle wheels, and measuring tapes with 
subdivisions marked in decimeters, centimeters, 
and millimeters.
The pencil in Figure 18.13a is slightly longer than 
10 centimeters, and the pencil in Figure 18.13b is 
slightly shorter than 10 centimeters. Children learn 
that, measured to the nearest whole centimeter, 
each one has a measure of 10 centimeters. When 
the endpoint of an object lies near the midpoint be-
tween two units, a judgment must be made about 
its measure. The ﬁ rst pencil might be reported as 
being a little more than 10 centimeters long by one 
child, as less than 11 centimeters by another, and 
as being about 10.5 centimeters by yet another. The 
children interpret the measure of the pencil differ-
ently, and yet each gives a correct approximate mea-
sure for it. Measurements are recorded in different 
ways, depending on children’s maturity and under-
standing. For instance, children in primary grades 
would probably record a child’s height as 138 cen-
timeters, whereas older ones would record the 
same height as 1.38 meters. Unlike the English sys-
tem, units are not mixed when a measurement is 
recorded in the metric system. The height of 1.38 
meters would not be recorded as 1 meter 38 centi-
meters or as 1 m 38 cm, although in the English sys-
tem recording a height as 5 feet 3 inches is perfectly 
acceptable.

Although a conceptual foundation for measuring many dif-
ferent attributes should be developed during the early grades, 
linear measurements are the main emphasis. (Burns, 1989, 
pp. 23– 24)
Conversion between measures in the English sys-
tem can be challenging for some older students. For 
example, when asked to convert 180 inches to feet, 
students can usually recall that 12 inches equals 1 
foot. However, they may be unsure whether to mul-
tiply or divide by 12 to make the conversion. They 
may struggle to recall, “When changing to feet, di-
vide by 12. When changing to inches, multiply by 
12.” Rather than trying to have students memorize a 
rule about when to multiply or divide, it is more ben-
eﬁ cial to have students ﬁ rst determine the magni-
tude of the answer. In other words, will the number 
of feet in the answer be larger or smaller than the 
number of inches given in the problem? Students 
can be helped to reason that since feet are a larger 
unit of length than inches, fewer feet are needed to 
equal the same length in inches (see the discussion 
on the principle of compensation on p. 448). Thus 
the number of feet in this problem must be less than 
the number of inches, so the number of feet is equal 
to 180 divided by 12. Another strategy that children 
might use is to draw up a table of values:
Feet 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
10 
12 
15
Inches 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 120 144 180
Children can use tables as an intermediate strategy 
before they advance to computation to solve conver-
sion problems.

ACTIVITY 18.14
 
Step Lively! (Reasoning and Proof)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Individual
Objective: Students compare steps to 10-meter length.
Materials: None
•  Measure a distance of 10 meters in the classroom or a 
nearby hallway.
•  Have each child walk from one end to the other, counting 
each step, 10 times.
•  Have each child determine the mean average number of 
steps required to walk 10 meters.
•  Provide opportunities for students to use their paces to 
determine the approximate distance between places on 
the school grounds.
ACTIVITY 18.15
 
How Much Is 50 Meters?
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students estimate distance.
Materials: Chalk
•  Take the children to a playground and ask them to line up 
along a chalk line you have marked on the hardtop (or the 
edge of a sidewalk).
•  Instruct the children to wait for your signal to walk across 
the playground for the distance each thinks is 50 meters, 
then stop.
•  Have a pair of children use a metric trundle wheel or a 
metric measuring tape to measure 50 meters.
•  Have students note where the children who measured 
50 meters are standing and evaluate their own estimates.
•  Repeat the activity for 50 meters, 75 meters, 20 meters, 
and so on. Have children evaluate each estimate and note 
their own improvement.
Estimation and Mental 
Models of Length
In many situations actual measurement is not 
needed. A landscaper can step off a lawn’s length 
and width to estimate square footage and determine 
the amount of fertilizer needed for an adequate feed-
ing. A bicyclist estimates distances to lay out a route 
for a ride of about 30 miles. As children develop 
mental models for different units of length, they 
improve their estimates. Experiences with avail-
able objects develop mental models for estimating 
length measures: A dime is approximately 1 milli-
meter thick, the nail on a child’s thumb is about 1 
centimeter wide, and the chalk rail in classrooms is 
approximately 1 meter or yard above the ﬂ oor.
The best way for children to get a sense of greater 
distances, such as a kilometer or a mile, is to walk (or 
slowly drive) the distances with an adult. Establish a 
route on the school playground or locate landmarks 
that are approximately 1 kilometer or 1 mile from 
school—a child’s house, a store, a sign. As you walk 
at a steady pace, have students note the time. By do-
ing this, they come to understand how much time it 
takes to walk the kilometer or mile and can use that 
knowledge to estimate both shorter and longer dis-
tances. Activities 18.14 and 18.15 help children use 
paces to establish a reference point for estimating 
distances. They can also record distances in miles 
or kilometers on trips they take in the car or on the 
bus to the grocery store, library, or playground.
Children in the upper elementary grades can use 
their knowledge of decimal fractions and their men-
tal models of lengths as they learn to rename metric 
units. With experience and opportunity to develop 
the mental models, they can ﬁ nd the equivalence 
without resorting to moving decimal points around.
•  To rename 148 centimeters as meters, think: 
“Since 100 centimeters is 1 meter, 148 centimeters 
would be 1 meter and about half a meter or 0.48 
meter, so 1.48 meters.”
•  To rename 428 meters to kilometers, think: “If 
1,000 meters is 1 kilometer; 428 meters is less 
than half of a kilometer, so 428 meters is 0.428 
kilometer.”

 
Chapter 18 Developing and Extending Measurement Concepts 
465
•  To rename 1.67 meters as centimeters, think: 
“Since 100 centimeters is a meter, 1.67 meters is 
100 centimeters plus 67 more centimeters, or 167 
centimeters.”
Extending Concepts About Area
By the end of elementary school students should be 
able to (1) name common area units and express 
them in writing, (2) measure small regions directly 
by using square grids and cardboard pieces in both 
customary and metric area units, (3) estimate ar-
eas using appropriate mental models, and (4) de-
termine area indirectly by measuring the sides of a 
region and developing a formula for area. The con-
nection between multiplication arrays and area is 
important as students move away from determining 
area by counting each square and toward the use 
of formulas.
Measuring and Estimating Area
Measuring the areas of surfaces using nonstandard 
measures, such as index cards, hexagons, and 
pizza box lids, leads to use of standard units. Stu-
dents should see that each length measure has a 
corresponding area unit: inch to square inch (in.2), 
foot to square foot (ft2), yard to square yard (yd2), 
centimeter to square centimeter (cm2), and meter 
to square meter (m2). The problem card shown in 
Figure 18.14 involves ﬁ nding areas of small regions 
at a learning center. The measuring device is a cen-
timeter transparency grid that children put on top of 
shapes and regions to count and measure. In the re-
gions marked B and C, areas cannot be determined 
by simply multiplying whole numbers as in Region 
A. Children must use estimation to determine their 
areas.
Following the problem card activities, children 
can explain and discuss their procedures. Depend-
ing on how they place the grids on the shapes or 
how they interpret the size of partial measures, chil-
dren’s measurements for the same region will differ 
and open the issue of approximation and estima-
tion of area. A teacher-guided discussion about the 
area of the rectangle marked B might include these 
questions:
•  How many square units are entirely within the 
region? (Answer: 32.)
•  How many square units are partially within the 
region? (Answer: 13.)
•  What is the largest possible area and the smallest 
possible area based on those two facts? (An-
swer: 32 whole squares is minimum area, and 45 
squares is largest area.)
In ancient Egypt long distances were determined by profes-
sionals called rope stretchers. These men tied a speciﬁ c length 
of rope to their ankles. They were trained to walk in a straight 
line for long distances, and at every stride they stretched the 
rope until it was taut. They measured distances by the num-
ber of strides they took. Each complete stride was eventually 
called a stadium.

FINDING AREAS 
Use plastic grids and geometric figures and free-flowing shapes to complete these activities.
1.  Your first task is to determine which of the shapes have a whole number of square-centimeter units 
and which include parts of units along with whole units. Identify the shapes in each category by list-
ing their letters on paper. 
2.  Measure each shape and write its area on your paper. Make your best estimates of the areas for 
shapes that do not contain just whole square-centimeter units.
3.  Write explanations of how you determined the area of the different types of shapes.

ACTIVITY 18.16
 
Area of a Parallelogram
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Whole group
Objective: Students ﬁ nd the area of a parallelogram.
Materials: Geoboards, cutouts of rectangles and parallelograms
•  Give each student a rectangle and a parallelogram with 
the same height and length. Ask students what the area 
of the rectangle is. The geoboard can be used to show 
that the area is length  height.
•  Repeat with several other rectangles and parallelograms.
•  Ask students if they can use the same formula for the area 
of a rectangle and the area of a parallelogram with the 
same height and length. (The area formula for a paral-
lelogram is sometimes stated as A  b  h, where b is the 
base and h is the height.)
•  Ask students to cut their parallelograms to make the 
rectangle shape. They can fold and cut off one end of the 
parallelograms and move it to the other end.
•  Have students now compute the area of each 
parallelogram.
•  How might you estimate the area of the 13 partial 
squares? (Answer: Combine the partial squares to 
approximate whole squares.)
•  What is a good total estimate of the area? (An-
swer: maybe 36, 37, or 38.)
The teacher could have students work in pairs to 
reason about the area of the irregular shape in re-
gion C. In Activity 18.5 students used some of these 
area concepts as they determined the area of their 
footprint.
The square mile and the acre are used for most 
land measures in the United States. Children can 
learn about the acre by marking one on a playing 
ﬁ eld. To illustrate 1 acre, a teacher could place col-
ored pylons in a square with corners approximately 
70 yards apart. Students might want to ﬁ nd the ap-
proximate number of acres for the entire school 
ground or a nearby shopping center; they can use 
paces to estimate lengths and widths to estimate ar-
eas of larger parcels of land. Teachers could also 
use aerial photographs with an acre drawn on the 
photographs. The corresponding metric units, the 
are (10 meters by 10 meters, or 100 square meters) 
and the hectare (100 ares, or 10,000 square meters), 
are seldom used in the United States.
Inventing Area Formulas
As children measure rectangles and squares, they 
often relate them to their knowledge of the area con-
cept of multiplication. Young children can determine 
that a 4  8 rectangular array contains 32 squares, 
and they can use this image to begin to learn the 
multiplication fact that 4  8  32. Similarly, the 
area of a 4-centimeter by 8-centimeter rectangular 
array of squares has 4  8  32 square centimeters, 
or more generally:
Area of rectangle  base  height
Teacher-led activities provide the applied in-
struction for children to understand area formulas 
for parallelograms and triangles (Activities 18.16 
and 18.17). When students see the area relationship 
between a rectangle and a parallelogram of the 
same height and base, they will more easily under-
stand and remember that the formula for the area 
of a parallelogram is A  bh, as they will the area 
formula for a triangle, A  1
2 bh. Activity 18.17 helps 
students focus on base length and height rather than 
shape or appearance when considering the area of 
a triangle.
The companion website activity “Geoboard Tri-
angles” expands students understanding of triangle 
area by using a geoboard to form different triangles 
with the same base and height. No matter how dif-
ferent the triangles appear, they must all have the 
same area. The companion website activity “Half a 
Rectangle” uses a geoboard to relate the area of a 
right triangle to half the area of a rectangle.
One additional polygon that students study in the 
intermediate grades is the trapezoid. Children can 
develop the area formula for a trapezoid in much 

the same way that Activities 18.16 and 18.17 describe 
how to discover the area formulas for parallelograms 
and triangles. In the diagram here a trapezoid has 
two parallel bases and two nonparallel sides (legs):
b1
b2
Any trapezoid can be reproduced and rotated, as 
shown here, to form a parallelogram. The area of 
the resulting parallelogram is twice the area of the 
original trapezoid:
b1
b2
b2
b1
The area of the parallelogram is found with the for-
mula: A  bh. In this case the height h is the same in 
the composite parallelogram as in the original trap-
ezoid. The base of the parallelogram is composed of 
the sum of the two bases of the original trapezoid (b1 
 b2). Thus the area of the parallelogram is found 
with the formula
A  bh  or  A  (b1  b2)h
Because the original trapezoid is only half the area 
of the parallelogram, the formula for the area of the 
trapezoid is
A  1
2(b1  b2)h
A ﬁ nal ﬁ gure for stu-
dents in the intermediate 
grades to study is the cir-
cle. An integral part of any 
study of the circle is p, a 
value related to both the 
perimeter (circumference) 
and area of a circle. It is 
commonly thought of as 
the circumference-diam-
eter ratio. p is the number 
of times the length of the 
diameter of a circle will 
ﬁ t around the circumfer-
ence. p is an irrational 
number. It cannot be expressed as a ratio of two 
integers (a/b). Any decimal representation of the 
value of p will extend to inﬁ nity with no repeating 
pattern in the number. As a consequence, there are 
two common approximations that are used for the 
value of p: 3.14 and 22
7 . These approximations are 
not equal but are used interchangeably according 
to the problem setting and the numerical values in 
the setting. For a problem with data in the form of 
decimal fractions, 3.14 would be the appropriate ap-
proximation to use.
Activity 18.18 focuses on the value of p as a ratio 
for the circumference to the diameter. In this activity 
students generate data to approximate the value of

Triangles Are Half a Parallelogram (Representation)
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students develop the area formula for a triangle by link-
ing triangles and parallelograms.
Materials: Rulers, scissors
•  Pass out lined paper to students in groups.
•  Have students cut out an acute triangle and then use that 
triangle to trace and cut out two congruent triangles.
•  Challenge students to form a parallelogram out of two of 
the triangles.
•  Ask students for the formula for the area of a parallelo-
gram. (Answer: A  b  h.)
•  Have students compare the remaining triangle and the 
composite parallelogram.
•  How do the heights compare? (Answer: They are the 
same.) How do the base lengths compare? (Answer: They 
are the same.) How do their areas compare? (Answer: The 
triangle area is one-half the parallelogram area.)
•  Repeat with several other triangles.
•  Have students answer the following questions:
1.  What is the formula for the area of a parallelogram?
2.  How does the area of a triangle compare to the area of 
a parallelogram with the same base and height?
3.  What is the area formula for a triangle?
4.  Use a diagram to explain why your formula in Question 
3 is correct.
MISCONCEPTION
The area formula for a 
trapezoid can be 
challenging for some 
children. Some will 
replace the addition 
operation with multiplica-
tion, probably because 
all previous area formulas 
used only multiplication. 
Some will misapply the 
distributive law and apply 
the 1
2 to only one base, 
rather than to the sum of 
the bases.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
p. Most students easily determine that the value of p 
is a bit more than 3, and it is common for a class re-
sult to approximate the value of p to several decimal 
places. However, children’s ﬁ rst explorations using 
p to determine the area or circumference of a circle 
may be clouded when they try to use either 22
7  or 3.14 
as an approximation for p. When students try to use 
22
7  or 3.14, they become distracted with the computa-
tional aspect of the problem and lose their focus on 
the problem itself and the reasonableness of their 
answer. We recommend that students who begin to 
explore the circumference and area of circles use 3 
for an approximation of p, with the understanding 
that any value used to represent p is an approxima-
tion and that 3 is a reasonable initial representation 
for p. Experiences with activities such as Activity 
18.18 help students internalize that the value of p 
is a little more than 3. When students use 3 for the 
value of p, they are then able to concentrate on the 
problem and the reasonableness of their answer. In 
Activity 18.18 students might represent C/d to the 
nearest whole number (3) rather than to tenths or 
hundredths.
The area of a circle also involves the value of 
p. The area formula is A  pr2. Activity 18.19 helps 
students discover this relationship by cutting up a 
circle and reassembling the pieces to form a paral-
lelogram, much like some of the preceding activities 
with quadrilaterals. As shown here, the eight pieces 
or sectors of a circle can be reassembled to form 
a parallelogram. Note that the height of the paral-
lelogram is r, the radius of the circle. The base of 
the parallelogram is 1
2 the entire circumference. One 
way to determine C is by the formula C  2pr. Thus 
1
2C  pr. These two values can be used in the area 
formula for a parallelogram as follows:
A  bh
A  pr  r  pr2
r
A point of confusion for many older students is 
the difference between perimeter and area. These 
two concepts are often presented together, but they 
are markedly different and need to be developed 
carefully. Perimeter is a length measure and can be 
taught with length measurement activities. Children 
need the opportunity to engage in many activities 
in which they determine the area and perimeter of 
real objects by direct measurement. In addition, 
students should have ample opportunities to solve 
problems with real-world settings. Such activities 
and problems will help them distinguish between 
the two.
After concepts of perimeter and area measure-
ment have been developed, investigations into re-
lationships between the two offer opportunities for 
students to engage in worthwhile problem-solving 
activities. Questions such as the following can insti-
gate group or individual activities and discussions:
•  A plan for a ﬂ ower garden requires 144 square 
feet for all the ﬂ owers that will be planted. The 
gardener wants to use the least possible amount 
of edging material to go around it. What shape 
and dimensions should the garden have?

Objective: Students explore the circumference-diameter ratio.
Materials: Internet connection
•  Have students go to http://ejad.best.vwh.net/java/java

•  Students then follow the directions in the activity to roll 
various circles one full revolution (circumference).
•  Students record the diameter and circumference of each 
circle and compute C/d on a line.
•  Ask if students have seen this value or relationship before, 
then link their result to p.
•  Challenge students to use their ﬁ ndings to determine the 
circumference of a tower clock with a 4 foot diameter.
•  As an alternative, students could use measure disks. See 
the companion website activity “Exploring p.”

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
tween area and perimeter for each rectangle. Fur-
thermore, the square shape of a rectangle provides 
the minimum perimeter for a given area.
Extending Capacity Concepts
Younger children work with activities that will lay 
the foundation for understanding capacity, as sug-
gested in Activity 18.1 (Station 1). Older children 
expand their understanding of capacity to identify 
and deﬁ ne capacity units, such as liter, quart, and 
ounce, and also engage in measurement activities 
using these and other capacity measurements.
In a learning center children engage in the ca-
pacity measurement activities outlined in the prob-
lem card shown in Figure 18.15. The center contains 
a variety of containers, some metric and some not, 
including at least one graduated liter measure. Sev-
eral smaller metric containers are desirable but not 
necessary. The nonmetric containers, such as vege-
table and fruit cans, plastic bottles, and wide-mouth 
jars, are selected to hold either more or less than a 
liter; labels that indicate capacity are removed. Each 
container is marked with a letter of the alphabet. 
Students compare the capacity of the jars by ﬁ lling 
them from the graduated liter measure. Such an ex-
perience provides students with a working knowl-
edge of the capacity of a liter. A similar center can 
be set up so children can learn about milliliters with 
specially prepared milliliter containers from school-
supply companies. Small plastic medicine contain-
ers cost little or nothing. Children can use these con-
tainers to determine the capacity of smaller bottles, 
such as those that hold liquid food coloring, spices, 
or perfume.
Extending Volume Concepts
Younger children explore volume relationships in 
a holistic way, as suggested in Activity 18.1. Older 
children begin to quantify volume relationships by 
examining cubic measurements and using volume 
formulas. Volume measures such as cubic inches, 
cubic feet, cubic centimeters, and cubic meters are 
used in many practical ways to indicate the amount 
of space inside a three-dimensional ﬁ gure. An archi-
tect who designs heating and air-conditioning sys-
tems must take into account the volume of a building 
and many other factors, such as building materials, 
windows, climate, and use by people. A manufac-
turer is interested in the volume of containers used 
to pack and ship products. A small container may 
not accommodate a given product; a large one may 
create unnecessary shipping expenses. Some man-
ufacturers stress the large capacity of their refrigera-
tors or SUVs in commercials.
The concept of volume builds on length and area 
concepts. The small metric cubes in a base-10 set 
have edges 1 centimeter long, faces of 1 square cen-
timeter (cm2), and a volume of 1 cubic centimeter 
(cm3); inch cubes have length, area, and cubic mea-
sures in inches, square inches, and cubic inches. 
Small empty boxes and cubes can be used during 
an introductory lesson.
Teacher-made problem cards, such as the one 
in Figure 18.16, placed in the learning center direct

MEASURING CAPACITY
Use the containers to complete the activities.
1.  List the letters of the containers you believe hold less than a liter. List the letters of 
the containers you believe hold more than a liter. Do you believe any of the contain-
ers hold just one liter? If so, list their letters.
2.  List the letters of the containers in the order you believe is correct from smallest to 
largest.
3.  Use the graduated liter container and other metric containers to determine the 
capacity of each container. Do not ﬁll a container higher than the bottom part of the 
neck. Write the letter of each container and its capacity on your paper.
4.  Check your estimates against the actual measurements. List the letters of containers 
for which your estimate was incorrect, if any.
5.  Check your ordering of the containers. If you were mistaken about the placement of 
any of the containers, write the correct order now.

group or individual measurement activities. Supply 
the center with centimeter cubes and several small 
boxes marked with a letter on each. Children work 
in pairs to ﬁ ll each box with cubes. If they ﬁ ll one 
that is about 7 centimeters long, 3 centimeters wide, 
and 3 centimeters high, as in the task card activity, 
students can determine that the volume is about 63 
cm3 by counting the cubes in one layer (21) and then 
multiplying by the number of layers or height (3).
Students explore the volumes of many three-
dimensional ﬁ gures to develop the concept of vol-
ume and common measures. Six square-yard pieces 
of corrugated cardboard can be taped together to 
form a cube. Once students visualize what a cubic 
yard is, they can estimate and measure their class-
room to determine its approximate volume in cubic 
yards (yd3). If the ceiling is high, an adult can mea-
sure the room’s height or children can estimate its 
height. Follow direct measurement activities with 
discussions to encourage students to develop an 
understanding of volume based on the relation-
ship found in measuring and recording the volumes 
of various rectangular solids (Volume  length 
width  height):

Use the centimeter cubes and boxes to complete these 
activities.
1.  Fill box A with centimeter cubes. How many cubes are 
in one layer in the box? How many layers are there? 
How many cubes does the box hold? How many 
centimeters long is each side? The box is how many 
centimeters high? Write your answers on a piece of 
paper.
2.  Fill box B. How many cubes does the box 
hold? How many cubes in each layer? 
How many layers are there? How many 
centimeters long is each side? The box is 
how many centimeters high? Record your 
answers.

the same questions. Record your answers.
4.  You have measured the volume of four boxes and have three sets of numbers for 
each box. One set tells the number of cubes in a box. Another set tells the number 
of cubes in one layer and the number of layers in a box. The third set includes the 
inside dimensions of each box in centimeters. Examine the numbers for box A. What 
connections do you see among the number of cubes in a box, the number of cubes 
in a layer and the number of layers, and the numbers that tell the dimensions? Write

Objective: Students compare volumes of cones to cylinders and of 
cubes to pyramids.
Materials: Packing materials, such as rice or inert packing materi-
als; cone, cylinder, square pyramid, and cube from a commercial 
set such as View Thru Solids, or shapes constructed from tem-
plates (see Black-Line Masters 18.1 and 18.2)
•  Pass out materials to students.
•  Demonstrate how to pour a cone full of packing materials 
into the cylinder.
•  Ask students to estimate how many cones will ﬁ t into 
the cylinder. Note for students that their bases and their 
heights are the same.
•  Ask students to estimate how many pyramids will ﬁ t into 
the cube. Ask students to compare the base areas (same) 
and heights (same) of the two solids.
•  After students make their estimates, allow them to ﬁ ll and 
pour to verify their estimates.
•  Have students write out how to ﬁ nd the volume of a cone 
if its related cylinder has a volume of 150 cubic meters.
•  Have groups report their conclusions to the whole class.
Another way to express the area formula is Volume 
 base area  height:
V  B  h
Consider a box that is 3 
 3  7. When a square 
end (3  3) is viewed as 
the base of the box, it has 
an area of 9 square units. 
The volume can be deter-
mined by multiplying the 
area of the base (B) times 
the height (h). A  B  h 
 9  7  63.
Once students grasp 
this 
relationship, 
they 
have content readiness 
for understanding the for-
mula for the volume of a 
cylinder or a triangular prism (Figure 18.17). For the 
triangular prism the area of the triangle at the base 
is determined ﬁ rst; then the area is multiplied by the 
measure of its height:
V  B  h
In a similar fashion the volume of a cylinder equals 
the area of its circular base times its height. The vol-
umes of cones and pyramids are related to the vol-
umes of cylinders and prisms, respectively. The vol-
ume of a cone with the same base area and height 
as a cylinder, is found by:
V  1
3Bh
Similarly, when a pyramid has the same base area 
and height as a prism, its volume is found by the 
same formula (V  1
3 Bh). Activity 18.21 engages stu-
dents in volume explorations to discover this 1 : 3 re-
lationship between the volumes.
One aspect of volume (and area) measures that 
is confusing for some students is the conversion 
factor between area measures and volume mea-
sures. Students mistakenly will apply the fact that 
12 linear inches equals 1 linear foot to related area 
and volume measures, erroneously thinking that 
12 square inches equals a square foot or 12 cubic 
inches equals a cubic foot. It is helpful to have life-
size models of some area and volume units in the 
classroom for students to examine. When students 
examine a square foot of poster board and a 1-inch 
square tile, they can easily see that a square foot 
contains many more than 12 square inches (Figure 
18.18a). Similarly, when students examine a 1-inch 
block and a cubic foot, they can easily see that a 
cubic foot contains far more than 12 cubic inches 
(Figure 18.18b).

The conversion factors for area and volume units 
are related to the conversion factors for linear units. 
Students do not need to memorize all the conver-
sion factors but can compute them, as the table for 
inches and feet suggests:

144 (12  12, or 122, or 12 squared)

cubic inches  1 cubic foot

Extending Mass 
and Weight Concepts
Weight and mass are not the same. Mass is the 
amount of matter in an object; weight is the gravita-
tional force exerted on the mass. A lunar rover has 
the same mass on Earth as on the moon; however, 
it weighs less on the moon because the moon’s 
gravity is less. Despite the differences, weight is the 
commonly used term because we weigh objects in 
Earth’s gravity and equate weight with an object’s 
mass.
From comparison of different objects and a gen-
eral sense about which are heavy or light (see Activ-
ity 18.1), students progress to standard measures for 
weight. By the time children complete elementary 
school, they should be able to identify English and 
metric weight units, use scales properly, and develop 
reasonable skill in estimating weights. Through 
measuring activities in the English system, they be-
come familiar with their body weight in pounds and 
E
smaller objects in ounces. A classroom display of 
objects weighing about a pound calls attention to an 
important unit for estimating weights. Weights from 
a barbell set may also establish what children con-
sider heavy. Children can research and compare 
the weights of heavy objects (whales, elephants, or 
types of vehicles—compact, standard, and luxury 
cars, trucks, SUVs, and vans). Automobile manufac-
turer websites include weight information about dif-
ferent models. Smaller automobiles may serve as a 
reference object for the ton weight measure of 2,000 
pounds.
The metric units of weight commonly used in 
science and industry are the kilogram, gram, and 
milligram. Just as students create a display of pound 
objects, they can create a display of kilogram ob-
jects and gram objects. Based on the gram objects, 
the weight of a milligram and its possible uses can 
be discussed. A unit children should know but with 
which they are unlikely to have direct contact is the 
metric ton. A metric ton (1,000 kilograms) is slightly 
heavier than a ton of 2,000 pounds in the English 
system. The similarity between the ton and the met-
ric ton weights is more important for children than 
the exact equivalence.
E X E RC I S E
Compare the weight of a shoe to the weight of this 
book and to the weight of another object. Which of 
these three objects do you think weighs closest to a 
pound? closest to a kilogram? •••
Estimating Weights 
and Weighing with Scales
Scales of different types are commonly used in the 
home, grocery store, and doctor’s ofﬁ ce. Children 
may have seen different scales but may not have had 
opportunities to explore how they work. Balance 
scales (see photo) can be placed in a classroom 
weighing center for exploration. With a two-pan 
scale children can directly compare the weights 
of objects to nonstandard weights, such as plastic 
bears or blocks, and to standard weights. In the 
classroom a scale with a set of weights, in either the 
English or the metric system, is needed: ounce and 
pound weights for English; weights of 500 grams, 
250 grams, 100 grams, 50 grams, 10 grams, 5 grams, 
and 1 gram for metric. After direct measurement of

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
weight, children are better able to understand an in-
direct measurement tool such as the sliding-weight 
or electronic scale often used in a doctor’s ofﬁ ce.
When commercial weights are unavailable, a 
teacher can substitute small bags or ﬁ lm canisters 
containing clean sand for 100-, 250-, and 500-gram 
measures or for graduated ounce measures. Fishing 
weights can be used for activities requiring smaller 
weight units. Kitchen-type spring scales for weigh-
ing up to 5 kilograms and a platform bathroom scale 
should be available. Teacher-made problem cards 
can guide children’s weighing activities (Figure 
18.19) in learning centers. One requires a balance 
scale and food commonly sold by weight, such as 
apples, oranges, and hard-shelled nuts; the other 
requires a spring scale and a bathroom scale with 
plastic bags of carrots and dried beans, boxes of pa-
per, and other heavier objects.
As students weigh objects, they learn to estimate 
weight by comparing objects against established ref-
erences. For example, they ﬁ nd the number of me-
dium-size apples or cantaloupes that weighs about 
2 pounds, or nearly a kilogram, and the number of 
cell phones that weigh a pound. They also learn that 
anything weighing 1 gram or 1 ounce, such as grapes 
or strawberries, is light. Mental models for weights 
allow children to estimate the weight of unfamiliar 
objects. A child who envisions a gram as the weight 
of a paper clip can use that image to compare the 
weights of other objects to a gram.
Exploring Density
Younger children might begin to understand the con-
cept of density by comparing how crowded a room 
can be. The more crowded the room, the greater its 
density. In upper elementary grade science classes, 
students formally confront the concept of density. 
At this level they recognize that large objects can be 
lightweight and small objects can be heavyweight, 
depending on the relationship of the mass to the vol-
ume of the object. The higher the mass to volume ra-
tio, the greater the density of the substance or object. 
A snowball has a low density compared to a piece of 
granite or marble. A small box with a volume of 1 liter 
can weigh either 10 grams or 1,000 grams, depending 
on whether it is full of packing peanuts or sand. Expe-
rience with objects of different sizes and weights will 
help older elementary students understand density. 
The problem cards in Figure 18.20 suggest recording 
Figure 18.19 Problem cards
for weight
WEIGHING WITH GRAMS
Use the balance scale and weights to answer the following questions in your journal.
1.  What is the weight in grams of the apple?
2.  What is the weight in grams of three carrots?
3.  What is the weight in grams of six walnuts?
WEIGHING WITH KILOGRAMS
Use the spring scale and the bathroom scale to answer each question in your journal.
1.  How many kilograms does the bag of carrots weigh?
2.  How many kilograms do ten mathematics books weigh?
3.  How many kilograms does the bag of dried beans weigh?
4.  How many kilograms does the box of paper weigh?
Compare your answers with those of another group of students. If there are any 
disagreements, reweigh the objects involved to see if one group was wrong. Could a 
difference be the result of the way each group interpreted the measurements, rather 
than an error?

MISCONCEPTION
A common error that 
students make is to 
relate the side lengths 
of an angle to its degree 
measure. Activity 18.24 
helps students to dismiss 
this idea. As with other 
measurement concepts, 
a benchmark for angle 
measurement is beneﬁ cial 
to students. Activity 18.25 
helps students to establish

angle measure.
volume and weight measurements in a table. The 
table shows the relationship between the two mea-
sures and connects measurement to division and 
algebraic representation. Students can create their 
own density boxes to add to the collection of boxes 
for weighing and measuring.
Expanding Angle Concepts
The formal introduction to measuring angles will 
likely come in a geometry lesson when children 
learn that an angle is formed by two rays that have 
a common endpoint. One way to introduce the 
measuring process in intermediate grades is to have 
children make folds in wax paper to compare angles 
(Activity 18.22). Discussion during the activity leads 
children to realize that a new sort of unit, the degree, 
is needed to measure angles. One way to develop the 
meaning of a degree is shown in Activity 18.23.
After students understand the basis for measur-
ing angles, teachers can introduce the standard 
protractor. The teacher demonstrates its use with a 
large protractor at the chalkboard or with a clear 

ACTIVITY 18.23
 
What Is a Degree?
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Whole class or small group
Objective: Students deﬁ ne degree as a measure of angularity.
Materials: Rotating ray for overhead projector
•  Show the model of a rotating ray with an overhead 
projector.
•  Ask the children to follow the ray as it rotates around the 
endpoint. Imagine a ray that is rotated around its end-
point so that it makes a quarter-turn, a half-turn, and a 
complete rotation.
•  Say: “If this ray were the minute hand of a clock, how 
many minutes would it pass as it made a complete rota-
tion?” (Answer: 60 minutes.) “As the ray moves around 
the circle, it makes 360 stops. What part of the entire 
circle is the distance between each pair of stops?” 
(Answer: 1
360.)
•  Point out the angle made by the ray and the dashed line.
•  Say: “The angle formed by the ray and the dashed line is 
1 degree of measure. Each degree is 1
360 of a full rotation 
of the ray.”
•  Model a full rotation, and ask students how many degrees 
the ray has turned.
•  Ask: “How many degrees are in one quarter turn?” 
(Answer: 90 degrees.) “How many degrees are in half a 
turn?” (Answer: 180 degrees.)

Measuring Angles
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Student pairs
Objective: Students represent and compare angles.
Materials: Two pieces of wax paper for each student, scissors
•  Have each student fold each sheet of wax paper so that 
the common endpoint of two rays are at one edge of the 
paper. The folds form one angle on each sheet.
•  Have students lay one sheet on top of the other so that 
the endpoint and one ray of the smaller angle are super-
imposed on the endpoint and one ray of the larger angle.
•  Have students estimate the number of times the smaller 
angle will ﬁ t inside the larger angle. Describe the relation-
ship as “The larger angle is less than twice as large,” “The 
larger angle is about twice as large,” or “The larger angle 
is more than twice as large.”
•  Have students cut out the smaller angle to make a unit 
of measure. After measuring and recording the number 
of times the smaller angle ﬁ ts into the larger angle, have 
pairs of students trade their smaller angles and measure 
their larger angles with the new unit angle.
•  Have students display and discuss their angle measures.
•  Is the measure with the two angles the same? If not, why 
not?
•  When you measure using a smaller angle, is the measure 
of the large angle a bigger or a smaller number than 
when you measure with a larger angle?
•  Which gives a more precise measurement, a smaller angle 
or a larger angle?

Angle Wheel (Representation)

•  Explain to 
students that 
you will display 
an angle on the 
angle wheel 
and that you 
want them 
to estimate 
its number of 
degrees. Tell 
students that 
every angle 
shown will be a 
multiple of 10.
•  Show an angle, and ask a student for its degree measure.
•  Continue to ask students for the degree measure until 
a student is within 10. At that point, give the correct 
number of degrees.
•  Form another angle and repeat, but move through 
student estimates quickly. If a student has an incorrect 
measure, do not dwell on the incorrect answer. Simply 
repeat the given measure and quickly move on to 
another student until a student gives the correct answer 
(within 10).
•  After repeating with a number of angles, ask students 
how they would distinguish between a 50 angle and a 
140 angle on the angle wheel. Probe for using 90° as a 
benchmark.

each pie plate, and 
distribute two plates 
per group.
•  Have each student 
cut out an angle 
from a pie plate.
•  Have students trace their pie plate angles.
•  Ask students to cut down their angle by shortening the 
side lengths and compare the remaining angle to the 
traced angle.
•  Repeat for several more cuttings.
•  Have each group make a conjecture about the size of an 
angle and the lengths of the sides of an angle.
scales, unsure whether the correct reading for this 
angle is 60 or 120. Instead of making a set of rules 
to apply to reading the protractor, students can use 
a benchmark of 90 (see Activity 18.25) to determine 
that this angle is less than 90, so its measure is 60, 
not 120. Students can measure angles on objects, 
in magazine pictures, or drawn and duplicated on 
paper. Monitor students as they use the protractors 
to help those who have problems and to extend the 
thinking and skill of all students.

Older children apply their knowledge of mea-

One way to assess students’ understanding is 
with an end-of unit performance task. On the com-
panion website two activities with scoring rubrics 
are presented as ways to assess students’ under-
E
standing of volume. The box-making activity can be 
used to determine a student’s understanding of vol-
ume. The school-volume group activity can be used 
as a culminating activity to assess an individual’s 
understanding of volume measurement. Group proj-
ects can be assessed for quality of presentation and 
cooperation and should not be used for assigning 
grades. Students might do self-assessment on the 
group project. In Chapter 4 we discussed the devel-
opment of performance tasks and rubrics to assess 
students’ understanding.
Expanding Temperature Concepts
Older children explore applications of temperature 
in both Fahrenheit and centigrade (Celsius). To keep 
a daily temperature record, children can use large, 
easy-to-read thermometers and digital weather ther-
mometers. A large demonstration thermometer, ei-
ther commercially bought or made with tagboard 
and elastic, models how liquid in the thermometer 
moves up and down and is read on the Fahrenheit

Elicit comments why this is so.
•  Challenge students to design a better calendar that has all 
months the same length.
•  Remind students that they should plan on a 365-day

outside temperature, the child can set the tempera-
ture on the demonstration thermometer for the en-
tire class to read. A line graph of daily temperatures 
provides a record for discussion of increasing or de-
creasing temperatures over the month and connects 
mathematics and science in a realistic context.
Other science and health units also engage 
children in experiences with measurement of tem-
perature. Plant experiments require that variables 
such as temperature, light, water, and nutrients be 
controlled and measured to determine their effects. 
Temperatures of warm- and cold-blooded animals 
can be considered during the study of animals. Tem-
perature related to health is important to know and 
understand.
By the end of elementary school, children should 
know how to read both Celsius and Fahrenheit liq-
uid and digital thermometers. Rather than spending 
time on conversions, students need to know that the 
boiling point of water is 212F, or 100C, and that the 
freezing point is 32F, or 0C. These two facts allow 
them to estimate and interpolate common tempera-
tures such as hot, cold, and comfortable.
Extending Concepts of Time
As older children progress in their understanding of 
our calendar, they begin to learn the number of days 
in each month. One way that children can recall the 
number of days in each month is to use their knuck-
les. If children hold up their hands as shown here, 
then the months can be counted off in order as ei-
ther a “knuckle month” or a “space month.” Knuckle 
months all have 31 days. Space months all have 30, 
with the exception of Feb ru ary, which has 28 days 
in non– leap years. Notice that with this model, there 
is one pair of consecutive knuckle months. These 
months correspond to July and Au gust.
January
February
July
August
Older students can expand their understanding 
of time by examining time in different settings. They 
can explore the origins of our Gregorian calendar to 
determine why our calendar is named after a pope, 
and what events led to the present calendar after 
more than 1,500 years of the ancient Roman (Julian) 
calendar.
Older students can also explore the effect of time 
zones on travel. Airline schedules suggest that an 
airplane leaving Boston at 7 a.m. and landing in Los 
Angeles at 10:00 a.m. requires only 3 hours to make 
the transcontinental trip. Of course, the travel time 
is longer because there are time zones to consider, 
and students can grapple with this aspect of time.
Another topic for older children is the 24-hour 
clock. Students in your class from cultures and 
countries that use a 24-hour clock can explain how 
they were able to tell time. A ﬁ nal topic is suggested 
in Activity 18.26. Our present calendar with months 
A simple but reasonably accurate method for converting 
temperate Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit is to double 
the Celsius temperature and add 30. A reading of 20C is 
approximately 70F.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Standardized time zones were developed when railroad travel 
across the United States came about with the completion 
of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. In order for railroad 
companies to prepare and print meaningful time schedules, 
standardized time zones across the country were needed. Be-
fore 1869, each locale could have its own ofﬁ cial time. The city 
of Chicago alone, for example, had six different time zones.
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
An excellent multicultural activity is for students to examine 
the calendars of different cultures of the past and present: 
the Julian calendar of ancient Rome, the Mayan and Aztec 
calendars, and the lunar calendars of present-day and early 
peoples can be a fascinating study.

that have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days strikes some as too 
confusing. There are many movements to rede-
sign our calendar to make all the months the same

their own revision.
allow students to personalize and expand measure-
ment activities that particularly intrigue them:
•  Measure the length and width of one room in 
your house or apartment.
•  Look in the newspaper for carpet ads. Measure 
a room, and ﬁ gure out how much it would cost 
to cover the ﬂ oor with three different qualities of 
carpeting.
•  Find a recipe for, and bake, some oatmeal and 
raisin cookies.
•  Weigh ﬁ ve different pairs of shoes. Which weighs 
the most? the least?
•  When are the heaviest shoes worn? When are the 
lightest shoes worn?
•  Some people say that 98.6F is a normal tempera-
ture for a healthy person. Take the temperatures 
of ﬁ ve people who are not sick and compare 
them to the “normal” temperature.
•  Keep a 24-hour diary of your time. How much 
time do you spend doing various activities?
•  Take a survey of allowances in your class. What 
do other students spend money on each week?
•  Determine how many gallons of paint are needed 
to paint the walls of two classrooms.
•  Predict how many gallons of milk are consumed 
in the school cafeteria during lunch.
Measurement Problem Solving 
and Projects
Measurement situations abound, so it is easy to ﬁ nd 
projects and problem-solving applications that re-
quire measurement. Task cards can be used to extend 
measurement activities outside school. Task cards 

Take-Home Activities
Measurements are frequently made at home. One 
take-home activity is a measurement treasure 
hunt; the other has students consider questions 
dealing with heights of family members. Units of 
measure for the treasure hunt should be conﬁ ned 
to ones that children have learned in school. A 
treasure list of units for older students will be more 
comprehensive than that for younger ones. We 
use English units for measurements in our example 
because these are the ones most commonly used at 
home.
Our Measurements-at-Home Hunt
Dear Parent:
Your child has been learning about measurement. We want you to help her or 
him ﬁ nd examples of measurements at home. Please take time to assist your 
child to complete the following work. He or she is to ﬁ nd things around the 
house whose measures match as nearly as possible the ones on the list. Here 
are examples: Find something that is about 7 inches long. What takes about 
1 hour to complete?
If you cannot ﬁ nd a match for any item on the list, make a match that is as 
close as possible:
7 inches 
4 yards 
1 pound
5 pounds 
5 ounces 
3 minutes
1 hour 
1 gallon 
59 cents
90 degrees (angle) 
350 degrees (temperature)
•  Have your child make a list of the measurements and the thing (or things) 
that matches each one.
•  Have your child write a brief description of how you completed your trea-
sure hunt. Which measurement was easiest to match? Which measurement 
was the most difﬁ cult to match?
•  Have your child return the completed paper to school on Wednesday.

Summary
Children learn about measurement by measuring real 
objects in everyday contexts. In elementary mathemat-
ics, teachers develop the concepts and practical skills 
of measuring length, area, volume and capacity, weight 
(mass), angles, temperature, time, and money. Measure-
ment activities build an understanding of the nature of 
measurement and units, present the units used to mea-
sure objects and events, and cultivate skills with mea-
surement tools and instruments.
While engaged in many measurement activities, stu-
dents discover that measurement is always approximate, 
not exact; measurement can always be made more pre-
cise by using smaller units. Human error creates inac-
curacies in measurement. Students learn to choose ap-
propriate measuring units and tools for different jobs; a 
ruler is good for measuring human height but not good 
for measuring a football ﬁ eld or a mile.
Skill with both English customary and metric units 
and tools is important in elementary school. The English 
customary system is currently entrenched in daily life 
in the United States, but the metric system is used virtu-
ally everywhere else in the world in everyday life and in 
science and commerce. The metric system is a simple 
scientiﬁ c system in which all units are derived from the 
length of the meter. Units for area, volume, and mass are 
related to the meter and to each other based on powers 
of 10, like the decimal numeration system.
For each measurement characteristic, children be-
gin with concrete experiences in realistic situations. As 
children learn about the units and tools in both systems 
of measurement, they see that the same process is used 
for both systems but that the units are different. Through 
many measuring experiences they develop mental mod-
els for common units that they can use for estimation. 
Older children extend their knowledge about measure-
ment to include area, volume, and angle measure. They 
also learn how to compute measurements such as area 
and volume.
Measurement activities have many direct connec-
tions to other subject areas and home activities. Health, 
science, and social studies concepts relate to measure-
ment of length, area, volume, temperature, time, and 
money. These measurements are also vital at home for 
planning and making decisions about health, cooking, 
decorating, purchasing, and scheduling activities. The 
problem-solving and realistic nature of measurement 
and the fact that many measurement activities can be car-
ried out independently or in groups make measurement 
an excellent mathematics topic to be taught throughout 
the year. Teachers can prepare and introduce task cards, 
learning centers, and take-home activities.
Through guided discussion and debrieﬁ ng of ex-
periences, children grasp the concepts and skills of 
measurement.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  What are your experiences with learning the metric 
system? Did you learn about the metric system 
through hands-on measurement activities?
 2.  Can you estimate lengths of a yard, inch, centimeter, 
meter, and mile? square foot, square yard, square 
meter? cubic foot, cubic centimeter? ounce, pound, 
gram, kilogram? Name common objects that would 
be good referents for these units.
 3.  In an age of digital clocks, should children learn to 
tell time with analog clocks? Discuss this question 
with two or three acquaintances. What is the con-
sensus, and what reasons are given?
 4.  Search the Internet for websites on measuring 
instruments and processes. Report on what you 
ﬁ nd at three websites on measurement. Several 
manufacturers of measuring instruments have sites 
about their products. One manufacturer describes a 
distance-measuring device that is accurate to 
1 foot in a mile. The National Institute for Standards 
and Technology maintains a site (“A Walk Through 
Time,” available at http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/
Time/time.html) that chronicles the history of time-
keeping and time measurement. Another website 
(http://www.fraden.com) describes the inventor of the 
Instant Ear Thermometer.
 5.  Explain how many cubic feet make a cubic yard.
 6.  Give a convincing argument for using the metric sys-
tem rather than the English system of measurement.
 7.  Interview a 5- to 7-year-old child. Ask her to use a 
coffee stirrer to measure the length of her foot and 
your foot, and then compare the results.
 8.  Explain how the value of p is determined.

Using Children’s Literature
Myllar, Rolf. (1991). How big is a foot? New York: Dell. 
(Grades K– 3)
How Big Is a Foot? is the story of a carpenter and the 
dilemma of making a new bed for the queen. The bed 
was measured by the king and by the carpenter’s ap-
prentice, but because their feet were not the same size, 
the bed was built too small for the queen.
 
This story line sets the stage for measurement of 
lengths by students’ feet.
•  Students pace off the width of the room or the length 
of the chalkboard and write the results on a chart in 
Vanessa feet, Jen feet, Anwar feet, and Domingo feet.
•  Have students post their data.
•  Ask if anyone got an exact number of foot lengths.
•  Discuss the reasons for different numbers of foot 
lengths.
•  Ask if a giant or a mouse would need more or fewer 
foot lengths.
The discussion of these points brings up the need for 
a standard “foot” that everybody understands. Cheryl 
Lubinski and Diane Thiessen (1996) describe how one 
teacher develops these ideas over several weeks using 
children’s literature as a basis for measurement, prob-
lem solving, and writing.
Burns, Marilyn. (1978). This book is about time. New 
York: Little, Brown. (Grades 4– 6)
Want activities to stir children’s interest in a unit on 
time? Want activities dealing with the history of time 
and timepieces? This book about time includes nearly 
all aspects of time—from evolution of the calendar to 
people’s natural rhythms, from a history of timepieces 
and calendars to jet lag and “time clocks” in plants and 
animals. Chapter titles indicate the variety of topics: 
“Warm-Up Time,” “It’s Not the Same Time Everywhere,” 
“Ticking Off the Day,” “Portable Time,” “Bits of Time,” 
“The Calendar Story,” “Nature’s Amazing Clocks,” “The 
Inside Story of People Time,” “What Is Jet Lag?” and 
“Time in Your Life.”
•  Have students do their own time-check count. When 
do they look at their watches or clocks? Why do they 
look at them? (p. 10)
•  Try making a list of time expressions: “Time’s up.” 
“Time ﬂ ies.” “Time on my hands.” How many can you 
think of? (p. 12)
•  Which civilizations made and used sundials? water 
clocks? sand clocks? How can children make these 
timepieces? (pp. 30– 37)
•  Have students study different types of calendars. Infor-
mation in “The Calendar Story” may inspire children 
to do research in an encyclopedia or other sources.
•  Have students identify connections between time and 
science that are evident in natural cycles, in the sea-
sons, in animal migrations, and in sleep-wake cycles.
All activities are suitable for ﬁ fth- and sixth-graders who 
are able to read and interpret information and direc-
tions. However, many activities are suitable for younger 
children when adapted and presented by a teacher.

Understanding 
and 
Representing 
Concepts of Data
n understanding of how information is collected, recorded, 
reported, and interpreted is essential for citizens in 
their daily lives. Numerical information can describe 
current events or opinions and forecast future events. 
Every day, newspapers, magazines, television, and 
Internet sites feature stories with numerical information sum-
marized in averages and percentages and displayed in tables and graphs. 
Personal ﬁ nance decisions about homes, jobs, savings, and purchases as 
well as voting on candidates and public policy depend on understanding 
data. An adult who cannot interpret graphical displays of data is effectively 
disenfranchised in matters of the national economy. Data organization and 
interpretation provide many experiences that develop and extend skills in 
problem solving, reasoning, communication, connections, and representa-
tions of mathematics.
In this chapter you will read about:
1  How students collect and organize data based on their experiences
2  Activities that help students learn how to make and analyze tables, 
line plots, picture graphs, bar graphs, line graphs, circle graphs, 
stem-and-leaf plots, and box-and-whisker plots
3  How computer graphing programs can be used to organize and 
analyze data

CHAPTER 19

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Early work with data should be exploratory in na-
ture and center around children’s ﬁ rsthand observa-
tions. The teacher ﬁ rst guides the collection of data 
and then introduces increasingly more sophisti-
cated ways to organize and display them. Over time 
the teacher expands instruction to include differ-
ent types of graphs. By the end of grade 6 students 
should be able to construct and interpret picture, 
bar, line, and circle graphs, stem-and-leaf-plots, and 
box-and-whisker plots.
NCTM Correlation
The Data Standards for Pre-K– 2 are as follows:
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 
12 should enable all students to:
•  Formulate questions that can be addressed with data 
and collect, organize, and display relevant data to answer 
them
•  Select and use appropriate statistical methods to analyze 
data
•  Develop and evaluate inferences and predictions that are 
based on data
•  Understand and apply basic concepts of probability
Pre-K– 2 Expectations
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  pose questions and gather data about themselves and 
their surroundings;
•  sort and classify objects according to their attributes and 
organize data about the objects;
•  represent data using concrete objects, pictures, and 
graphs;
•  describe parts of the data and the set of data as a whole 
to determine what the data show.
Data Collection
The data children collect should come from their 
real-life interests and activities. Many childhood ac-
tivities provide data that students can organize in 
tables and graphs. In kindergarten and the primary 
grades children can gather information about birth-
days; shoe sizes, types, and colors; means of getting 
to school; height; hair and eye colors; favorite foods; 
and television shows. Intermediate-grade students 
are interested in many of the same topics and can 
add, for example, favorite sports stars, clothing, 
video games, and performing artists.
Recording and organizing data from science and 
social studies topics provides rich opportunities for 
integrating mathematics into other areas of the cur-
riculum. The study of weather is common in both 
primary and intermediate science classes. Primary-
grade children can collect temperature and rainfall 
information and record it in tables and graphs. In 
later grades the study can move beyond recording 
the data to interpreting it. While conducting experi-
ments in plant growth, students can record daily or 
weekly measurements.
Children can determine the strengths of various 
magnets by the number of paper clips they lift. In 
social studies, tables and graphs of varying formats 
can be made to compare products, populations, or 
geographic sizes of states or countries. Reference 
books, in both print and CD-ROM formats, and Inter-
net sites provide a variety of data sources. Whenever 
possible, the data collected should be related to the 
interests of the children so that their data-handling 
skills produce information that is important to them. 
Sometimes data will be collected and organized in 
a single class period. In other cases several days 
or weeks will be devoted to the collection, organi-
zation, and interpretation of data for a science or 
social studies unit. Whatever the time frame, deci-
sions must be made before the data are collected. 
The following ﬁ ve questions frame any meaningful 
collection and display of data:
•  What is the question that justiﬁ es the data 
collection?
•  What information is needed to answer the 
question?
•  How can the information be gathered?

MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
Data for graphs and surveys can be drawn from many differ-
ent sources, including foreign countries and cultures that are 
important to students in the classroom. Demographic data, 
economic changes, results of athletic events, and the like 
could be used.

•  How can the information be organized and 
analyzed?
•  What are the best ways to display and communi-
cate the results or analysis?
Materials for constructing tables and graphs are 
readily available and inexpensive. Sheets of news-
print and centimeter- or inch-squared paper (see 
Black-Line Masters 19.1 and 19.2), colored cubes, pic-
ture stickers, compasses, protractors, and pens and 
markers are the materials children use to construct 
tables and graphs. Computer programs suitable 
for both primary- and intermediate-grade students 
provide ways to organize data with spreadsheets 
(tables) and graphs. A number of Internet sites dis-
play submitted data in a 
variety of representations, 
both graphical and tabu-
lar. By the end of grade 
school students should 
demonstrate their ability 
to use both student-made 
and computer-generated 
tables and graphs to orga-
nize and report data.
What Teachers Should Know 
About Understanding and 
Representing Concepts of Data
The key reason for representing data is to make 
the data easily understood. It is important that chil-
dren focus on representing the data meaningfully 
and not simply follow a procedure for producing a 
graph of the data. Accordingly, students should have 
many experiences with representing data in various 
forms, such as line, bar, and circle graphs, stem-and-
leaf plots, and box-and-whisker plots. They should 
also have many opportunities to interpret these 
graphical representations of data so that they gain 
an understanding of how various representations 
can convey information.
Data that students represent should be engag-
ing. Data gathered from schoolmates, family, and 
the community can be especially interesting to stu-
dents. Additional sources of data are periodicals 
and the Internet.
Each measure of central tendency (mean, me-
dian, mode) has advantages and disadvantages. 
In addition to computing these measures, students 
should understand the proper use of each measure 
and what information each conveys.
Teachers sometimes spend more time on col-
lecting and displaying data than on analyzing and 
interpreting data. Data are useful when they are 
used to answer questions. Teaching children to 
gather and organize data is important, but from the 
beginning of work with tables and graphs, children 
should generate and answer simple questions as 
they gather data.
What color are your eyes?
How many pockets do you have?
How many letters are in your ﬁ rst name?
After collecting individual answers, students will be 
able to organize their data for meaningful display in 
tables and graphs, and analysis will be easier. Re-
sults are then categorized, and different questions 
can be formulated from the data collected from all 
the children who answered the original questions.
What color are the eyes of people in the class?
How many pockets do different people have?
What is the most frequent number of letters in ﬁ rst 
names?
Students work with topics that are important to 
them in life: birthdays, pets, families, foods, and so 
on. Data that are pertinent to students engage them 
in gathering data to answer important questions. 
Students with many experiences in analyzing data 
build a foundation for more sophisticated represen-
tation and interpretation of information in the inter-
mediate grades.
Organizing Data in Tables
At the earliest levels children recognize that some 
ways of recording data allow them to interpret the 
data more quickly and accurately. A simple way to 
record straightforward data is with a tally system. 
Tally systems are among the earliest methods used 
by ancient peoples to record data, such as the num-
ber of animals in a herd or the number of game 
animals captured during a hunting season. In the 
tally shown here, Kimberly, a ﬁ rst-grade student, re-
corded the number of windows in her home. Note 
that Kimberly separated her tallies into groups of ﬁ ve 
with a cross tally at every ﬁ fth window she counted. 

492 
Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Kimberly can easily count up the total number of 
windows as she goes along or at the end by skip-
counting by ﬁ ves.
Even in the primary grades students encounter 
problems with data gathering that require them to 
improve their process. If they ask about favorite ice 
cream ﬂ avors, they may get 12 different answers 
from 18 children. As a result, they may decide to re-
frame their question: “Which one of the six kinds 
of ice cream is your favorite?” Whitin (2006) makes 
several suggestions to help students reframe their 
questions:
1.  How were the categories chosen?
2.  What will happen to data that do not fall into the 
chosen categories?
3.  What categories were rejected?
4.  What other categories could have been created?
From the earliest grades children learn that using 
a table to organize data is a basic problem-solving 
strategy. Data organized in this way allow students 
to handle and communicate numerical information 
in meaningful ways. Data for young children need 
to come from ﬁ rsthand experiences. The shoes chil-
dren wear to school can provide data for a ﬁ rst ac-
tivity. Children can gather on the ﬂ oor, remove one 
shoe, and place it in the center of their circle. Discus-
sion about the different types of shoes leads to a clas-
siﬁ cation scheme. Once the shoes have been sorted 
according to the children’s classiﬁ cation scheme, a 
natural extension of the activity is to make a table to 
show the number of shoes in each category (Figure 
19.1). Children’s pets, actual or wished for, can be 
subjects, ﬁ rst for tables and then for graphs. A sur-
vey in one class of ﬁ rst-graders resulted in the table 
in Figure 19.2.
Information from tables such as these can be 
represented graphically, even by young children, in 
a line plot. A line plot simply represents each item 
of data as an individual entry. In Figure 19.3 the data 
from Figure 19.1 are displayed in a line plot. Such a 
display is fairly simple for students to construct.
Once the columns are labeled to show the cat-
egories, students record each item in the line plot 
with a mark in the appropriate column. Figure 19.4 
illustrates a difﬁ culty that some students have with 
line plots. Autumn, a second-grader, had difﬁ culty 
marking the X in each column. She could not make 
each X the same size, and the spaces between the 
Xs are not consistent. It appears that there are many 
more pairs of athletic shoes than leather shoes, 
when the difference is only one pair. In this instance 
students in the class were able to discern that some-
thing was wrong with the plot. They reasoned that 
because there are eight pairs of athletic shoes and 
seven pairs of leather shoes, the columns for these 
types of shoes should be nearly the same height. 
One way to help students avoid this common error 
is to provide graph or grid paper and be sure that 
students place one X in each block or square.
Figure 19.5 shows how Autumn recorded the 
same information with the help of a grid. Notice how 
the columns now more closely reﬂ ect the actual 
numbers of pairs of shoes. Note, too, that the line 
plot resembles a bar graph when it is drawn within 
a grid. The transition from line plots to bar graphs 
is a fairly easy one for children to make when they 
have had ample opportunities to build and interpret 
line plots. They make the transition to bar graph by 
coloring in squares of the same color to make a con-
tinuous bar. Now, instead of counting squares, they

refer to the index number-line scale for the quantity 
that the bar graph represents.
Children use tables and graphs to identify pat-
terns and functions. Activities leading to an intuitive 
understanding of function develop from situations 
using the relationship between two sets of numbers. 
During a fund-raising activity in a third-grade class, 
students studied the cost of toys they would use as 
prizes for their school carnival booth; each toy they 
chose cost 13 cents. When Claris suggested that they 
put ﬁ ve toys in one box as a superprize, they won-
dered how much ﬁ ve toys would cost. The teacher 
made a simple rate table. He began by making a 
blank table with the labels “Toys” and “Cost.” Then 
he asked, “If we don’t buy any toys, how much will 
we spend?” “If we buy one toy, how much will we 
spend?” As questions were asked, the teacher ﬁ lled 
the boxes in the table (Figure 19.6). Gradually, chil-
dren saw that they could get the next number by 
adding 13 to the preceding number. As the children 
studied the table, some reasoned that it was really 
a multiplication table for 13. They saw the relation-
ship between the two numbers and realized that the 
number in each lower cell was the product of the 
number in the cell above it and 13.

The organization of data in a table often results 
in the solution to a problem. Activity 19.1 suggests 
investigations that involve older children in deter-
mining the number of blocks in a pyramid. Orga-
nizing data in tables is one problem-solving strategy 

for this activity. The teacher’s role in these investiga-
tions is to encourage children to raise and discuss 
questions, to look for patterns, and to express solu-
tions in words, with models, and with mathematical 
symbols.
Object and Picture Graphs
Young children’s ﬁ rst graphs can be used to extend 
ongoing activities. After children have sorted and 
organized the shoe data in a table, the teacher can 
make a simple line plot to show the number of shoes 
in each category. Now children are ready for addi-
tional ways to organize and communicate their data. 
Another simple graph for the shoe data can be an 
object graph, in which actual objects, in this case 
the shoes, are part of the graph. An object graph can 
also use life-size representations of the objects in-
stead of the actual objects themselves to display the 
data in a graph. (In this instance, this object graph 
could be considered a picture graph.) Each child 
gets a sheet of 81
2  11 colored construction paper, 
color coded according to type of shoes—blue for 
boots, red for sandals, and so on. Have students 
trace the appropriate shoe onto the colored paper. 
A length of masking tape on the classroom ﬂ oor can 
serve as the graph’s base. Each child puts a piece of 
paper with the tracing of a shoe on the ﬂ oor, begin-
ning at the baseline. All children with a like color 
of paper place their “shoes” in the same row. The 
teacher helps them avoid overlapping pieces of pa-
per or leaving large gaps between papers. Once the 
graph is complete, the children count the number of 
shoes of each kind and make comparisons among 
the categories (Figure 19.7).
Next, students can make a picture graph to give 
a more permanent representation of the data. A pic-
ture graph uses drawings or pictures to represent 
ACTIVITY 19.1
 
Picture Graph (Representation)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students read and interpret an object graph and a 
picture graph.
Materials: Plastic animals, animal stickers portraying the same 
animals, two large pieces of poster board
•  On each poster board, make a vertical line to serve as a 
baseline about 9 inches from the left edge.
•  Have children sit in a circle on the ﬂ oor, with a poster 
board in the middle. Show the table made when data on 
pets were collected (see Figure 19.2).
•  Ask children, one by one, to name the type of pet(s) they 
own. Give the children plastic animals to match their pets. 
Children with more than one pet will get more than one 
animal. Have a unique “character” for children with no 
pet. Now, one by one, have the children put their animals 
on the poster board. Have the children put their animals 
in the appropriate places. Have them use care to align 
the animals at the baseline and across the poster board in 
rows.
•  Use the object graph as a source of information for 
answers to questions: “Which lines are shortest?” “Are 
there any rows that have the same number of animals in 
them?” “Which pet would you say is most popular in our 
class?”
•  Give each child a sticker to match her or his pet. Talk 
about how they will use the stickers to make a picture 
graph. Stress the importance of having a good alignment 
of stickers at the baseline and across the rows. Raise ques-
tions about data in this graph. Talk about the advantage 
of the picture graph over the object graph (e.g., it can be 
kept, whereas the object graph is temporary).

the actual objects in the data set. In a picture graph 
each picture can represent one or more actual data 
objects. In this case the pictures are not life-size, as 
in the previous graph. Each child draws a picture of 
a shoe on square sticky notes. Each square is dis-
played with similar cards, beginning at a baseline 
drawn on craft paper. The teacher helps the children 
see that the object graph and the picture graph con-
tain identical information in different forms. In both 
types of graphs, as with the tally system and the line 
plot, each item of data is represented by a single 
mark, symbol, or picture. This one-to-one relation-
ship between the actual items and their graphical 
representations as symbols or pictures is critical for 
young children. Activity 19.1 presents other ways for 
children to prepare object and picture graphs. Data 
from the pet survey are used for these graphs.
Object and picture graphs have limitations that 
make them impractical for depicting some kinds of 
data. When real shoes and blocks are stacked to rep-
resent the shoe counting activity or the pet counting 
activity, the large number of objects needed makes 
it obvious that this is not a useful way to represent 
these data. Picture graphs of the same data are im-
practical for the same reason. Object graphs are not 
useful for portraying data dealing with large num-
bers, such as the populations of the 12 largest cit-
ies in the world (see Figure 19.8). A picture graph 
can be used if a single picture is used to represent a 
large number of people; one symbol, such as a stick 
ﬁ gure, might represent 10,000, 100,000, or 1 million 
people in a population graph. In the picture graph 
shown in Figure 19.8, each symbol represents 1 mil-
lion people. Such picture graphs are appropriate for 
children in grade 3 and beyond. Older students can 
use picture graphs to display city and state popula-
tions of the United States in a similar fashion to how 
we display the populations of the 12 largest cities 
in the world in this chapter. Of course, they begin 
with simpler data representations, such as a single 
bicycle image to represent ﬁ ve bicycles.
Bar Graphs
Children who have made and interpreted object 
graphs, picture graphs, and line plots have little dif-
ﬁ culty making and interpreting bar graphs. A bar 
graph is a graphical representation of numerical 
data that uses vertical or horizontal bars. As with the 
other kinds of graphs, bar graphs are used to display 
categorical data. Activity 19.2 explores some transi-
tional stages between line plots or picture graphs 
and bar graphs. Younger children could paste 
squares of colored paper onto grid paper to make a 
simple bar graph. In a similar fashion children can

use Uniﬁ x cubes to form a similar bar graph. In both 
cases each individual square or cube represents 
an individual pair of shoes. The squares or cubes 
are in a one-to-one correspondence with the pairs 
of shoes. The ﬁ nal transition to a bar graph shows 
the same data but without individual items making 
up the graph. None of the bars is divided into indi-
vidual squares or cubes. Activity 19.3 reverses the 
process. In this activity a completed bar graph is 
provided and children are challenged to provide

•  Begin by displaying the table of shoe types (see Fig -
ure 19.1).
•  Review the data in the table.
•  Remind the children of the graph they made with squares 
of paper and their shoes. Show the shoe picture graph.
•  Tell the children that other kinds of graphs can be used to 
show the same information. This time, colored cubes will 
be used to represent their shoes. Children with each type 
of shoe will have cubes of the same color. Have children 
with the same colors join their cubes and stand them on 
a table alongside the other colors. Compare the standing 
cubes with the table and the picture graph. Discuss the 
meaning of the cubes in each stack. Help children rec-
ognize that the table, the picture graph, and the colored 
cube “graph” all represent the shoes.
•  Give each child a 4-inch square of poster board with a 
color that matches the colored cube used earlier. Have 
students paste the squares onto the large sheet of poster 
board, which should have a baseline about 1 foot from 
the bottom. Name each column in the space beneath the 
baseline. Discuss how this graph is like the picture graph 
and how it is different.
•  Compare the colored-squares graph with the colored-cube 
graph. Tell the children that the new graph is a bar graph.

Statistics
Data are often represented in visual form in tables 
and graphs. Statistics are tools for describing, sum-
marizing, and interpreting data that enable students 
to capture important characteristics of data numeri-
cally. Statistical language begins with early graphs 
when children discuss the data in terms of the most, 
the least, the middle, and end points of the data. 
Informal language and discussion provide a founda-
tion for statistical concepts and terms such as mode, 
median, mean, and range.
E
When students con -
duct surveys to collect 
information, they ask two 
kinds of questions: ques-
tions with word answers 
that ﬁ t the different cat-
egories of the survey and 
questions with number 
answers. A ﬁ rst lesson in 
statistics should help chil-
dren recognize the differ-
ence between these two 
kinds of questions and 
answers. The way informa-
tion is described is based 
on the kind of informa-
tion that was collected: 
categorical or numerical. Questions with word, or 
category, answers include:
•  What is your favorite kind of pizza? (pepperoni, 
mushroom, or cheese)
•  What pet would you like to have? (horse, cat, or 
ﬁ sh)
•  What kind of shoes are you wearing? (dress, blue, 
or leather)
Questions with number answers might include:
•  What is the height of each student in the ﬁ fth-
grade class? (45 inches, 49 inches, . . . , 64 inches)
•  How many brothers and sisters do you have? (0, 1, 
2, . . . , 6)

•  What was your highest score in the game of 
Yahtzee? (193, 250, or 394)
Three measures of central tendency—mean, me-
dian, and mode—are different ways to summarize a 
set of data. The mean and the median of a set of data 
are topics for intermediate students, and we discuss 
them later in this chapter. Younger children are usu-
ally interested in the mode because it is the most 
frequent value.
•  Athletic shoes are worn by the largest number of 
students—12 out of 25.
•  More students have cats than any other pet—
9 cats.
•  Seven students have six letters and seven students 
have eight letters in their ﬁ rst name; six and eight 
letters are the most.
The term mode describes both categorical and 
numerical information and provides the answer to 
questions about both types of information:
•  What is the most common height of students in 
the ﬁ fth-grade class? Look at the table, or bar 
graph of student heights to determine the mode.
•  Which type of shoes did more children wear? 
How many wore that type? Eight children wore 
athletic shoes, ﬁ ve wore cloth, seven wore 
leather, three wore sandals, and two wore boots 
(see Figure 19.1). What is the mode of this set?
•  Which kind of pet did most children have? Two 
children had a horse, six had a cat, two had a 
ﬁ sh, seven had a dog, two had a mouse, one had 
a guinea pig, one had a turtle, and three had no 
pet (see Figure 19.2).
Some sets of data have more than one mode. The 
following data set lists the number of telephones in 
students’ homes in a second-grade class: 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 
4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2. Both 2 and 3 are modes 
for this set of data. When there are two modes for a 
set of data, the two values are bimodal. Conversely, 
some data sets have no mode, as the data for the 
world’s 12 largest cities show (Figure 19.11).
Extending Data Concepts
Using Graphs to Work with Data
Older children apply more sophisticated means to 
represent and analyze data. They use pie charts, 
stem-and-leaf plots, and box-and-whisker plots. 
They also access real data from the Internet and 
other sources and draw conclusions from these 
real-world data. The NCTM data standards for older 
children follow.
NCTM Correlation
NCTM Data Standard
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 
12 should enable all students to:
•  Formulate questions that can be addressed with data 
and collect, organize, and display relevant data to answer 
them
•  Select and use appropriate statistical methods to analyze 
data
•  Develop and evaluate inferences and predictions that are 
based on data
Expectations
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  design investigations to address a question and consider 
how data-collection methods affect the nature of the 
data set;
•  collect data using observations, surveys, and experi -
ments;
•  represent data using tables and graphs such as line plots, 
bar graphs, and line graphs;
•  recognize the differences in representing categorical and 
numerical data;
John Graunt (1620– 1674) is credited with being the ﬁ rst to 
use statistical data. Graunt studied baptismal records and 
death notices to discern population trends. Based on the data 
he found, Graunt made reasonably close predictions about 
the population of London and how long it took the London 
population to rebound after an outbreak of the plague.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
•  describe the shape and important features of a set of data 
and compare related data sets, with an emphasis on how 
the data are distributed;
•  use measures of center, focusing on the median, and un-
derstand what each does and does not indicate about 
the data set;
•  compare different representations of the same data and 
evaluate how well each representation shows important 
aspects of the data;
•  propose and justify conclusions and predictions that are 
based on data and design studies to further investigate 
the conclusions or predictions.
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  formulate questions, design studies, and collect data 
about a characteristic shared by two populations or dif-
ferent characteristics within one population;
•  select, create, and use appropriate graphical represen-
tations of data, including histograms, box plots, and 
scatterplots;
•  ﬁ nd, use, and interpret measures of center and spread, 
including mean and interquartile range;
•  discuss and understand the correspondence between data 
sets and their graphical representations, especially histo-
grams, stem and leaf plots, box plots, and scatterplots;
•  use observations about differences between two or more 
samples to make conjectures about the populations from 
which the samples were taken;
•  make conjectures about possible relationships between 
two characteristics of a sample on the basis of scatter-
plots of the data and approximate lines of ﬁ t;
•  use conjectures to formulate new questions and plan new 
studies to answer them.
Intermediate-grade children continue to learn 
how to display data in tables in meaningful ways. 
Figure 19.12 shows two tables containing informa-
tion about the populations of the world’s 12 largest 
cites; one is organized alphabetically, and the other 
numerically. By comparing the two tables, students 
should draw conclusions about which table is easier 
to read to answer different questions.
In which table is it easier to ﬁ nd the smallest city?
In which table is it easier to ﬁ nd the sixth and sev-
enth largest cities?
In which table is it easier to ﬁ nd Mexico City?
The alphabetical listing makes it easy to locate 
information by name, but the numerical listing 
makes it easier to make numerical comparisons and 
judgments.
Another reason for displaying data in a table is 
to discern a pattern in the resulting data. In Activity 
19.4 the task for students is to ﬁ nd the pattern for the 
number of building blocks in each subsequent build-
ing. In Activity 19.5 students gather data about words 
used in prose to identify the writer. Most writers will 
show a persistent use of common words, using some 
words more consistently than others. The pattern for 
word use can identify a writers’ prose. For example, 
some historians theorize that writer Christopher 
Marlowe, a contemporary of Shakespeare, may have 
written Shakespeare’s plays. A comparison of the 10 
most frequently used words by both writers shows 
that this is highly unlikely:

Another way to identify a writer’s work is to cate-
gorize words according to the number of letters in 
each word. As with common words, writers will usu-
ally use the same proportion of three-letter words, or 
four-letter words in their prose. See the companion 
website activity “Who Wrote It?” for an activity that 
uses lengths of words to identify a writer.
Figure 19.13 displays the data from the pyramid 
block activity (Figure 19.13a) and the data of world’s 
largest cities (Figure 19.13b) in computer-generated 
bar graphs.
ACTIVITY 19.4
 
Stacking Blocks (Reasoning and Proof)
Level: Grades 3 and 4
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students use a table to organize data.
Materials: Picture of block pattern in activity, centimeter or base-
10 cubes, paper and pencils, centimeter measuring tape or meter-
stick for each team, overhead projector and transparency
•  Present this situation: “Each team is to determine the 
number of blocks required to complete a pyramid that will 
be six layers high. You will have a top layer that is a single 
block resting in the center of a four-block layer beneath 
it. Each of these four blocks will rest on four blocks. 
This pattern will be used until you have completed your 
pyramid. Here is a picture of the top three layers. You will 
use blocks to build the ﬁ rst four layers and then will stop 
to decide if you can determine the total number of blocks 
without making the ﬁ fth and sixth layers.”
•  Have students use the think-build-square cooperative 
group format. This format is good when manipulatives are 
used. Each team member has enough small cubes to con-
struct the ﬁ rst four layers. First, each team member thinks 
about the picture and then builds a four-layer pyramid. 
Early ﬁ nishers may coach others in their group. When the 
pyramids are ﬁ nished, team members form a square to 
discuss how to solve the problem. Recommend that they 
use a table to organize their thinking. If a team decides it 
cannot solve the problem through discussion, they may 
add the ﬁ fth and sixth layers to one of the already made 
pyramids.
•  Allow time for students to solve the problem; then have 
them discuss their solutions. Groups that made tables 
share them with the class. Put their tables on an overhead 
transparency.
Here are tables made by two groups:
•  Have groups study the tables for a pattern. They should 
see that the number of blocks increases in a 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . 
pattern, starting at 0. They should also notice that the 
numbers identifying blocks in each layer are successive 
square numbers, beginning with 1. The number for each 
layer is the square of the number that indicates its position 
in the pyramid, top down.
•  Extend the problem: “How many layers would there be 
if the blocks were boxes in a store display, the box at 
the top was at eye level for the shortest member in your 
group, and each box was 10 centimeters high? How many 
boxes would be in the display?” Have the teams solve the 
same problem for the tallest member in the group. Dis-
cuss the information that is needed to solve the extended 
problem. Allow time for students to work on the new 
problem.
•  Discuss the groups’ procedures and responses. Focus on 
the use of tables, patterns, or both as means of solving 
the problem.

Histograms
Another means of representing data is a histogram. 
A histogram is a type of bar graph that represents the 
frequency of data that has been grouped into several 
intervals. Histograms are used to display numerical 
data rather than categorical data, as with bar graphs. 
The histogram shown in Figure 19.14 presents data 
about students in an intermediate school. Note that 
in the histogram the bars are adjacent (touching). 
The age categories are touching because they are 
continuous. Students move from one category (7– 8) 
to the next (9– 10). Thus a histogram is a specialized 
type of bar graph used to represent numerical cate-
gories that are part of a continuous group of data. In 
any histogram the intervals represented by the bars 
must be the same size; in this case each interval 
spans two years. All the data are represented in the 
histogram because the bars cover the entire range 
of data, from ages 7 to 12. Activity 19.6 asks students 
to collect data from a survey and then display the 
resulting data in a histogram on a poster.
ACTIVITY 19.5
 
Finding the Writer (Connections)
Level: Grades 5– 7
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students use a data table to organize and interpret data.
Materials: Several newspaper columns with no byline shown.
•  Hold up some of the newspaper editorial columns and 
challenge students to identify which ones were written by 
the same author. Ask for possible ways to identify a com-
mon writer for any two columns.
•  Suggest that writers tend to use the same words in what 
they write.
•  Distribute columns to groups, and assign the tasks of 
compiling data tables showing the 10 most commonly 
used words in each editorial column.
•  Students use their data to identify the columns written by 
the same person and present their ﬁ ndings to the class.

(a) This bar graph shows the number of boxes in a pyramid. 
We found that the number of boxes in each layer is the 
square of the number of boxes along one side of the layer. 
We added the ﬁ rst six square numbers to determine the num-
ber of boxes in the entire pyramid.
Line Graphs
Different types of graphs have been developed to 
display different sorts of information. Bar graphs 

are good for comparing information, such as shoes, 
pets, and populations. Bar graphs have limited value 
for the toy and pyramid data. A line graph is bet-
ter for continuous data because it shows patterns, 
trends, and relationships more clearly. Line graphs 
were originally designed to represent continuous 
data such as height, weight, and time. Line graphs 
are now used mostly for showing trends over time. 
This ability to discern trends over time can empower 
students in mathematics. A line graph that shows 
falling CD prices or changes in global temperatures 
can empower children to predict trends and draw 
conclusions from the data.
Every line graph has a horizontal axis and a verti-
cal axis, showing the characteristic that is expected 
to change with changes in the horizontal axis. If 
time in days is shown on the horizontal axis, then 
growth of a plant in inches might be recorded on 
the vertical axis. Figure 19.15 shows two points in 
time and heights measured at each time. Height at 
one point in time is shown at point A and height at 
a later point in time is recorded at point B, showing 
the amount of growth between the two points.
In a line graph each axis resembles a number 
line. Interpreting the data points according to the 
position of the point relative to the horizontal and 
vertical axes is similar to experiences children have 
had locating and interpreting points on a number 
line. Because each axis closely resembles a num-
ber line, a teacher might expect that students will 
quickly interpret the meaning of the line graph. 
However, understanding the meaning of the plot-
ted points involves coordination of two ideas simul-
taneously and is difﬁ cult for many children. Young 
children need many experiences, such as Activity 
19.7, as they are learning to internalize the relation-
ship in the graphs. These types of graphs are qualita-
tive, in that there are no speciﬁ c numerical values in 
the graphs and no scale for either axis. The absence 
of numerical data allows students to focus on the rela-
tionship between the two axes and between the two 
data points without performing any computations.
Opportunities for stu-
dents to make line graphs 
often occur during sci-
ence and social studies 
units. Students conduct-
ing a plant growth ex-
periment in science can 
measure and record the 
height of their plants and 
compare growth under various conditions. A study 
of the development of a state or nation might lead 
to preparation of a table and graph that show the 
growth of population over a period of years. A study 
of the history of transportation in the United States 
could include, for example, the growth of railroads 
in various regions. Figure 19.16 shows railroad data 
for the New England states in the 1850s. The Internet 
is a source of both descriptive and statistical infor-
mation on states, nations, population, productivity, 
economic growth, and many other topics. An Inter-
net site with many data sets and various graphs that 
display the data is http://nces.ed.gov/nceskids.
ACTIVITY 19.6
 
Histogram Survey (Representation)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students gather and display data in a histogram.
Materials: Markers, poster board
•  Present the group task to the class: Each group is to 
conduct a survey of their own class and of another class 
to gather data. The group will then display the data in a 
histogram on a poster. The poster will be displayed in class 
for all to see.
•  Groups can select their own data but suggest that the 
data must be continuous, such as weight, height, arm 
span, waist, shoe length, and pulse rate.
•  Encourage groups to be sure that their intervals are the 
same size and that they cover the entire range of data.

Qualitative Graphs
Level: Grades 3 and 4
Setting: Pairs
Objective: Students read and interpret qualitative graphs.
Materials: Set of qualitative graph sheets
•  Pass out sheets to students. Demonstrate with student 
volunteers how to interpret the ﬁ rst graph, using the 
questions on the sheet.
•  Ask students to answer the same questions for the other 
four graphs.
•  Have pairs exchange papers and compare answers. If pairs 
disagree, then have them discuss their answers until they 
agree.
•  For any graphs on which pairs cannot agree, post the 
graphs on the overhead for a class discussion.
•  Have each pair make up its own qualitative graph and 
display it on the overhead for the class to discuss.
Line graphs are particularly helpful for showing 
data from situations in which one value changes in 
relation to another (i.e., data involving rate pairs, or 
functions). Computer-generated graphs for the toy 
purchase and block pyramid situations show how 
trends are portrayed on line graphs. The line graph 
for toys in Figure 19.17a is a straight line, whereas 
the one in Figure 19.17b is a curved line whose slope 
increases with the addition of each new layer in the 
pyramid. We say that the relationship between num-
bers in the toy data is linear, whereas in the pyramid 
data it is nonlinear. Graphing programs are widely 
available, and once students are able to construct 
their own line graphs, they should use these pro-
grams to make line graphs whenever possible. Of 
course, students can continue to make their own 
line graphs when computer programs are unavail-
able. In either case, students build a foundation for 
graphing on a coordinate system in algebra.

Look ahead to Activity 19.12. Note the double line 
graph, in which two sets of data are represented on 
a single graph. How would you compare the rainfall 
of the two years depicted on this graph? •••
Circle Graphs
Circle graphs, often called pie charts, use a circle to 
portray information so that the relationship of each 
part to the whole is clearly shown. Each part of the 
circle, or portion of the pie, displays a part-whole re-
lationship. These graphs can be introduced as early 
as second or third grade. Early experiences should 
be with “clean” numbers—that is, numbers that are 
within children’s present computational knowledge. 
The numbers in the pet situation are clean because 
24 can be divided into halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, 
and twelfths by selecting the appropriate number of 
segments in the circle.
When children use data for a student-made cir-
cle graph, they ﬁ rst establish the total, or whole, to 
be considered. For the pet data (see Figure 19.2), 
24 students named a pet 
or no pet, so 24 is the to-
tal. Provide children with 
a circle marked with lines 
from the center to show 
24 equivalent parts (see 
Black-Line Master 19.4). 
Discuss the need to sys-

tematically count the number of parts of the circle 
that each type of pet will occupy and to design the 
graph correctly by putting all the same type of pets 
together. Each mark in the table (Figure 19.2) and 
symbol in the picture graph (see Activity 19.1) repre-
sent 1 of the 24 portions of the circle. Have children 
select colors to distinguish each type of pet. When 
children have ﬁ nished coloring their graphs, show 
them how a key helps readers interpret the graph. 
Black-Line Master 19.3 is a circle graph divided into 
24 equal parts. You may use it for your students’ 
display of the pet data or with other data sets that 
contain 24 individual items or some factor of 24 (12 
items, 8 items, and so forth).

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
A circle graph prepared by one group of students 
for the pet data is shown in Figure 19.18a. The stu-
dents constructed this circle graph using a template 
similar to Black-Line Master 19.3. Young students 
in grade 2 or 3 can interpret circle graphs and con-
struct their own graphs using a template and simple 
data. Figure 19.18b shows a computer-generated cir-
cle graph for the pet data that displays the percents 
of each pet. Figure 19.19 shows a computer-gener-
ated circle graph of the population of the cities in 
Figure 19.8. Note how this circle graph allows for a 
quick comparison between the populations. These 
two computer-generated circle graphs would be dif-
ﬁ cult to construct by hand. To construct such circle 
graphs, students must have mastered a number of 
mathematical concepts, including angle measure-
ment with a protractor, decimal and fraction com-
putations, and percent. It is unlikely that students 
will be able to construct 
their own circle graphs 
with messy data that re-
quire constructing differ-
ent angles until at least 
grade 6. In Activity 19.8 
children use an Internet 
site to represent survey 
data in circle graphs.

MISCONCEPTION
Some students confuse 
degree measure and 
percentage when making 
a circle graph. They will 
represent 25% of the data 
with a 25 angle instead of 
a 90 angle.
Florence Nightingale (1820– 1910) is world renowned as 
the founder of modern nursing. Few people know that she 
designed the ﬁ rst circle graphs to make her case for the need 
for sanitary hospital facilities during the Crimean War.

of the data as a stem and the remaining digits as 
leaves on the graph. These plots are especially use-
ful for comparing raw data. As an example, we use 
data provided by a class of ﬁ fth-grade students. The 
height (in inches) of each student was listed in a ta-
ble, in ascending order from the top (Figure 19.20a). 
A stem-and-leaf plot of the children’s heights was 
then developed from these data (Figure 19.20b). 
The stem-and-leaf plot is based on numbers in the 
table. The heights of the children ranged from 45 
to 64 inches, with two students in the 40s, four in 
the 60s, and the rest in the 50s. The stem is made 
by listing each tens number—4 for 40s, 5 for 50s, 
and 6 for 60s—to the left of the plot under the head-
ing “Stem.” Each numeral representing a ones place 
number is written in ascending order to the right of 
its stem number. In Figure 19.20b the 5 and 9 to the 
right of the 4 indicate heights of 45 and 49 inches, 
and numerals to the right of the 5 and the 6 indicate 
heights of other students.
The stem-and-leaf plot can be read quickly to de-
termine that only two students are shorter than 50 
inches and three are taller than 60 inches tall and 
that more students are 56 inches tall than any other 
single height. Counting the leaves tells the number 
of students in the class. Figure 19.20c shows a hand-
drawn bar graph of the same data. A computer-
generated table and stem-and-leaf plot for the same

Circle Graph Survey (Internet Activity)
Level: Grades 5 and 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students use a pie chart to display survey information.
Materials: One computer per group
•  Assign each group the task of collecting survey data from 
their classmates. Groups might select a topic such as 
favorite ice cream ﬂ avor, number of siblings, hours per day 
watching television, favorite cafeteria food, and so forth. 
Groups’ questions should provide a list of three to six pos-
sible responses.
•  Allow groups two or three days to survey other students 
in the school.
•  Once student groups have collected and collated their 
data, they should use the pie chart generator at http://
nces.ed.gov/nceskids/Graphing/ to create a pie chart to 
represent their survey data.
•  Student groups create a poster to display their pie chart 
and the survey question.

student heights are presented in Figure 19.21. Stem-
and-leaf plots would not be useful for showing data 
from the shoe and pet activities because none of 
the numbers is larger than 10. A plot for the popula-
tions of the world’s 12 largest cities appears in Fig -
ure 19.22.
Information from two data sets can be compared 
by using a double stem-and-leaf plot. The double 
stem-and-leaf plot shown in Figure 19.23, represent-
ing home run leaders in the American and National 
Leagues, was drawn by Mark, a ﬁ fth-grade student. 
One set of data is entered to the left of the stem, and 
the other set is entered to the right of the stem. No-
tice how writing out the stem-and-leaf plot on grid 
paper ensures that the “leaves” on each stem are 
correctly spaced, much as a grid helped Autumn 
with her line plot (see Figure 19.5).
Box-and-Whisker Plots
Older children study one ﬁ nal means of representing 
data, the box-and-whisker plot. A box-and-whisker 
plot graphically represents the median, the ﬁ rst and 
third quartiles, and the extreme values of a data set. 
The data for a box-and-whisker plot are fairly easy

the respective medians to construct a box-and-whis-
ker plot is relatively simple.

86, 86, 87, 88, 88, 89, 90, 90, 92, 95, 96, 100, 101
The low and high pulse rates are 73 and 101, re-
spectively. The median for the entire data set is the 
thirteenth pulse rate, 86. The median for the entire 
data set is 85.5. The median data value in a set with 
an even number of values, such as in the case of 
the entire set of values in this problem, is found by 
computing the mean of the two terms in the middle: 
(85  86)/2  85.5. Both the upper half and the 
lower half of the data have an odd number of data 
terms. In this case the median term for both sets is 
the middle term (82 and 90, respectively). We now 
have our key data points, and the resulting box-and-
whisker plot is shown in Figure 19.25. The interquar-
tile range is 81  90.
Another use of box-and-whisker plots is for 
comparison of two different data sets. Figure 19.26 
shows the box-and-whisker plots for the pulse rates 
of two classes. Although the second class had fewer 
students, the box-and-whisker plot allows for a 
comparison of the data. The mean average of both 
classes was the same, which makes the box-and-
whisker plot even more valuable in comparing the 
pulse rates of the two classes. As a comparison of 
the two box-and-whisker plots shows, the pulse rates 
from Class B are higher, with a higher median and 
a smaller range for the middle 50% of data. Such a 
conclusion would be difﬁ cult to reach using only 
tables, means, and bar graphs.

third quarters, separated by the median line at C. 
The entire box represents the middle 50% of data. 
The interquartile range is the difference between the 
ﬁ rst and third quartiles.
The relative length of each whisker and the two 
parts of the box represent how scattered the data 
are in each of the quarters. In this example the 
fourth quarter of data has a wider range than the 
data in the ﬁ rst quarter, because the whisker for the 
fourth quarter is longer than the whisker for the ﬁ rst 
quarter. Compare the second and third quarters. 
Can you tell which quarter has the wider range? 
The box-and-whisker plot shows that the box for the 
second quarter is longer than 
the box for the third quarter, 
so the second quarter has a 
wider range.
Although 
the 
box-and-
whisker plot used here is dis-
played with no scale to evalu-
ate any of the key data points, 
the comparison between the 
range of data in the various 
quarters is clearly represented. 
A completely developed box-
and-whisker plot will have a 
scale across the bottom of 
the display so that the key 
data points can be evaluated.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
It is relatively easy to represent data on a box-
and-whisker plot. Finding the ﬁ ve key data points 
requires little computation. Students can use com-
puter software or graphing calculators to make box-
and-whisker plots or draw their own. However, just 
because students can make box-and-whisker plots 
is not the reason to introduce them. It is important to 
consider box-and-whisker plots with students who 
have the mathematical maturity to understand what 
they represent: the variability of data around the 
middle.
A box-and-whisker plot might be considered an 
intermediate step between ﬁ nding the mean and 
standard deviation. The mean can be misleading if 
the data contain a few outliers (see p. 514). A box-
and-whisker plot displays data in such a way that the 
range of each quarter of data can be easily observed. 
Long whiskers and a long box indicate that the data 
have a wide range and are spread out. Short whis-
kers and a short box indicate that the data are close 
together in a short range. Students’ understanding 
of this aspect of data is necessary before introduc-
ing box-and-whisker plots. Otherwise students will 
be performing rote procedures with little under-
standing of or appreciation for their results. See the 
companion website activity “Box-and-Whisker Plot 
Pulses,” which challenges students to use box-and-
whisker plots to compare two sets of data.

Extending Children’s 
Understanding of Statistics
For younger children the use of statistics is often lim-
ited to the mode of a data set. They will also notice 
the extremes in a data set, such as the tallest person 
and the shortest person. Older children learn to con-
sider other statistical terms and concepts with the 
data they have gathered. In a set of data that records 
the height of students in a classroom, older students 
might observe several characteristics, such as outli-
ers and the mean and median height. High refers to 
the highest number, or the tallest child, and low re-
fers to the lowest number, or the shortest child. Sub-
tracting the low from the high gives the statistical 
measure called the range. Outlier refers to a piece 
of data that is widely distanced from other data on 
either the high or the low end of a distribution. A 
student who is markedly shorter or taller than others 
in a class would be a statistical outlier. Discussion of 
the highs, the lows, and the range of data is natural 
in dealing with bar graphs and stem-and-leaf plots:
•  What is the height of the shortest student? the 
tallest student? Is the height of any student an 
outlier?
•  What is the largest number of brothers and sisters 
of anyone in the class? the smallest number?

scores?

the smallest population?
•  Is any population an outlier? What is the differ-

Data are analyzed in 
different ways depending 
on the questions being 
considered. 
The 
table, 
graph, stem-and-leaf plots, 
and box-and-whisker plots 
make it easy to answer the 
most commonly asked 
questions. 
The 
height 
measurement activity and 
its table, bar graph, and 
stem-and-leaf plot (see 
Figure 19.20) provide a 
source of data for working 
with statistical concepts. 
The question “How tall 
are the children in this class?” can be answered by 
all three representations. The table shows the data 
only in numerical form, whereas the bar graph and 
the stem-and-leaf plot show it in numerical and vi-
sual forms. All these forms of presentation can be 
used to analyze the data. The table and both graphs 
show the lows and highs and the range of heights in 
numerical terms.
The statistical concept 
median, or middle num-
ber in a data set, analyzes 
the data in a different way. 
To introduce the concept, 
have students form a row 
by height from shortest to 
tallest. Beginning at each 
end, children count simul-
taneously toward the cen-
ter. When only one child 
is left, that child is at the 
middle and has the median height (assuming an 
odd number of children to count off). Half the chil-
dren are taller than that child and half are shorter. 
(Some children on one or both sides of the middle 
child may have the same height.) In a class with an 
odd number of children, the middle child’s height is 
the median. In a class with an even number of chil-
dren, there are two middle children. The median 
MISCONCEPTION
Many students think that 
the median of a set must 
be a data entry for the 
set. As with the mean, 
the median need not be 
a value that is included in 
the set. Thus in the set 12, 
14, 16, 18, the median 15 
(14  16
2
) is not a data 
item in the set.
Research for the Classroom
•
A recent research study (Meyer et al., 1999) compared 
data presented in two common formats: tables and 
graphs. The ﬁ ndings are not completely consistent with 
the widespread preference in the print media for display-
ing data in graphical form. The researchers found that 
for speciﬁ c comparisons of data facts or points, students 
performed better when the data were presented in table 
form than when the data were presented in a graphical 
form. On the other hand, graphs were clearly superior 
for ﬁ nding trends in the data. Any pattern or structure in 
data is transformed into a visual pattern by a graphical 
representation. The visual appearance of data in tables is 
unaffected by any pattern characteristic of the data. The 
investigators found that “graphic displays may indeed lead 
to the spontaneous detection of larger units of informa-
tion and of patterns in the displayed data” (Meyer et al., 
1999, p. 587). In sum, tables have a valid and important 
place in data display, especially when individual data points 
are being compared. Graphs are better suited for portray-
ing data with a pattern or trend to them. Graphs enable 
the viewer to discern the larger picture that the data show, 
especially when there are many items in the data set.
 
Research on measures of central tendency has revealed 
much about how students think about mode, median, 
and mean. Watson and Moritz (2000) found that when 
students think of the average of a set of data, such as 
the price of a home, they ﬁ rst think of “middles” (me-
dian), then “mosts” (mode) with the mean a distant third. 
Konold and Pollatsek (2002), in subsequent research, 
observed that students view the mean in four different 
aspects: as a typical value, as a fair share, as a way to 
reduce data, and as a “signal amid noise”. They suggested 
that focusing on the signal aspect of the mean can help 
students move beyond the mean as simply a fair share or 
typical value and to the more conceptually rich notion of 
the mean as a way to evaluate and compare sets of data.

512 
Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
is halfway between their heights, and the median 
height belongs to an “imaginary” child. Knowing the 
median, you can say, “Half the children are shorter 
than 55 inches, and half are taller than 55 inches; 
the low is 45 inches, the high is 64 inches, and the 
range is 19 inches.” Both the bar graph and the stem-
and-leaf plot can be used to determine the median. 
In the bar graph children can ﬁ nd the middle height 
for their class by simultaneously counting from the 
low bar and the high bar toward the center of the 
graph until the middle or middle pair of heights is 
reached. A similar procedure can be used to ﬁ nd 
the median of a stem-and-leaf plot.
Looking again at Figure 19.20, we see that by 
counting up and down from both ends of the data 
simultaneously, the middle value of 55 can be eas-
ily determined. Another method to ﬁ nd the median 
could be to count the total number of heights, in this 
case 27. The median is the 14th height and can be 
determined by counting off 14 heights from either 
the high end or the low end of the data displayed on 
the stem-and-leaf graph. Students should have many 
experiences in ordering data and then determining 
the median.
The mean, or arithmetic mean, is another way 
to answer questions about the children’s heights. 
The mean, or mean average, is the most common 
measure of central tendency. It is computed by sum-
ming all the data in a set and then dividing that sum 
by the number of data items. If children add all the 
heights and divide by the number of students, they 
ﬁ nd the mean. Rather than telling students how to 
determine a mean (or mean average), use activities 
such as those in Activities 19.9 and 19.10 to help 
them discover its meaning and how to determine 
it. See the companion website activity “An Average 
ACTIVITY 19.9
 
Finding Mean Averages
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students describe the meaning of mean average and 
compute mean averages from small collections of data.
Materials: Fifteen large wooden or plastic blocks; calculators, one 
for each group; lists of data, such as the heights of students in the 
class, number of pets owned by each class member, population of 
the 12 largest cities in North America, the number of brothers and 
sisters of each class member, area of each state west of the Rocky 
Mountains or in New England—a different list for each group
•  In a place visible to all students, arrange ﬁ ve stacks of 
blocks, as illustrated here. Discuss with students the num-
ber of blocks in each stack.
•  Demonstrate the meaning of mean average by having a 
student remove enough blocks from the tallest stack to 
put atop the shortest stack so that both stacks match the 
middle stack. Have another student do the same with the 
second and fourth stacks. Each stack has three blocks; 3 is 
the mean average for the set of blocks.
•  Discuss the concept of mean average as being the idea 
that all the highs and lows are evened out until everything 
is the same.
•  Have children meet in groups of four to discuss how to 
determine the mean average for the blocks without shift-
ing blocks from one stack to another. Use the children’s 
thinking as the basis for discussion to help them learn the 
addition-division process for determining a mean average, 
or mean. The mean average for the blocks is determined 
by adding 1  2  3  4  5  15; 15  5  3. Empha-
size that a mean average is determined by ﬁ nding the sum 
of all the numbers in a set and then dividing the sum by 
the number of numbers.
•  Give each group one set of data. Have them divide tasks 
to solve their problem. One student calls out the numbers 
one by one, a second enters them into a calculator, a third 
reads the calculator display to ensure accuracy of entries, 
and the fourth counts the number of entries and records 
the sum. Once the sum is determined, it is divided by the 
number of entries to ﬁ nd the mean average.
•  Use the results to discuss the strengths and weaknesses 
of using mean averages with data. One use of a measure 
such as mean average is to make inferences. The mean 
average of the children’s heights is probably a good indi-
cator of the heights of similar groups of children, so they 
can be used to infer heights of other groups. The mean 
average size of North American cities cannot be used to 
infer the sizes of cities on other continents.

ACTIVITY 19.10
 
Over and Under the Mean (Reasoning and Proof)
Level: Grades 4 and 5
Setting: Student pairs
Objective: Students compute the mean and then compare it to the 
original data.
Materials: Centimeter cubes, centimeter grid paper
•  Pass out 25 cubes to each pair of students.
•  Have students form stacks of 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, and 2 cubes, 
and record the height of each stack on the grid paper by 
shading in the appropriate number of squares.
•  Ask students to make all stacks the same height by mov-
ing the cubes from one stack to another. Once students 
have evened out the stacks, discuss how students moved 
the cubes. What plan did they use to make the stacks the 
same height?
•  Now ask students to compare the height of the evened 
out stacks (4) to the heights of the original stacks. They 
can do this by drawing an average line at the height of 
the mean, 4 cubes high, on their sketch of the original 
stacks. Ask students to ﬁ gure out how many cubes 
were originally higher than the 4-cube stack. Ask how 
many cubes were originally missing from the 4-cube 
stack.
•  Students should ﬁ nd that the two values are the same.
•  There are 6 cubes above the 4-cube line, and 6 cubes are 
missing below the 4-cube line. This is the result of evening 
off the stacks of cubes, and it is true for all means or 
mean averages. Repeat with stacks of 7, 3, 4, and 6, and 
7, 5, 6, 3, and 4.
•  As a culminating discussion, record the results of students’ 
ﬁ ndings on the board.
3  6  5  7 1  2  24 → 4
7  3  4  6  20 → 5
7  5  6  3  4  25 → 5
•  Ask students to reﬂ ect on how they might determine the 
mean for several stacks of cubes without shifting cubes 
to even out the stacks. The recorded data will suggest to 
students that one way to divide up the cubes evenly is to 
divide the total number of cubes by the number of stacks.
Activity,” which helps students understand how the 
mean average progressively changes as more data 
in a set become available.
The differences between the three measures of 
central tendency—the mean, median, and mode—
might be illustrated with the following problem:
•  The ages of the workers at Hamburger Haven are 
18, 20, 18, 19, 19, 18, 20, 21, 22, 45, and 54. Com-
pute the mean, median, and mode for the work-
ers’ ages.
The mean is 25, the median is 20, and the mode is 
18. Each of these values is a middle value, but they 
convey different information about the data set. The 
mode reveals the most common data value but does 
not indicate other values in the set, their frequency, 
or the range of values. The median is the value in 
the middle of the data set when the values are ar-
ranged in order of magnitude. The number of data 
values that are larger than the median is equal to the 
number of values that are smaller than the median. 
The mean is affected by extreme values in the data 
set because the mean is computed using all the data 
values. In this data set the two high values pull the 
value of the mean up so that it is higher than most 
of the values in the data set.
Suppose that the 54-year-old worker leaves 
Hamburger Haven and is replaced by a 21-year-old 
worker. How do the measures of central tendency 
change? In this case neither the mode nor the me-
dian change values. The mean is affected by the 
change in workers. It is now 22. This demonstrates 
the sensitivity of the mean to extreme values in a 
data set.
Mean, median, and mode are all ways of describ-
ing what is typical of a data set. They are all consid-

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
ered measures of central 
tendency and are used to 
represent typical pieces 
of data from a whole set 
of data. Although each 
measure displays a cen-
tral value for a data set, 
each one focuses on the 
center or average of a set 
of data in a different way. 
The measures might re-
sult in decidedly different 
central values for the same data set, and yet each 
one is sometimes referred to as an average. Each of 
these averages has strengths and weaknesses that 
are important for older students to begin to under-
stand. Many middle school students can conﬁ dently 
determine the mean, median, and mode, but they 
are unable to discern when to use each of these 
measures of central tendency and what the implica-
tions of each one are. It is important to help students 
use these measures of central tendency as tools to 
solve problems, to view these central data as end 
solutions.
As mentioned earlier, the mode is used with 
categorical data, or with numerical data when 
the most frequent number is needed. The mode is 
useful to the manager of a convenience store who 
must decide what size bottles of soda to order. 
The median and mean both refer to numerical 
data. The mean is more sensitive to extreme outli-
ers, whereas the median tends to be more immune 
to one or two extreme data values. Thus housing 
prices tend to list the median prices of homes and 
not the mean. Activity 19.11 presents one data set for 
students to analyze using these three measures of 
central tendency.
What, if any, inferences can be drawn from mean 
averages for the other sets of data used in this chap-
ter? As previously suggested, a weakness of mean 
average is that one large or small outlier in a sam-
ple can distort the mean average for that sample. 
The mean average of the world’s 12 largest cities is 
inﬂ uenced very much by the population of Tokyo. 
With it, the mean average is 20,467,000; without it, 
the mean average is 19,270,000. This shows that one 
very large city increases the mean average by more 
than 1 million compared to the mean average with-
out it. In the height situation it is possible that one 
or two children at one or the other end of the range 
can distort the mean average if they are unusually 
short or tall for their age group and the group is not 
large.
Investigations involving amounts of data so large 
that operations on them are time-consuming and 
cumbersome to perform with paper and pencil 
are easily done with com-
puter programs. A typical 
program contains spread-
sheet functions for sorting 
high to low, computing av-
erages, and treating data 
in other ways. Activity 
19.12 describes an interdis-
ciplinary activity that uses 
a spreadsheet and graph-
ing program for an investi-
gation about rainfall.
MISCONCEPTION
Some students continue 
to focus on the mode and 
ignore the mean, median, 
or other descriptives. Stu-
dents need to understand 
the value and limitations 
of the mode and other de-
scriptive statistical values 
and make appropriate use 
of all of them.
ACTIVITY 19.11
 
Comparing Averages (Communication)
Level: Grades 5 and 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students compute and then compare all three averages 
(mean, median, mode) for a set of data.
Materials: Calculators
•  Present students with the following ages of workers at 
Henrietta’s Hamburger Heaven: 17, 17, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 
45, 58.
•  Have students compute the mean, median, and mode for 
the ages of the workers.
•  Present students with the following task: “Write three 
different radio advertisements, each using one of the 
‘averages’ (mean, median, mode). Your advertisement will 
offer jobs by featuring the ‘average’ age of workers.”
•  Have groups read their advertisements to the class and 
explain who they hope to attract to work at Henrietta’s 
Hamburger Heaven.
•  In a concluding discussion, ask students which advertise-
ment appealed to them, and have them write out their 
reasons.
MISCONCEPTION
Some students think that 
in a large set of data the 
mean and the median will 
be close in value. This 
can be true if the data 
are not clustered at either 
extreme. When the data 
are clustered, the mean 
will be pulled toward the 
extreme data cluster.

ACTIVITY 19.12
 
Using and Interpreting Data (Representation)
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students apply knowledge of statistics, tables, and 
graphs to investigate rainfall patterns.
Materials: Local rainfall statistics for a recent 10-year period, com-
puter graphing program
•  Have students obtain month-by-month data on a commu-
nity’s rainfall for the last 10 years and enter the data into a 
software spreadsheet. Information can be obtained from 
the U.S. Weather Service, television weather reporters, or 
newspapers.
•  This is a good activity to conduct with classes in other 
states by e-mail. Students in participating cities can share 
rainfall information. (see chart on p. 516)
•  After students have entered the raw data into the data-
base, have them generate questions about them. Which 
year had the most rain in the last 10 years? the least rain? 
Which month had the most rain in the last 10 years? the 
least rain?
•  Which months have the highest average rainfall? the low-
est average?
•  Make a copy of each spreadsheet in a new computer ﬁ le 
so that students can experiment with the data without 
changing the original. Use the spreadsheet program to 
calculate monthly and yearly totals and averages. Use the 
Sort or Arrange function to compare the most and least 
rain for each month and year.
•  Create graphs of the rainfall data, using the software 
graphing program. A bar graph is good for showing total 
rainfall by year. A line graph is useful for showing month-
by-month rainfall averages or to compare monthly rainfall 
for different years. A circle graph can be used to compare 
rainfall by seasons.

Take-Home Activity
The following letter may be completed as a family 
activity and returned to school. Possible in-school 
activities include ﬁ nding total costs and the range, 
median, and mode of prices; comparing present 
prices with 1970 prices and ﬁ guring the percent 
difference; and preparing graphs to compare 
prices. Students can select data about which to 
write “surprising facts” in their journals. Older 
students can compare typical salaries in 1970 with 
those of today and determine whether costs of 
school supplies today are comparable to 1970 
costs.
Dear Family,
Your child is working on a back-to-school project to begin the school year.
One objective of the project is to demonstrate the use of mathematics in the 
world around us. A common experience for students who return to school at 
the end of the summer is to purchase new school supplies. We will be talking 
in class about the costs of school supplies and comparing present-day costs 
with what these materials cost in the early 1970s, perhaps a time when your 
parents were purchasing back-to-school supplies for you.
Please assist your child as needed to ﬁ nd the present-day prices for these 
items. You might try news ads, catalogs, or a nearby store. Your child will re-
cord the price of each item on the list below and then ﬁ nd the total for all the 
items in each list, using mental math, pencil and paper, or a calculator.
Be sure to compare today’s prices with the 1970s prices for each item with 
your child.
Please have your child return this activity sheet to class at the beginning of 
next week. We will use the sheet in class to explore several aspects of the 
data you collect. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to 
contact me at school.
Thank you,
Your Child’s Teacher

Summary
Because much information is provided to the public by 
the mass media in tabular and graphic form, the ability 
to organize data and use tables and graphs effectively is a 
valuable problem-solving and reasoning skill. Children’s 
early classiﬁ cation, sorting, and organizing activities de-
velop a foundation for understanding tables and graphs.
Children create their own tables and graphs to build 
both understanding and skill in interpreting them. Chil-
dren can provide much of the data they use for organiz-
ing and reporting in tables and graphs. Shoe preferences, 
pets, heights, and favorite pizzas, ice cream, and televi-
sion shows are examples of information children can 
collect.
Data from surveys, almanacs and other secondary 
sources can be used by students. Primary-grade students 
construct and read tallies, line plots, and object, picture, 
and bar graphs. Older children use picture, bar, line, 
circle graphs, stem-and-leaf plots, and box-and-whisker 
plots. Calculators and computer graphing programs help 
students organize data and prepare graphs.
The development of statistical concepts should also 
be based on children’s data. When children describe 
information, they learn statistical concepts and their 
names: most frequent, or mode; lowest to highest and 
range; middle, or median number; mean, or average; and 
outlier. Descriptive statistics help students summarize 
and communicate the main points about information 
they have collected.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Children should serve as the source of most of the 
data used in making tables and graphs. Think of 10 
topics (in addition to the ones listed in this chapter) 
about which children could collect information. 
These could involve other children in the classroom 
or school, teachers, the school building, the parking 
lot and street, transportation to and from school, 
and things and people at home.
 2.  Tables are shown in Figures 19.1, 19.2, 19.6, and 
19.8, and also in Activity 19.4. Graphs appropriate 
for each table are shown in the chapter. Select a dif-
ferent topic, and create a set of data about it. Write 
an activity plan for constructing a table and several 
graphs for that topic. Make a list of ﬁ ve questions 
children could ask and answer based on the table 
and graphs.
 3.  Collect data on the number of pairs of shoes owned 
by students in your class. Have them list the shoes in 
categories: dress, casual, athletic, and so on. Create 
a table and three graphs from the information. Com-
pare your data, table, and graph with those of other 
students.
 4.  Examine a copy of USA Today with a classmate. 
What types of graphs are shown in the paper? Are 
they effective in displaying data? Are any of the 
graphs misleading?
 5.  Write three to ﬁ ve questions for students based on 
the graphs you found in USA Today.
 6.  Give two real-life situations for each of the measures 
of central tendency: the mean, the median, and the 
mode.
 7.  Old Faithful is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park 
with a reputation for erupting faithfully about every 
hour. Actually the time between eruptions can vary 
from 50 to 100 minutes. If you had eruption data 
for two weeks, which measure of central tendency 
would you use to report the average time between 
eruptions?
   Praxis (http://www.ets.org/praxis/) The hand spans of 
ninth-grade students at Tyler High are approximately 
normally distributed, with a mean of 7 inches and a 
standard deviation of 1 inch. Of the following groups 
of measurements of hand span, which is expected 
to contain the largest number of ninth graders?
  a. Less than 6 inches
  b. Greater than 7 inches
  c. Between 6 and 8 inches
  d. Between 5 and 7 inches

   TIMSS (http://nces.ed.gov/timss/) The graph shows the 
number of pens, pencils, rulers, and erasers sold by 
a store in one week.
The names of the items are missing from the graph. 
Pens were the item most often sold, and fewer eras-
ers than any other items were sold. More pencils 
than rulers were sold. How many pencils were sold?
Using Children’s Literature
Jocelyn, Marthe. (2000). Hannah’s collection. New York: 
Penguin Books for Young Readers. (Grades K– 3)
Hannah is a collector with lots of different collections. 
She sorts her collections in different ways. One day she 
sorts her button collection by size, another day by color, 
another day by shape. So it goes with all her collections. 
Hannah has a problem, though. She can bring only one 
collection to school. What to bring? Hannah uses such 
mathematical concepts as number sense, patterns, ge-
ometry, and computation to make her surprise decision.
 
Tasks related to the reading could include:
•  How many different collections does Hannah have?
•  Which one is your favorite collection?
•  How many different things does Hannah have in all 
her collections?
•  What two different collections can you make using 
anything from Hannah’s collections?
•  Tell about a collection you have at home or one you 
would like to start.
Morgan, Rowland. (1997). In the next three seconds. 
New York: Penguin Books for Young Readers. 
(Grades 4– 6)
In the Next Three Seconds is a book that contains many 
data items about what will happen in the next three sec-
onds, minutes, hours, days, and so forth. For example, 
“In the next three seconds, Britons will eat 3,600 pota-
toes.” Students could take one of the statistic items and 
extrapolate the data for a longer or shorter time period. 
They could also take the given data and apply it pro-
portionally to another setting (e.g., How many potatoes 
will Americans eat in the next three seconds?). Students 
could then display the resulting data in a poster or pres-
ent it to the class in an oral report.

Technology Resources
Computer Software
We used three computer software programs in this 
chapter. All three are available on the Internet:
http://nces.ed.gov/nceskids/Graphing/
http://math.about.com
http://nlvm.usu.edu/en/nav/vlibay.html
Students can use these free programs to organize data 
in spreadsheets and to report it using one or more of 
many different graph formats. There are many other 
programs on the Internet and a number of commercial 
software programs, such as Tabletop by Sunburst and 
SmartDraw.com, that allow older students to work with 
large data sets and produce sophisticated graphs.

These websites contain interesting data to analyze and 
represent:

Internet Game
The game Data Picking, available at http://www.bbc
.co.uk/education/mathsﬁ le/, involves several skills relative 
to understanding data collection and representation. In 
the game students “survey” people by clicking on their 
image and recording their responses on an electronic 
tally sheet. They record the information as they collect 
it and compile it at the end of the surveying. The next 
task is to select the graph that best represents the spe-
ciﬁ c data they have collected. The sounds that accom-
pany the game are amusing to most students but can 
distract some students who might better play the game 
with the mute button activated.

Investigating 
Probability
n understanding of probability is essential for everyday 
living in our society. There is a 40% chance of rain. Should 
you cancel those picnic plans? Trafﬁ c to the beach re-
sort has been terrible the past few weekends. What is the 
likelihood of heavy trafﬁ c this coming weekend? The medi-
cation your physician recommends causes side effects in about 
10% of patients. Should you expect to suffer from side effects? The lottery 
jackpot is up to $15 million, does that improve your chances of winning? 
You were involved in a trafﬁ c accident with some minor damage. Will 
your automobile insurance premiums increase? An understanding of the 
principles of probability can help you to analyze these and similar situa-
tions and make decisions based on the mathematics of probability.
 
Probability is essentially a ratio that describes the likelihood that an 
event will or will not occur, although the study of probability involves propor-
tional reasoning. Even young children explore probability situations. Thus 
the study of probability begins in the primary grades and continues through 
high school. Probability is a challenging topic for some children because at 
times it seems to be counterintuitive. That is, the probability involved in a 
particular situation can challenge children’s beliefs and feelings. A favorite 
number, athlete, or even color will inﬂ uence how a child views a speciﬁ c 
situation. Past experiences also shade a child’s outlook, and these factors 
can muddy and even contradict probability principles in the child’s mind. A 
young child who needs to spin a 2 to win a board game may be convinced 
that she will spin a 2 because “2 is my favorite number.” An older child is 
conﬁ dent that his favorite baseball player will get a hit late in a game be-
cause he has been hitless up to now and is “due to get a hit.” With appropri-
ate experiences early in their schooling, children can put aside such errone-

CHAPTER 20

524 
Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
Two Types of Probability
In elementary school two different types of proba-
bility are introduced: mathematical probability and 
historical probability. Mathematical probability
is based on the mathematics of chance, or the 
arithmetic probability of an event occurring. For 
example:
•  What is the chance a six will come up when this 
die stops rolling?
•  What is the chance of drawing a yellow marble 
from the bag of colored marbles?
The answers to these and other questions can be 
computed using the mathematics principles of prob-
ability theory. Understanding probability enables 
older children to interpret information in news-
papers and magazines and on the Internet. Many 
problem-solving activities involving data require 
children to construct tables and graphs, search for 
patterns, perform computations, make estimations, 
draw conclusions, and 
communicate results dur-
ing a study of mathemati-
cal probability.
Historical probabil-
ity is based on informa-
tion accumulated over 
time about such things as 
weather and climate, driving experiences of teenag-
ers and elders, or voting trends in electoral districts. 
For example:
•  Is it likely to rain on our picnic if we plan it for the 
end of March?
•  Who is more likely to be involved in an accident, 
a teenage driver or a person over 70?
•  What type of candidate is most likely to be 
elected in that voting district?
Historical probability furnishes information for these 
questions and guides decision making about each 
topic. Health insurance premiums offer an example 
of how past information is used to affect the pres-
ent. Health insurance premiums depend on many 
different factors, such as age, gender, occupation, 
family medical history, personal health, habits (such 
as smoking), residence, and marital status. Insur-
ance companies have collected data on thousands 
of people on factors such as these. These empirical 
data are used to predict the likelihood that a person 
with a speciﬁ c combination of factors will make a 
claim. Although an insurance company cannot pre-
dict whether a speciﬁ c individual will make a claim, 
by analyzing the characteristics of thousands of pre-
viously insured persons, the company can predict 
the likelihood that the person will make a claim 
and can adjust the person’s insurance premiums 
accordingly.

What Teachers Should Know 
About Teaching Probability
Probability, more than any other mathematics study, 
is the focus of superstitions, hunches, and errone-
ous beliefs. Students at every level can retain tightly 
held misconceptions about probability. To leave 
such misconceptions behind, students require many 
activities in which they generate and analyze data 
from probability situations. With enough experi-
ences with probability situations, students will build 
a solid foundation for basic concepts of probability 
theory.
A well-developed unit on weather can introduce 
elementary-level students to historical probability 
and how it connects mathematics to everyday liv-
ing. People who work outdoors (e.g., farmers) de-
pend on weather records for planning their work. 
Others use daily weather reports and predictions to 
make daily decisions (e.g., road crews, construction 
workers, professional baseball players). Ask, “His-
torically, why is baseball played during summer and 
basketball during winter?” or “What time of year are 
outdoor concerts held in New England?” or “What 
time of year is a good time to plant a garden?”
Knowledge about both types of probability em-
powers students to make wise decisions in a wide va-
riety of situations. For instance, many everyday deci-
sions are inﬂ uenced by a knowledge of past events. 
If you plan a picnic in July, what are the chances that 
the weather will be rainy? In West Texas or Califor-
nia’s Sacramento Valley, rainfall records suggest that 
rain is unlikely. If you are in Hawaii or Florida, rain-
fall records indicate that rain is a likely occurrence. 
The negligible chance of winning a lottery may help 
dissuade a person from purchasing a ticket. When 
people buy an appliance, such as a television set or 
a refrigerator, they may study the reliability ratings 
of different models. Based on laboratory testing and 
the personal experiences of owners, appliances are 
rated for reliability. In other words, problems are less 
likely for some appliances than for others, based on 
past performance.
In dealing with probability, however, nothing 
is guaranteed. Rain has happened in July in West 
Texas and in the Sacramento Valley, and it can be 
dry in Hawaii or Florida; an appliance reported to 
be reliable can experience mechanical problems. 
Both weather and appliance reliability offer op-
portunities to learn about historical probability in 
the classroom. Students can obtain historical data 
about local weather from the U.S. Weather Service 
(see http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov) or from a local meteo-
rologist and estimate the chances of snow, rain, or 
sun during different seasons. Television weather re-
porters can be a source of weather data in your part 
of the country. Consumer Reports and other sources 
provide background information on the reliability of 
appliances.
The probability of any event happening ranges 
from 0 to 1. An event with a probability of 1 is certain 
to happen, such as the sun rising in the east, water 
freezing at 32F, or rolling a number from 1 to 6 with 
a single number cube. An event with a probability 
of 0 will never happen, such as the sun rising in the 
west, pigs growing wings and ﬂ ying, or rolling a 9 
with a single number cube. Events having a prob-
ability of 0 or 1 encourage students to make lists 
of events with such extreme probabilities, drawing 
on their personal experiences or creating fantasy 
events, such as the probability that Donald Duck 
will hold his temper. Activity 20.1 provides students 
with the opportunity to develop their understanding 
of such extreme probability events.
When an event has a probability between 0 and 
1, the event may or may not occur. An event that may 
or may not happen is fraught with uncertainty. Know-
ing the probability of the event happening removes 
some of the uncertainty and gives some indication 
of the likelihood of such an event. Still, there can 
be no guarantee that a speciﬁ c event will or will not 
happen if the probability is between 0 and 1. Even 
events with probabilities that are close to either 0 or 
1 are not certain. Snowfall in Wisconsin in Janu ary 
is a near certain event with a probability close to 1, 
perhaps 98
100 or 0.98, but it cannot be absolutely guar-
anteed to happen. Similarly, getting nothing but 10 
heads or 10 tails when 10 coins are tossed is an un-
likely event, as is rainfall in an Arizona desert in Au-
gust. Both of these events have probabilities close 
to 0, less than 1%. Because the probability is not 0, 
however, neither event is impossible.
The NCTM standard for probability at this level 
reﬂ ects the interest that younger children have in 
events with some uncertainty.

ACTIVITY 20.1
 
Guaranteed to Happen (or Not to Happen)
Level: Grades K– 2
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students designate and list certain and impossible 
events.
Materials: Paper and pencils
•  Tell students that they are going to decide whether the 
events in a list you will be giving to them are impossible 
(e.g., an elephant roller skating) or certain (e.g., the sun 
coming up every morning). Ask student volunteers to give 
one or two examples of each type of event.
•  Distribute the following list to student groups, and give 
them the time to decide as a group whether each event is 
impossible or certain. Ask each group to select a recorder 
who will write out the group’s decision about each event, 
and a reporter who will report the group’s decisions to 
the class.
 1. It will snow in July at Disney World.
 2. A dog will knit a hat.
 3. A ball thrown into the air comes back down.
 4. A ﬁ sh will breathe underwater.
 5. You will go a week without watching television.
 6. You pass GO in a game of Monopoly.
 7. You eat lunch at school this week.
 8. 7  6  13.
 9. Tomorrow night you will go to bed at midnight.
 10. You roll a 14 with a pair of number cubes.
•  When groups are ready, have each reporter relate the 
group’s decisions to the whole class. Discuss any event 
that a group cannot agree on or that does not seem to ﬁ t 
either category.
•  During these discussions, have students explain the 
reasons for their decisions. For example, some students 
will state that it is not impossible to go a week without 
watching television, but others will insist that it is impos-
sible to do so.
•  Ask each group to write out two events that are certain to 
happen and two events that are impossible to happen.
•  As each group shares its events with the entire class, have 
each student write down whether the event is certain 
or impossible. After each group reports its events, have 
students report their designations and discuss them as a 
class.
•  You will likely ﬁ nd that students will view many situations 
from their own experience. Some students will suggest 
that it is impossible for them to stay up past 11 p.m., 
whereas others will have done so and so will not view that 
as an impossible event. The discussion that takes place af-
ter a group reveals its ﬁ ndings is thus a critical part of the 
activity. It is in such discussions that a teacher can discern 
the thinking of the students.
NCTM Standards Correlation
The probability standards are as follows:
Develop and evaluate inferences and predictions that are 
based on data
Pre-K– 2 Expectations
In prekindergarten through grade 2 all students should:
•  discuss events related to students’ experiences as likely 
or unlikely.
Accordingly, younger 
children who are studying 
probability may simply 
designate events as likely 
or unlikely rather than try 
to quantify their likelihood 
with a speciﬁ c numerical 
probability. Such events 
should be drawn from 
their 
own 
experiences 
and from familiar settings. 
Activity 20.2 presents stu-
dents with the task of lo-
cating the probability of 
common, familiar events 
along a probability num-
ber line, labeled impos-
sible, unlikely, likely, and 
certain to happen. In Ac-
tivity 20.3 children experi-
ment with tossing a paper 
cup to gather information 
about the various prob-
abilities. The companion 
website activity “Pick a 
Vowel” has students ex-
amine their name for the 
probability of picking a 
vowel from the letters that 
make up their name. In 
the companion website 
activity “Gathering Experi-
mental Data” students ﬂ ip tacks (or toothpaste 
caps) to determine the likely probabilities of each 
outcome.

ACTIVITY 20.2
 
Maybe or Maybe Not (Reasoning and Proof)
Level: Grades 2– 4
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students designate events along a probability number 
line.
Materials: Sticky note paper, colored pencils, poster boards
•  Pass out the materials to students.
•  Draw on the board a probability number line like the one 
shown here, and discuss with the class what each word 
means. Ask student volunteers to give an example of an 
event that ﬁ ts each of the four categories.
Impossible    Unlikely    Likely    Certain
•  Ask each group to draw the probability line so that it ﬁ lls 
their poster board.
•  Distribute the following event list to each group. Ask 
students to make a sketch on the sticky note paper to 
represent each event.
Events for the Probability Number Line
1. It will snow here in De cem ber.
2. School will be closed on Thanksgiving Day.
 3. A pig will ﬂ y.
 4. When you drop a glass onto the ﬂ oor, it will break.
 5. When you shoot a basketball, you score a basket.
 6. A cat will bark.
 7.  The school bus will not stop to pick up any students.
 8. You will sit at your desk today at school.
 9. 17  8  8.
 10. The sun will shine at midnight.
•  Once the sketches are completed, have each group put its 
sticky notes on the probability line where members agree 
they should be placed.
•  Post each group’s poster, and discuss possible differences 
in the group results as a class.
•  As you discuss the group posters, note any groups that 
put their sticky notes in between the categories. For 
example, a group may place a sticky note close to, but not 
on, certain. They might reason, for example, that “School 
is always closed on Thanksgiving Day, but there might be 
an emergency that makes the school stay open, so you 
can’t be positive school will be closed.”
ACTIVITY 20.3
 
Tossing Paper Cups
Level: Grades 1– 3
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students explain the concept of likely and unlikely 
events.
Materials: A paper cup for every student, paper and pencils
•  Tell the students that they are going to investigate what 
happens when a paper cup is tossed in the air. Ask them 
to suggest what results could happen when this is done. 
They will probably answer, “Land on its side,” “Land 
right side up,” and “Land upside down.” List these pos-
sibilities, but probe for others. They might add “Get hung 
in the light ﬁ xture” or “Fall in the trash can.” List all the 
answers, and ask the children to classify them as likely or 
unlikely.
•  Have the students work in pairs. Each pair lists the sug-
gested outcomes on a paper, then tosses the paper cup 
20 times and tallies how often it actually lands in each of 
the suggested ways. Set standards for acceptable tosses; 
children should not deliberately try to hang the cup on a 
light ﬁ xture or toss it into a trash can. One child tosses 
10 times while the other records results; they exchange 
roles for the second 10 tosses.
•  Tell the children to rate each event in terms of how often 
it occurred. Young children will simply note the frequency 
as being “often,” “not often,” or “never.” Then have 
them decide whether an event is likely or unlikely to 
happen. Older children in this activity should calculate a 
common fraction with a denominator of 20 that expresses 
the probability for each suggested outcome. Using the 
fractions as a guide, they identify a number that indicates 
the likelihood of each event happening. The number is a 
decimal fraction on a scale of 0 (can’t happen) to 1 (hap-
pens every time).
•  Broaden the experience by having pairs toss different 
objects, such as toothpaste caps, half-pint milk cartons, 
thumbtacks, and plastic animals.

Extending Probability 
Understanding
Children in grade 3 and 
higher are able to reason 
more thoughtfully about 
probability 
situations. 
They are able to move 
beyond simply assigning 
events as likely or unlikely 
to using principles of 
probability to compute or 
predict the probability of 
an event. The NCTM stan-
dards for older children 
are as follows:
Develop and evaluate inferences and predictions that are 
based on data
Grades 3– 5 Expectations
In grades 3– 5 all students should:
•  propose and justify conclusions and predictions that are 
based on data and design studies to further investigate 
the conclusions or predictions.
Grades 6– 8 Expectations
In grades 6– 8 all students should:
•  use observations about differences between two or more 
samples to make conjectures about the populations from 
which the samples were taken;
•  make conjectures about possible relationships between 
two characteristics of a sample on the basis of scatter-
plots of the data and approximate lines of ﬁ t;
•  use conjectures to formulate new questions and plan new 
studies to answer them.
The standard suggests that computing numerical 
probability is appropriate for elementary school chil-
dren in grades 3 and above, using various manipula-
tives and activities to generate data. Experimenting 
with dice is a common classroom probability activ-
ity. With one die, six outcomes are possible. If a die 
is fair, or unbiased, any of the six sides is equally 
likely to show after it is rolled. Therefore the chances 
of rolling any given number are one chance in six. 
When the probability of an event is quantiﬁ ed, it can 
be expressed in three different ways: as a common 
fraction, as an equivalent decimal fraction, and as an 
equivalent percent. When probability is expressed 
as a common fraction, it takes the general form:
P  Number of times the specific event occurs
Number of times all events occur
Thus the chances of getting a 5 on a die is ex-
pressed as 1
6, because there is one chance of rolling 
a 5 out of a total of six possible outcomes. In a few 
rolls of a die one number may occur more frequently 
than the other ﬁ ve, but after many rolls the probabil-
ity is that each number will occur equally, and each 
number will be rolled 1
6 of the number of total rolls.
Probabilities from both historical and mathemat-
ical situations are expressed in the same ways. The 
probability of getting heads when a coin is tossed is 
1 out of 2 and is expressed as 1
2, 0.50, or 50%. If rain 
has occurred 980 times during the 31 days of July 
for the past 40 years, the historical probability is 980
1,240
(1,240  31  40), or 0.79, or 79%, that it will rain in 
July this year. Because probability is expressed in 
common fraction, decimal fraction, or percent form, 
it is critical that students have a working knowledge 
of these different representations before they begin 
to compute theoretical probabilities. Students with-
out knowledge of fractional representations may 
perform the proper calculations to compute a prob-
ability, but they will not be ﬂ exible in their interpre-
tation of any fractions.
Students discover the probability of getting a cer-
tain number by rolling a die and keeping a tally of the 
results. Because a small number of rolls—say, 36—
with one die may not produce experimental results 
that match the mathematical, or theoretical, prob-
ability of getting each number, 
students need to make a large 
number of rolls. If each child in 
a class rolls a die 36 times, com-
bining all the tallies shows that 
the experimental, or empirical, 
probability of the die comes 
close to, or approximates, the 
theoretical probability. Figure 
20.1 shows the results of rolling 
one die 36 times. The table in 
MULTICULTURALCONNECTION
The contexts for probability situations should reﬂ ect multi-
cultural diversity. In Chapter 2 a classroom exploration of 
the lottery lasted several days as students simulated lottery 
processes with increasing complexity. But a study of the lot-
tery might also consider lotteries in other countries. Different 
games of chance from other cultures provide a vehicle for 
probability settings that can engage students with diverse 
backgrounds. (See The Multicultural Game Book, by Louise 
Orlando, 2006.)
MISCONCEPTION
Children without prob-
ability experiences will 
often reason that every 
possibility, no matter how 
unlikely, has an equal 
chance of happening. 
They develop understand-
ing through recording the 
results of many probability 
activities.

Chapter 20 Investigating Probability

Figure 20.2 shows the results of using a computer 
program to roll one die 500 times. Notice that the re-
sults for 500 rolls more closely match the theoretical 
probabilities than do the results for only 36 rolls.
Probability investigations and computations can 
be adapted to the interests and mathematical ma-
turity of upper elementary 
grade students. In simple 
investigations with spin-
ners, dice, and coin, stu-
dents keep records and 
discuss the results of their 
experiments. When chil-
dren use a ﬁ ve-colored 
spinner (see photo), they 
ﬁ nd that the likelihood of 
getting a certain color is 
1 in 5, 1

numbered 1– 6 shown in 
the photo, an event such 
as having the spinner stop 
on 4 is 1 in 6, 1
6. Students 
will know that chances 
of winning many popular 
board games are equal for 
each player when they understand the mathemati-
cal probabilities associated with the dice or spin-
ners that control moves on the board.
Probability Investigations
Coins provide many opportunities for probability in-
vestigations. Students can put a coin in a soft plastic 
cup and shake it before dumping it onto a mat. For 
each coin event, or trial, the result is either a head or 
a tail. Children keep a tally of the number of heads 
and tails for 40 trials, as shown in Figure 20.3. For 
each ﬂ ip the chances of a head or a tail are equal. 
Over the long run the number of heads and tails will 
be about equal, or close to 50-50 (50%-50%). In the 
unlikely event that they are not, children should con-

Children tend to think that 
the results of a sampling, 
no matter how small, 
will accurately reﬂ ect an 
entire group.
Probability devices

The results of the computer program in Figure 
20.2 illustrate the Law of Large Numbers. The Law 
of Large Numbers stipulates that the greater the 
number of events or trials that occur for a particular 
situation, the closer to theoretical probability the re-
sults will be. When students collect experimental or 
empirical data from dice rolls, coin ﬂ ips, and other 
events, unless they record a large number of events, 
it is unlikely that the empirical results will match 
theoretical results.
As the data of the computer program show, for 
many trials the results closely mirror theoretical re-
sults. Students need a large number of events before 
any conclusions can be drawn about probabilities. 
Students who are just beginning to gather data for 
probabilities tend to draw conclusions from the data 
of few events. For example, a child who picks three 
blue marbles in a row from a bag of marbles may de-
clare that all the marbles in the bag are blue, when 
in fact six are blue and four are green.

sider the reasons. They should consider the ques-
tion of whether the coin is a fair one. A coin, or any 
other device, is fair when the observed chances ap-
proximate the mathematical chances. If, however, a 
head on a coin occurs many more times than tails, 
the coin might be bent or nicked or made unfair in 
some other fashion. If that is not the case, does the 
way the coin is tossed contribute to the disparity? All 
possible reasons should be considered. In the com-
panion website activity “Dice Data” students predict 
the results of rolling a single die 60 times and then 
do the rolling.
dice (see the six dice at the top center of the photo 
on p. 529). Children should record data in tables as 
they work. As a further extension, students could 
compute the theoretical probability of rolling each 
sum and compare that number with the classroom 
results (empirical probability). In Activity 20.5 stu-
dents mark a blank number cube for a board game 
they design.
Probability experiments can be varied by using 
different objects and by varying the number of tri-
als. A coin-tossing experiment using one, two, three, 
four, and ﬁ ve coins leads to an interesting pattern as 
the number of outcomes increases. When one coin 
is tossed, only two possible outcomes can happen: 
heads or tails. When two coins are tossed, the out-
comes can be two heads (HH), two tails (TT), or 
one head and one tail. However, because each coin 
can land independently, there are two ways to get 
one head and one tail, so there are four possible 
outcomes: TT, TH, HT, and HH. Thus the chance 
of tossing two coins and getting two tails (or two 
heads) is 1
4, or 25%. With three coins, eight outcomes 
are possible: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, 
and TTT. The combinations for one, two, and three 
coins are shown in a triangular arrangement in Fig-
ure 20.4. After children have worked out combina-
tions for one, two, and three coins, ask them to look 
for a pattern to see if they can predict the combina-
tions for four coins. If they cannot, list combinations 
for four coins, enter their numbers into the triangle 
in Figure 20.4, and look for a pattern again. Soon the 
students will see that each number in a lower line is 
the sum of adjacent numbers above it in the previ-
ous row. For example, the 3 in row 3 is the sum of 
the two numbers above it in row 2 (1 and 2). Extend 
the pattern to 10 coins and see what happens to the 
number of possibilities.
The arrangement of numbers in Figure 20.4 
is called Pascal’s triangle, named after the 17th-

After building such a table, the teacher asks why 6, 
7, and 8 have more occurrences than 2 and 3, or 11 
and 12. Many children will claim that there are only 
three ways to roll a 7 because, for example, they per-
ceive 6  1 and 1  6 as a single possibility. One 
reason they do so is that the commutative law for 
addition postulates that 6  1  1  6. Using two 
different colored dice can help children understand 
why 6 (red die)  1 (green die) is different from 1 
(red die)  6 (green die).
An extension of this activity can be made by 
using three or four regular dice or by investigating 
results with pairs of tetrahedral and icosahedral

Pascal’s triangle
Older students work with more complex prob-
ability experiments. The work with a pair of dice 
in Activity 20.4 introduces them to the idea that 
different probabilities exist for events occurring in 
the same activity. The table here shows the possible 
sums for rolling a pair of dice.

and wrote about it. You can create problem cards 
to guide students’ investigation of many interesting 
questions based on Pascal’s triangle. Here are some 
examples:
•  What is the sum of each row of the triangle? 
Can you describe the sequence of numbers that 
includes each sum?
•  When six coins are tossed, what is the probabil-
ity of getting three heads and three tails? What 
percent of the possible outcomes is this?
•  What is the probability of getting four heads and 
four tails when eight coins are tossed? What per-
cent of the possible outcomes is this?

ACTIVITY 20.4
 
Tossing Dice
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Whole class
Objective: Students determine the probability of an event.
Materials: Two dice for each pair of children, tally sheet for each 
pair of children, pencils, centimeter or half-inch squared paper, 
marking pens, calculator, large sheet of 1-inch squared paper
•  Students work in pairs. Give each team of children a 
pair of dice. The ﬁ rst task is to determine what sums are 
possible when two dice are rolled and the numbers are 
totaled. Have the children guess which of the sums will 
be more frequent or less frequent when rolling two dice. 
(Students with experience rolling one die often guess that 
all the numbers will have the same frequency.)
•  The children roll the dice 50 times and tally each sum as 
it occurs. One child rolls the dice 25 times while the other 
records; then they exchange roles.
•  When all pairs are ﬁ nished and have counted tallies for 
each sum, discuss their results. Ask why some numbers 
came up more frequently than others. Consider the ways 
the dice can make 2 and the ways they can make 7. Ask if 
any pairs had one number come up more often than any 
middle-range numbers, say, 3 or 10. This provides an op-
portunity to discuss how small samples, such as 50 rolls of 
the dice, do not always produce the expected outcome.
•  Each pair of children uses an Internet program, if available, 
to make a bar graph showing the results of their tosses. 
Have students make their graph on squared paper if an 
Internet program is not available.
•  As a follow-up to the activity, have two children calcu-
late the totals for each column for all the tally sheets and 
prepare a bar graph showing the class totals. Compare 
this graph with the students’ graphs. Does the classroom 
graph align with the mathematical probabilities more 
closely than the students’ graphs?

activity.

the probability of getting four heads and three 
tails? Is each of these probabilities the same per-

this?

Combinations
Pascal’s triangle is useful for determining all the pos-
sible combinations of feasible events in a probability 
situation. It is impossible to determine the probabil-
ity of any event without determining all the conceiv-
able combinations of possible events. Older students 
can ﬁ nd all possible combinations for an event by 
using a probability tree. The probability tree shown 
in Figure 20.5 was drawn by Sal, a ﬁ fth-grade stu-
dent. The tree shows all the possible combinations 
of outﬁ ts that he can wear using the following ar-
ticles of clothing: three pairs of pants (tan, gray, and 
black), three shirts (gray, tan, and white), and two 
pairs of shoes (black and tan). This probability tree 
shows 18 possible outﬁ t combinations with these 
three articles of clothing. In his probability tree Sal 
has highlighted the single combination of clothing 
that will result in an outﬁ t that is all tan. If Sal’s lit-
tle sister were to randomly select his clothing for a 
school day, there is a 1
18 probability that he would be 
dressed in all tan. Students will also discover that 
the number of combinations can be expressed as a 
multiplicative relationship:
(number of pants choices)  (number of shoe 
choices)  (number of shirt choices)  number of 
different outﬁ ts
Students who are beginning their study of combina-
tions in probability require much experience listing

or number cubes. Discuss the chances of rolling a 3 with 
a single number cube. How does the chance of rolling a 3 
compare to the chance of rolling a 6? a 1?
•  Describe to students a board game that involves moving a 
game piece along a 25-square-long path. A few squares 
can contain commands such as “Move ahead,” “Lose a 
turn,” or “Move back.” Each group will design a game 
board with a 25-square path from start to ﬁ nish.
•  The game will use a single designer number cube for mov-
ing the game piece. Each group will design a new number 
cube. Their designer cube will not show each number 
from 1 to 6 but will show some numbers more than once, 
and some numbers not at all. Each number cube must 
contain at least three numbers on the six faces, and no 
more than two numbers can have the same chance of 
coming up. Students might use different colors for each 
number.
•  Students display their ﬁ nished game boards to the class. 
They describe their number cube and show the chances of 
rolling each number represented on their number cube.
•  Have groups exchange game boards and number cubes 
and play each other’s games.

Part 2 Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving
French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal (1623– 
1662) is considered one of the cofounders of probability 
theory. Pascal began his explorations into probability as the 
result of the request of a friend, Antoine Gombard. Gombard 
had a question about how to divide up the stakes of a dice 
game when the game was cut short. Pascal’s exploration of 
his friend’s query led him to write to another mathematician, 
Pierre de Fermat, and their correspondence established the 
principles of probability.
Pierre de Fermat (1601– 1665), cofounder of probability 
theory with Pascal, was a solicitor for the French government 
by day and an amateur mathematician by night. But what a 
mathematician! He has been called Prince of the Amateurs 
because of his refusal to publish any of his mathematics dis-
coveries; yet he had a hand in the development of probability, 
calculus, number theory, coordinate geometry, and plane 
geometry.

combinations using a probability tree. Activity 20.6 
asks students to use a probability tree to determine 
the total number of different breakfast meals that 
are possible from a fast-food restaurant.
Eventually, 
middle 
school students learn how 
to compute combinations 
in various situations. They 
also study permutations, 
which are a type of combi-
nation in which the order 
of the individual items is 
important, such as the let-
ters in a word. For example, 
consider the three letters C, 
A, and T. There is only a sin-
gle combination with these 
three letters: C, A, and T (in 
any order). Six possible per-
mutations can be formed 
with these same three let-
ters. The probability tree in 
Figure 20.6 shows the six 
possibilities: CAT, CTA, ACT, 
ATC, TCA, and TAC.
Sampling
Sampling, another probability technique, involves 
choosing one or a few items from a larger group and 
drawing conclusions about the larger group based 
on the sample. Public opinion surveys, for example, 
are based on the opinions of sometimes fewer than 
1,000 people. Because the survey is taken from a 
sample of people who are carefully selected to be 
representative of the entire country, such surveys 
are reasonably accurate representations of the 
opinions of the entire population. Children can use 
colored candies, marbles, beads, or blocks for sam-
pling experiments.
Activity 20.7 describes a simple sampling process 
that can be used to estimate the colors of marbles 
in a bag or box. Activity 20.8 is a similar activity, in 
which students use a cumulative sampling strategy. 
They ﬁ nd that by combining the results of several 
independent samples, they can make a better esti-
mate about the entire group. As with experimental 
probability results, the larger the sample, the better 
the resulting data are for making predictions.
Geometric Probability
In addition to dice, coins, and shoes, students can 
gather data from area relationships between geomet-
ric ﬁ gures. Children have an intuitive understanding

Although Pascal’s triangle bears the name of Blaise Pascal, 
he was not the ﬁ rst to explore its properties. Chinese math-
ematician Chu Shih-Chieh wrote about the same triangle in 
1303, more than 300 years before Pascal made his discovery 
of it. The triangle bears Pascal’s name because he investi-
gated its properties more deeply.

ACTIVITY 20.7
 
Sampling (Communication)
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students conduct and explain a simple sampling 
investigation.
Materials: Bags of 100 plastic beads or chips of three or four 
different colors, one bag for each group of four students; record 
sheet for each group; pencils. Prepare two or three bags with the 
same number of beads or chips of each color and the rest with 
different numbers of beads or chips of each color.
•  Use the roundtable cooperative plan. The children number 
off: 1, 2, 3, 4. Child 1 has the bag, and child 2 has the 
tally sheet and pencil. Child 1 draws an object from the 
bag, notes its color, and replaces it while child 2 makes a 
tally mark for its color on the record sheet.
•  Drawing and tallying, the children rotate through the 
group after each draw until 50 draws have been made.
•  After 50 draws, have the students study the total for each 
color and guess how many of each color are in the bag. 
Remember, there are 100 objects in the bag!
•  Use the totals to create percentages: 14 blue beads in 
50 draws  14
50  28%, or 28 blue beads of 100; 12 red 
beads in 50 draws  12
50  24%, or 24 red beads in 100; 
24 yellow beads in 50 draws  24
50  48%, or 48 yellow 
beads in 100.
•  Share results of the draws. Do any of the groups believe 
that they may have the same number of beads or chips of 
each color in the bag? Do they believe that each bag has a 
different number of beads or chips of each color?
•  Have children remove and count each color of bead or 
chip. How accurate were the results of the samplings? Did 
any bags contain the same number beads or chips of each 
color? If so, were they the same ones predicted during the 
earlier discussion? Are the children satisﬁ ed that drawing 
50 objects enabled them to make accurate predictions?
To extend the activity, tell children to take a bag home to 
repeat the process by drawing more than 50 or fewer than 
50 objects and tallying the results. Discuss whether the 
accuracy decreases when fewer objects are drawn. Does it 
increase when more are drawn? Does there appear to be a 
number beyond which accuracy does not increase?

•  Relate to students that Henrietta’s Hamburger Heaven has 
decided to offer breakfast meals. The plan is to have the 
following foods:
•  Three kinds of breakfast sandwiches: egg and cheese; 
ham, egg, and cheese; and bacon, egg, and cheese
•  Four types of breads: English mufﬁ n, bagel, croissant, 
and biscuit
•  Two drinks: coffee and orange juice
•  Have groups select a reporter, a recorder, and a resident 
artist for the activity.
•  Each group is to build a probability tree to display all these 
data and to answer the questions that follow.
•  Once groups have designed a probability tree that they 
all agree is correct, have each group copy the tree onto a 
poster board.
•  Groups are to use their probability tree to answer each 
of the questions and to explain how they used the tree 
to get their answers. Once all groups have completed the 
questions, have groups take turns with the questions and 
use their probability tree to explain their answers to the 
rest of the class.
1.  You go to Henrietta’s Hamburger Heaven every 
morning and eat a different breakfast combination. 
How many mornings would it be before you had the 
exact same breakfast again?
2.  What is the chance that someone across the room 
eating breakfast has ordered the same combination 
that you ordered for breakfast?
3.  Henrietta is thinking of adding tea as a beverage. If 
she does add tea to the breakfast menu, how many 
different breakfast combinations would there be?
4.  The tea idea didn’t work out. Instead of adding tea 
as a drink selection, Henrietta drops the tea and 
adds another bread: toast. Now how many break-
fast combinations are there?
5.  The toast idea didn’t work either. Now Henrietta is 
going to add another sandwich: sausage, egg, and 
cheese. How many different breakfast combinations 
are there now?
6.  Using the answers to the last four questions, explain 
how many different ice cream cones you could 
order from Iggy’s Ice Cream Igloo. Iggy offers 12 
ﬂ avors, plain or sugar cones, and nuts, sprinkles, or 
chocolate bits as a topping. You may make a new 
probability tree, or just part of one, to help you get 
the total number of different sundaes.

of targets and bull’s-eyes. The bull’s-eye is the small-
est part of the target and carries the highest number 
of points. The largest parts of a target (the easiest to 
hit) carry the fewest points.
Spinners that children use to play board games 
are an example of geometric probability. In the spin-
ner pictured in Figure 20.7a, all the numbers have an 
equal chance of coming up because each number 
has a region that is equal in size to all the other in-
dividual regions. The spinners in Figures 20.7b and 
20.7c show that 1 will come up twice as often as 2, a 
relationship that could be predicted by visual inspec-
tion or by gathering data from a number of spins. In 
Figure 20.7b the area of region 1 is 1
4 of the area of 
the spinner template, and the area of region 2 is 1
8 of 
the template. In Figure 20.7d the area marked 1 is 1
4
the area of the template, and the area marked 2 is 1
8
of the template. In both cases the area marked 1 is 
twice as large as the area marked 2. With a sufﬁ cient 
number of spins, this 2:1 ratio would be approached 
with experimental data. Activity 20.9 extends the 
concept of geometric probability on a spinner by 
having students design their own spinner templates. 
In Activity 20.10 students use an interactive activity 
on the Internet to explore probability on a spinner.
ACTIVITY 20.8
 
Multiple Drawing Sampling
Level: Grades 5 and 6
Setting: Groups of four
Objective: Students use multiple drawings to estimate the contents 
of bags.
Materials: Bag with 100 plastic beads of four colors, two record 
sheets for each team, calculators
•  Tell the children that each bag contains 100 beads of four 
different colors. Their task is to estimate the number of 
each color. They will draw ﬁ ve beads at a time without 
looking and return the beads after each draw. Children 
work in a roundtable format. Child 1 has a bag, child 2 
has a record sheet, child 3 has a calculator, and child 4 
has a record sheet. Child 1 draws ﬁ ve objects, and child 2 
writes the number of each color on a record sheet. Child 
3 uses the calculator to determine the percent that each 
color is of the total, and child 4 writes the percent on a 
record sheet.
•  Functions rotate until each child has performed each role 
twice. After each draw, students calculate a running total 
for each color and use it to estimate the fraction for each 
color of bead.
•  After ﬁ ve beads have been drawn four times, each team 
estimates the number of beads and the percent of each 
color.
•  Repeat the process to make a total of eight drawings, and 
again estimate the number and percent of each color.
•  Count the actual objects to check the estimates. Follow 
up with a discussion similar to the one described in Activ-
ity 20.7.

Students can make their own spinner with a pa-
per clip. Students can use a pencil to secure one end 
of the paper clip spinner and spin the paper clip to 
replicate a spinner. In Chapter 14 the black-line mas-

Expected Value
Expected value is a topic that can have much ap-
peal to older children. They may be familiar with the 
television show Wheel of Fortune or carnival games 
of chance that use a spinning wheel. Once students 
have ample experiences designing spinners for prob-
ability explorations, they are able to use the princi-
ples of probability to explore the expected value of 
speciﬁ c spinners. Consider the spinner shown here.

ACTIVITY 20.9
 
Spinner Probability
Level: Grades 4– 6
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students design their own templates for spinners, pre-
dict probabilities, and test their predictions.
Materials: Spinners with blank templates, paper and colored 
pencils
•  Show students a spinner from a board game (or from 
a game you have designed) with all numbers having an 
equal chance of coming up (see Figure 20.7a).
•  Have students discuss why this is a fair spinner. Probe for 
students to recognize that equal areas on the spinner have 
an equal chance of coming up.
•  Challenge students to design two different spinner tem-
plates on which the numbers (or colors) do not have an 
equal chance of coming up. They should use three to six 
numbers or colors for the spinner template.
•  Once a group draws a new spinner template, have them 
predict how often the spinner will land on each number 
or color in 100 spins. Each group should build identical 
templates of their spinner for each person in the group. 
Then the group should make 100 spins and collect data to 
verify their predictions for the template.
•  Have groups take turns displaying their templates to the 
class. Each group can challenge classmates to predict 
about how often each number or color will come up in 
the 100 spins, based on visual inspection of the spinner.

This spinner will pay out to the player the amounts 
shown in each sector of the spinner. Expected value 
concepts enable students to determine the expected 
payout for the spinner. Naturally any prediction such 
as this assumes a large number of spins, so the Law 
of Large Numbers is a factor in making any predic-
tion. It is impossible to predict the result of a single 
spin. Rather, the probabilities shown here specify 
the tendency of the spinner for many spins.
For this spinner the chance of landing on each 
sector is
$4  1
2   $6  1
4   $8  1
8
The probability of landing in each sector can be 
combined with the posted winnings for each sec-
tor to determine the expected value or expected 
winnings for playing a game of chance with this 
spinner:
(1
2  $4)  (1
4  $6)  (1
8  $8)  (1
8  $8)
 
 $2  $1.50  $1.00  $1.00
 
 $5.50
In the long run, with many spins, the expected 
value or winnings per spin is $5.50. Thus, if a chari-
table organization were to hold a fundraiser and in-
clude a game using this spinner to raise funds for 
their charity, the price of each spin would have to 
exceed $5.50. Any lower price to play would result 
in the charity paying out more money than the game 
earns. A charge of $5.50 to play would mean that the 
game would break even in the long run and not earn 
any funds. So, if the organization charges at least 
$6.00 to play, they will likely raise some funds using 
this spinner.
Students can explore expected value using spin-
ners that they have produced from earlier activities. 
They can also design original spinners with different 
payouts for each sector and determine the break-
even price to use the spinner in a game of chance. 
Students might then test their ﬁ ndings by recording 
the results of spinning their spinner. Again, the Law 
of Large Numbers requires that students collect data 
from a large number of spins. In this case perhaps 
50 spins will produce enough data to support the 
students’ computations.
Both Activities 20.9 and 20.10 used spinners to 
develop probability concepts. In Activity 20.9 stu-
dents built their own spinners, and in Activity 20.10 
students used an Internet program to simulate us-
ing a spinner. Activity 20.11 is an assessment activity 
that probes students’ understanding of probability 
in a geometric setting. Note that the dimensions of 
the ﬁ gures in the game board are not given. We sug-
gest making a game board that resembles the game 
board that is shown but does not duplicate it. One 
of the tasks of the activity is to assign an appropri-
ate number of points according to the probability of 
landing a penny in each ﬁ gure. With no speciﬁ c di-
mensions given for any of the ﬁ gures, students must 
use empirical probability to assign points to each 
ﬁ gure. (In this case the chances of a penny landing 
anywhere on the target is totally random, in contrast 
to a game of darts or pitching pennies, in which 
players aim for one particular region of the target.) 
As in all the other probability activities, the chance

Materials: Internet access
•  Go to http://nlvm.usu.edu/en/nav/vlibrary.html and follow 
the links to Spinners in 3– 5 Data and Probability.
•  Demonstrate how to change the spinner by increasing or 
decreasing the share of each color and by increasing and 
decreasing the number of colors in the spinner.
•  Show how to “spin” the spinner and record the results.
•  Ask students to design a spinner with three colors so that 
the spinner has an equal probability of landing on each 
color.
•  Check on each group’s design, and then have students 
check their spinner design by recording the data for 
30 spins.
•  Discuss the role of the Law of Large Numbers in the data 
that result. (These data will not always show a 10-10-10 
result.) Combine the data from all groups to obtain an 
experimental result that is closer to the theoretical predic-
tion of 13 for each color.

Research for the Classroom
•
Research has conﬁ rmed the persistence of characteristics 
similar to the gambler’s fallacy in children who are learn-
ing probability principles (e.g., Watson & Moritz, 1999; 
Shaughnessy, 1992, pp. 470– 472). Individuals who believe 
the gambler’s fallacy predict that a probability event will be 
inﬂ uenced by past events—that the coin or slot machine 
has a memory. For example, if a coin has come up heads 
10 times in a row, a believer in the gambler’s fallacy will 
reason that the next ﬂ ip of the coin has to come up tails 
because “tails is due.” This reasoning is similar to that of 
individuals who play a single slot machine for a large num-
ber of tries, believing that eventually the machine has to 
pay out. Research with students drawing colored balls out 
of a bag revealed that they expected a 50-50 distribution 
of the two colors. They persisted in their belief through 
many trials of drawing the balls out of the bag (and then 
replacing them), anticipating that the next draw and sub-
sequent draws would equalize the colors they had already 
drawn, as if the marbles or the bag had a memory of the 
preceding events.
 
Related research has found that students will make 
predictions of the likelihood of an event based on how 
common the event is to them or how easily the event can 
be duplicated or simulated (Shaughnessy, 2003). For exam-
ple, when asked whether there was a greater number of 
two-person groups or eight-person groups possible out of 
a total of ten people, students responded that more two-
person groups were possible, although this is untrue by a 
large factor. The reason is that these students could easily 
compose many different two-person groups in a short 
time compared to the time needed to construct eight-
person groups. Thus they persisted in their conclusion that 
more two-person groups would be possible. Children will 
predict that they will select their favorite color marble out 
of a bag, even if there are few of those marbles compared 
to the other colors.
 
These research results and many others underscore the 
effects of personal experiences and beliefs that result in 
misconceptions. Students will bring to school experiences 
with speciﬁ c events, ranging from board games with dice 
and spinners to personal preferences regarding colors. 
These outside inﬂ uences will prejudice their thinking about 
probability. Some students may even believe that God or 
their mental powers will inﬂ uence a coin ﬂ ip or a roll of 
the dice. The classroom teacher must be aware of these 
factors and work to help students leave their misconcep-
tions behind.
ACTIVITY 20.11
 
Geometric Probability (Assessment Activity)
Level: Grades 3– 5
The game board you see here is designed for tossing 
pennies. Here are the rules for playing the game.
•  If the penny lands off the game board, it doesn’t count, 
and the player gets another turn.
•  If the penny lands on the board but misses the ﬁ gures, the 
player still scores 1 point.
Just one thing: A player has to pick up the penny with his 
or her eyes closed and then drop it on the game board. 
Thus a player cannot really aim for any part of the board. 
Use what you know about areas and probability to give 
the chance of landing on each part of the game board.
1.  What are the chances that the penny will land in the 
rectangle? in the square? in the triangle? on the game 
board but not in any ﬁ gure?
2.  Are the points on the game board OK? Do you think 
that the points should be different to make the game 
board fairer? How would you change the game board, 
and why?
3.  Suppose that you designed a new game board with a 
circle, square, and triangle. What would be true about 
the size of these three ﬁ gures if the chances of drop-
ping a penny in each of them were equal?

of an individual event occurring is totally random. 
If events were not totally random, they could not be 
predicted over the long run by theoretical probabil-
ity and the results would not be effective for predict-
ing future results unless the same nonrandom fac-
tors, such as aiming at a particular part of the target, 
were reproduced exactly.
Simulations
Simulations are used to determine the probability 
of an event when there are no data from previous 
events, it is not possible to gather experimental data 
of the event, or the theoretical probability is impos-
sible to compute. Simulations must be constructed 
carefully so that the data will properly represent 
the actual event. Activity 20.12 describes a simula-
tion activity for students. In this simulation rolling a 
single number cube represents ﬁ nding toy prizes in 
random boxes of cereal.

ACTIVITY 20.12
 
A Probability Simulation (Connections)
Level: Grades 3– 5
Setting: Small groups
Objective: Students conduct a simulation to explore the probability 
of a real-life situation.
Materials: One number cube per student
•  Describe to students how and why simulations are used 
to determine the chance of an event happening. Stress 
that simulations are sometimes necessary because it is 
impossible to gather experimental data from the event to 
determine the probabilities involved.
•  Ask students what prizes or toys they have collected from 
cereal boxes or fast food meal packs. Probe for students 
to tell how many different individual ﬁ gures or toys there 
were in a particular collection they mention.
•  Have students select a reporter and a recorder for their 
group.
•  Describe to students a promotion for a new cereal, Break-
fast Bash. The Breakfast Bash manufacturers have put one 
of six different action ﬁ gures in each cereal box: Handy 
José, Sharp Simone, Mighty Miguel, Lucky Luisa, Super 
Sam, and Crafty Crissy. Ask students to estimate in their 
groups about how many boxes of cereal they would have 
to buy to be likely to collect all six action ﬁ gures.
•  Relate that one way to ﬁ nd out would be if they all 
bought many boxes of cereal and recorded the data. Have 
students discuss why that strategy is impractical.
•  Because it is impractical to collect the experimental data, 
explain to students that using a number cube can replace 
actually buying boxes of cereal.
•  Ask students what it is about a single number cube that 
relates to the problem of deciding how many boxes of 
cereal to buy in order to collect all six action ﬁ gures. (An-
swer: There are six action ﬁ gures and six numbers on the 
faces of the number cube.)
•  As a class, assign one number from the number cube to 
each action ﬁ gure. Be sure that each group’s recorder 
writes out which ﬁ gure each number represents for 
the group to use as a reference. Because each number 
represents an action ﬁ gure, one roll of the number cube 
can represent opening a box of cereal. Whatever number 
comes up will represent the speciﬁ c action ﬁ gure in that 
box.
•  Have each student roll a number cube until each num-
ber on the cube has come up. Be sure that each student 
records the results of each roll, using tally marks in a table 
like the one shown here. When all the numbers have 
come up, students should count the number of times they 
rolled the number cube.
•  Have the group reporter tell the group’s results, and write 
the results on the board. Ask students to think of the 
number of rolls that seems to best represent the overall 
results for the class. Is it the mean, median, or mode of 
the data? Ask students how to evaluate outliers such as 
7 rolls or 32 rolls.
•  Ask students about the role of the Law of Large Num-
bers in this simulation. One classroom set of data is not 
really sufﬁ cient to make a prediction about the number 
of boxes. More data are needed.
Probability simulations with dice or similar manipulatives 
that are also used for games of chance are called the Monte 
Carlo method, after the famous Casino de Monte Carlo in 
Monaco. Simulations were ﬁ rst used by physicists working on 
the Manhattan Project during World War II. The simulations 
were used to develop shields and dampers for nuclear bombs 
and reactors, something that could not be done by direct 
experimentation.

Take-Home Activities
This take-home project involves sampling data to 
predict how many minutes of commercials run in 
an hour of television time. Students will need a 
television and VCR to complete this project. If some 
students in the class do not have access to a VCR or 
digital video recorder at home, they might work 
with a student who has a VCR or complete the 
project in school using a tape you have made.
Dear Parents,
Your daughter/son will be using a television and VCR to conduct a probability 
experiment. They will record one hour of evening television and then analyze 
the taped material. Their data ﬁ ndings will be combined with data from other 
students in the class to predict the amount of commercial content in a typical 
hour of network television. This will help them to understand how sampling is 
used in mathematics to make predictions.
Analyze the recorded material with your child. Have them explain what they 
are doing and how the data they record will be used.
If I can answer any questions, please contact me at school.
 1.  Have your child record one hour of any network television station. Be 
sure your hour runs during the evening, between 5 and 11.
 2.  Have your child start the program from the beginning, and then press 
fast forward. After a short time, your child should stop the tape and note 
whether there is a commercial or a program playing.
 3.  Have your child press fast forward again and again stop the tape. What is 
playing now, a commercial or a show?
 4.  Your child should repeat this process 30 times. Help your child keep a 
careful record of commercials and programs that are playing at each 
stop. If the program runs out, your child can move back to the beginning 
and continue the process.
 5.  With your child, use the data results to predict how many minutes out of 
the 60 minutes are commercials.
 6.  Time how long the commercials actually last in the hour you taped.
 7.  Compare your prediction to the actual length of commercial time.
 8.  Have your child bring the data to class on Wednesday. We will combine 
data to determine what is a reasonable estimate of commercial time in an 
hour of typical network evening television.
 9.  Be sure your child reports back to you the results of the class data and 
analysis.

Summary
Younger children ﬁ rst learn about probability when they 
describe real-life events as impossible or certain, likely 
or unlikely. Older children conduct probability experi-
ments to develop important problem-solving skills and 
an understanding of chance. They perform experiments, 
record and organize data, examine data for patterns, es-
tablish numerical odds, and make predictions from their 
observations.
Probabilities are derived from analysis of previous 
events and from mathematical sources. Historical prob-
ability is based on accumulated data that pertain to par-
ticular events, such as rainfall or appliance reliability. 
Mathematical probability deals with the mathematics of 
chance, such as ﬂ ipping coins and rolling dice. Children’s 
work with probability is largely exploratory; formal in-
struction may be limited to mature students in the upper 
elementary grades. However, a teacher models correct 
terminology so that children can develop a vocabulary 
about probability.
Study Questions and Activities
 1.  Have a roommate or family member make and give 
you a collection of objects in a bag or box similar 
to one of the collections in Activity 14.7. Use the 
method explained in Activity 14.7 to determine the 
characteristics of the set of objects. Compare your 
predictions with the actual objects in the bag or 
box.
 2.  Examine the local or state lottery. Find out the 
chances of winning the grand prize. How many 
tickets would you have to purchase to be assured of 
having a 50% chance of winning?
 3.  Explain why one mathematician has called lot-
teries “a tax on people who do not understand 
mathematics.”
 4.  Monitor the time it takes you to brush your teeth for 
the next few days. Use the data to predict how long 
you will need to brush your teeth the next time you 
brush.
 5.  Some reports suggest that the chance of dying from 
a bee sting in the United States is greater than the 
chance of dying from a snakebite. Does this seem 
reasonable to you? How are such probabilities 
determined?
 6.  There is a 60% chance of rain tonight. Discuss with a 
classmate whether you would still plan on going to 
an outdoor concert.
   Praxis (http://www.ets.org/praxis/) A two-sided coin is 
unfairly weighted so that when it is tossed, the prob-
ability that heads will result is twice the probability 
that tails will result. If the coin is to be tossed three 
separate times, what is the probability that tails will 
result on exactly two of the tosses?

Using Children’s Literature
Holtzman, Caren. (1997). No fair! New York: Scholastic. 
(Grades 2– 4)
Probability as it relates to fairness is the theme of this 
book. Two central characters, David and Kristy, play 
games against each other. As they play, several issues 
arise. Who gets to choose the game? Do they each have 
a fair chance of winning? The story examines probabil-
ity in the context of fair games.
Cushman, Jean. (1991). Do you wanna bet? Your chance 
to ﬁ nd out about probability. New York: Clarion. 
(Grades 4– 6)
This book is a collection of problem situations that in-
volve probability. Probability with coins, playing cards, 
the weather, and sampling are some of the ideas in the 
problem stories. A changing cast of characters is con-
fronted with a problem to solve, the answer to which is 
found by the principles of probability (e.g., Given a 60% 
chance of rain tomorrow, should the friends still plan 
a hike for the next day?). The solution for each story 
problem immediately follows the story presentation in 
the text and is explained at the same level as the story 
itself. This book could almost serve as a self-tutorial in 
basic probability principles.

alternative algorithm An algorithm that is different from the 
traditional or conventional algorithm used most frequently in 
a culture.

lists several performance objectives and gives a rubric for each 
performance indicator. Compare with holistic scoring rubric.
anecdotal record A written note about what a student did 
and said.
array In the geometric interpretation of multiplication, the 
graphic arrangement of objects in rows and columns.
associative property of addition The order in which ad-
dends are added does not change the sum. Applies to three or 
more addends. See also commutative property of addition.
associative property of multiplication When three or more 
factors are multiplied, the order in which they are paired for 
computation does not affect the product. See also commutative 
property of multiplication.
B
bar graph A graphical representation of numerical data that 
uses vertical or horizontal bars. Bar graphs are used to display 
categorical data.
base The number to which a percent is applied. Example: 50% 
of 60 (the base) is 30. See also percent and percentage.
behaviorism A theory of learning that focuses on observable 
behaviors and on ways to increase behaviors deemed positive 
and decrease behaviors deemed undesirable.
bell curve See normal distribution.
benchmark (1) Speciﬁ c grade level learning target provided 
by state and local schools. (2) In estimation, a referent that 
gives students a comparison unit or amount to use for an esti-
mate. Without a benchmark, students have a hard time making 
a reasonable estimate and reﬁ ning it.
bimodal When there are two modes for a set of data.
box-and-whisker plot A graphical representation of the me-
dian, the ﬁ rst and third quartiles, and the extreme values of a 
data set. The data for a box-and-whisker plot are fairly easy to 
obtain, consisting of the high and low data points and three 
medians.
C
cardinal number A number that tells how many objects are 
in a set. Compare with nominal number and ordinal number.
Cartesian cross-product A multiplication strategy that in-
volves the number of one-to-one combinations of objects in 
two or more sets. It shows the total number of possibilities 
made by choosing one option from each group of choices. 
Also called combinations. Compare with geometric interpreta-
tion and repeated addition.
Cartesian geometry See coordinate geometry.
classiﬁ cation Matching groups of objects sharing common 
characteristics, or attributes. Classiﬁ cation is an important 
skill in all subject areas. Also called sorting or grouping or 
categorizing.
classroom action research The process in which teachers 
conduct research in their classrooms by asking and answer-
ing questions about student learning and effective teaching. 
Teachers describe, explain, and try methods to improve their 
students’ learning. They assess student learning by collecting 
data, drawing conclusions, and changing their techniques to 
increase learning.
closed questions Questions that call for short, speciﬁc 
answers.
cognitive-developmental theories Theories such as those 
of Jean Piaget, Richard Skemp, and Jerome Bruner that pro-
pose levels of successively more complex intellectual under-
standing or conceptualization.

commutative The property in which the order of the numbers 
in a mathematical function does not matter. For example, addi-
tion is commutative; subtraction is not.
commutative law of addition See commutative property of 
addition.
commutative law of multiplication See commutative prop-
erty of multiplication.
commutative property of addition The order of addends 
does not affect the sum. Also called commutative law of addi-
tion. See also associative property of addition.
commutative property of multiplication When the order 
of factors is switched, the product is the same. Also called com-
mutative law of multiplication. See also associative property of 
multiplication.
comparison subtraction Compares the size of two sets or 
the measure of two objects. The quantity of both sets or mea-
surement of both objects is known. The comparison question 
in subtraction asks “how much larger” or “how much smaller” 
one set is than the other. “What is the difference” is another way 
of expressing comparison between the two sets. Compare with 
completion subtraction, takeaway subtraction, and whole-part-
part subtraction.
compatible numbers A mental computation strategy that 
looks for easy combinations of 10, 100, or 1,000.
compensation An alternative approach to calculation often 
used in addition and subtraction in which the original num-

bers are adjusted to make an easier calculation and then cor-
rected, or compensated, in the ﬁ nal answer.
completion subtraction Comparison between an existing 
set and a desired set, or between an incomplete set and a com-
pleted set. The question for completion is “how many more 
are needed?” or “how much more is needed?” Compare with 
comparison subtraction, takeaway subtraction, and whole-part-
part subtraction.
composite number A number that has several factors. Com-
pare with prime number.
computational ﬂ uency The ability to compute with conﬁ -
dence and ease in a variety of situations using the appropri-
ate operation and computational strategy and determining 
whether the result is reasonable and useful.
concrete operational stage Third stage of Piaget’s devel-
opmental stages. Occurs around ages 7 to 12 when children 
master the underlying structure of number, geometry, and 
measurement. Work with concrete objects is the foundation for 
developing mathematical concepts represented by pictures, 
symbols, and mental images. Compare with formal operational 
stage, preoperational stage, and sensorimotor stage.
congruent The property in which one object ﬁ ts exactly on 
the other. If all points on one line segment match exactly with 
all points on another segment, they are congruent. Any two 
plane or space ﬁ gures are congruent when all their corre-
sponding points match exactly. Compare with similar.
constructivism A learning theory that holds that learning is a 
result of building or constructing meaning from many experi-
ences; individuals construct their understanding from physi-
cal and social interactions through the formation of schema—
complex cognitive relationships.
continuous Qualitative in nature. Continuous properties can 
be subdivided into progressively smaller and smaller units that 
can take on an inﬁ nite number of values; to make quantitative 
comparisons about them, they must be measured. Compare 
with discrete.
cooperative group learning A grouping strategy that is de-
signed to increase student participation by capitalizing on the 
social aspects of learning.
coordinate geometry Using a coordinate grid formed by 
two number lines—one extending horizontally and the other 
vertically—to locate objects on the grid. Also called Cartesian 
geometry.
counting A number concept in which a sequence of words is 
related to increasing number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . .
counting-on A particularly effective learning strategy for ad-
dition. Following examples of the “plus 1” rule such as 5  1, 
8  1, and 2  1, students will generalize “adding 1 is just count-
ing to the next number.” “Plus 2” and “plus 3” are extensions.
criterion-referenced test A standardized test that provides 
diagnostic information for teachers because it shows which 
concepts and skills each student has mastered instead of com-
paring students to each other as in a norm-referenced test. Mas-
tery is determined by the number of items answered correctly 
for each performance objective and the number of objectives 
mastered. Compare with norm-referenced test.
D
decimal system A number system in which place value is 
based on powers of 10. The starting position is called the units 
or ones place. From any place in the system, the next position 
to the left is 10 times greater, and the position to the right is 
one-tenth as large. This characteristic makes it possible to rep-
resent whole numbers of any size as well as decimal fractions 
with the system. The metric system for measurement and the 
United States monetary system are decimal systems.
decomposition The traditional subtraction algorithm, com-
monly called borrowing, which involves regrouping or trading 
down from a larger place value to a smaller place value before 
subtraction.
denominator In a common fraction, the number of equal-
sized parts into which the whole, or unit, has been subdivided. 
For example, the “2” in 1
2 is the denominator. Compare with 
numerator.
density A measure of the mass to volume ratio of a substance 
or object. The higher the mass to volume ratio, the greater the 
density will be.
density property of numbers There is always another num-
ber between any two numbers.
difference The degree or amount by which one set differs 
from another set.
directed teaching/thinking lesson Structured, but interac-
tive, method of teaching mathematics in which manipulatives, 
discussion, and performance of tasks encourage student think-
ing, for small groups or the whole class.
discrete Quantitative in nature; countable. Compare with 
continuous.
distributive property of multiplication and division over 
addition The operations of multiplication and division may 
be carried on a sum or on addends of that sum.
dividend In division, the number being divided.
divisor In division, the number by which the dividend is di-
vided; the known factor. Compare with quotient.
E
equal-addition algorithm An alternative algorithm for sub-
traction that is based on the fact that adding or subtracting the 
same amount to the sum and one addend will not change the 
difference between the two numbers.
equal participation One of the basic principles for imple-
menting cooperative learning successfully, in which team 
members have equal opportunity to participate; an activity is 
not dominated by one member, nor can members choose not 
to participate. In traditional instruction, interchanges are often 
between the teacher and one student at a time. Compare with 
individual accountability and positive interdependence.
equilateral triangle A triangle with three equal, or con-
gruent, sides. Compare with isosceles triangle and scalene 
triangle.
estimation A reasonable guess, hypothesis, or conjecture 
based on numerical information. Compare with rounding.
even numbers The set of numbers divisible by 2 with no re-
mainder. Compare with odd numbers.
F
factors Numbers multiplied together.
ﬂ exible grouping The teacher uses different instructional 
groups appropriate to the task or situation.

formal operational stage Fourth stage of Piaget’s develop-
mental stages. Occurs around ages 11 to 13 when more sophis-
ticated ways of thinking about mathematics, including propor-
tional reasoning, propositional reasoning, and correlational 
reasoning, begin and continue to develop during the teenage 
years and into adulthood. Enables children and adults to form 
hypotheses, analyze situations to consider all factors that bear 
upon them, draw conclusions, and test them against reality. 
Compare with concrete operational stage, preoperational stage, 
and sensorimotor stage.
fundamental theorem of arithmetic Every composite num-
ber has only one set of prime factors.

shows the graphic arrangement of objects in rows and col-
umns, called rectangular arrays. Compare with Cartesian cross-

problem solving in mathematics and parallels the scientiﬁ c 
method.
Hindu-Arabic numeration system A base-10 system that de-
veloped in Asia and the Middle East. It is the number system 
that we use today.
histogram A type of bar graph that represents the frequency 
of data that have been grouped into several intervals. Histo-
grams are used to display numerical data, rather than categori-
cal data, as with bar graphs.
historical probability One of two types of probability, histor-
ical probability is based on information accumulated over time 
about a wide range of topics. These empirical data can then be 
used to predict the likelihood of certain events. Compare with 
mathematical probability.
holistic scoring rubric A judgment of overall quality of an 
assignment or task. Compare with analytical scoring rubric.
I
identity element A number that does not change the value of 
another number during an arithmetic operation. The number 
0 is an identity element for both addition and subtraction be-
cause adding or subtracting 0 does not change the value of a 
number. The number 1 is an identity element for both multipli-
cation and division because multiplying or dividing by 1 does 
not change the value of a number.
idiocentric Self-centered. Refers to children’s perspective on 
the world, including their understanding of space.
inclusion Rather than being placed in isolated special edu-
cation settings, more and more students with disabilities are 
being included in the regular classroom, sometimes with in-
structional support from aides or special education teachers. 
Teachers work with students with a variety of cognitive abili-
ties, learning styles, social problems, and physical challenges.
individual accountability One of the basic principles for im-
plementing cooperative learning successfully, in which team 
members are held accountable for contributions and results 
of the team effort. Every student on the team is responsible for 
learning the content and skill, and the team is accountable for 
all the team members’ being successful. Compare with equal 
participation and positive interdependence.
information processing A cognitive theory that uses a 
computer as a metaphor for learning. Instinctual behavior is 
similar to read only memory (ROM) in a computer; it is prepro-
grammed. Random access memory (RAM) is short-term mem-
ory the computer receives and stores temporarily, but does not 
retain when turned off. Learning becomes permanent when 
new ideas and experiences are transferred from short-term 
memory and stored in long-term memory for later retrieval and 
use. Information is stored in the computer’s permanent mem-
ory based on the needs and choices of the computer user.
integer A positive or negative whole number, including 0.

“What is the chance a six will come up when this die stops roll-
ing?” “What is the chance of drawing a yellow marble from the 
bag of colored marbles?” Compare with historical probability.
mean A measure of central tendency used to describe the 
middle value of a set of data. The mean is computed by sum-
ming all the data in a set and then dividing that sum by the 
number of data items. Also called mean average. Compare 
with median and mode.
mean average See mean.
meaning theory See constructivism.
measurement division When the known factor is the num-
ber belonging to each group and the unknown factor is the 
number of groups. Measurement division asks “How many 
groups of a known size can be made?” Also called repeated 
subtraction because the number in each group is repeatedly 
subtracted from the total. Compare with partitive division.
median A measure of central tendency used to describe the 
middle value of a set of data. The median is the middle number 
in a data set. Compare with mean and mode.
mode A measure of central tendency used to describe the 
middle value of a set of data. The mode is the number or re-
sponse that appears most frequently. Compare with mean and 
median.
multiple intelligences A theory, ﬁ rst proposed by Howard 
Gardner in 1983, that asserts that people are capable, or even 
gifted, in different ways and that no single description of intel-
ligence exists. Gardner initially identiﬁ ed seven intelligences: 
linguistic, logical/mathematical, spatial, body/kinesthetic, mu-
sical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. An eighth intelligence 
has since been added: naturalist.
multiplicand The second factor in a multiplication sentence 
such as 3  7  21 that names the number of objects in a set.
multiplier The ﬁ rst factor in a multiplication sentence such as 
3  7  21. It is called the multiplication operator or multiplier 
because it acts on the second factor.
N

square such as 4  4 and 5  5.
net A two-dimensional shape that can be cut, folded, and 
taped to form a geometric solid.
nominal number A number that is used to identify or name, 
although it may code other information. Compare with cardi-
nal number and ordinal number.

not show value with their size. Money is the most familiar non-
proportional material. For example, dimes are not 10 times as 
large as pennies, and dollar coins or bills are not 10 times as 
large as dimes. Compare with proportional materials.
normal distribution A graphic display of the number of stu-
dents at each percentile rank. Also called a bell curve.
norm-referenced test A standardized test that compares the 
scores of students who have taken the test to each other. The 
norm-referenced standardized test is reported in percentile 
scores from the lowest score of 1 percentile to the highest of 99 
percentile. Compare with criterion-referenced test.

considered at a particular time. For example, the “1” in 1
2 is the 
numerator. Compare with denominator.

nize persons and things and to hold mental images when the 
people or things can no longer be seen. Essential for recalling 
past experiences to connect with new experiences.
obtuse triangle A triangle having one angle larger than 90 
degrees. Compare with acute triangle and right triangle.
odd numbers The set of numbers not divisible by 2 evenly, 
and which cannot be organized into pairs. Compare with even 
numbers.
open-ended questions Questions that ask students to ex-
plain their reasoning.
order A basic thinking/learning skill that involves the ar-
rangement of objects, events, and ideas. Order has a begin-
ning, middle, and end, but placement within the order may be 
arbitrary. Compare with sequence and seriation.
ordinal number A number that is used to designate location 
in a sequence. Compare with cardinal number and nominal 
number.
outlier A piece of data that is widely distanced from other 
data on either the high or the low end of a distribution.
overlearning Learning, practicing, and drilling the same 
math fact, procedure, or algorithm many times to achieve the 
ability to use it without prompting.
P
partitive division When the number of groups is known but 
the size of each group is not known. The action involves dis-
tributing, or sharing, the number as evenly as possible into the 
given number of groups. Partitive division asks “How many are 
in each group?” Also called sharing division. Compare with 
measurement division.
percent The rate applied to the base. Example: 50% (the per-
cent) of 60 is 30. See also base and percentage.
percentage The amount or quantity derived when a percent 
is applied to a base. Example: 50% of 60 is 30 (the percentage). 
See also base and percent.
performance indicator Speciﬁ es how the student demon-
strates the performance objective. The objective in instruction 
becomes the performance indicator in assessment. The per-
formance indicator describes what the teacher expects to see 
the student do, say, write, or demonstrate the objective. It may 
include situation and the criterion for success.
performance objective Describes the expected student 
learning so that teachers and students understand what they 
are working toward. Performance objectives guide what the 
teacher teaches, what students are to learn, and what is going 
to be assessed during and after instruction.

hedron are Greek terms meaning “many” and “seat” (formed by 
two ﬂ at surfaces), so polyhedron means “many ﬂ at surfaces.”
positive interdependence One of the basic principles for im-
plementing cooperative learning successfully, in which team 
success is achieved through the successes and contributions 
of each member. Compare with equal participation and indi-
vidual accountability.
practice In a constructivist sense, providing many rich and 
stimulating experiences with a concept or skill rather than us-
ing repetition of the same experience.
preoperational stage Second stage of Piaget’s developmen-
tal stages. Occurs around ages 2 or 3 to 6 or 7 when children 
gradually change from being egocentric and dominated by 
their idiosyncratic perceptions of the world. They begin to be-
come aware of feelings and points of view of others in their 
world. Children develop symbol systems, including objects, 
pictures, actions, and language, to represent their experience. 
Compare with concrete operational stage, formal operational 
stage, and sensorimotor stage.
prime number A number that has only one set of factors—
the number 1 and itself. Compare with composite number.
principle of compensation The smaller a measurement 
unit is, the more of these units will be required to measure an 
attribute.
problem-based learning Classroom investigations. Thorp 
and Sage describe problem-based learning as “focused, expe-
riential learning (minds-on, hands-on) organized around the 
investigation and resolution of messy, real-world problems.”
problem-based projects or investigations Students inves-
tigate a problem (initiated by teacher or student) by exploring, 
applying concepts and skills, expanding ideas, and drawing 
conclusions.
process-oriented problem Focuses on the process students 
employ to solve a problem. For example, a calculator frees stu-
dents from computational boredom and allows them to con-
centrate on the process they use to ﬁ nd the answer. They can 
think about the problem itself rather than the computations the 
problem requires. Compare with product-oriented problem.
product The result of multiplication.
product-oriented problem Concentrates students’ efforts on 
getting the answer by using familiar algorithms. The answer, 
or the product, is the focus. Such problems enable students 
to apply their algorithms in real-life situations, and appreciate 
how empowering such algorithms are, in contrast to sterile 
rote computations performed from a set of skill problems on a 
worksheet. Compare with process-oriented problem.
proportional materials Place-value materials that show

and (5) icosahedron.
remainder (1) In take-away situations, the answer to the ques-
tion or problem that asks “how much is left” or “how many are 
left” after part of a set is removed. (2) In division, the groups or 
objects that are not evenly divided.
repeated addition A multiplication strategy that involves the 
total number belonging to multiple groups having the same 
number; related to skip counting. Compare with Cartesian 
cross-product and geometric interpretation.
repeated subtraction division See measurement division.

pare with equilateral triangle and isosceles triangle.
scope The range of topics, concepts, and skills to be taught.
scoring rubric Description added to each number in a 
rating scale to create a uniform understanding for levels of 
performance.
sensorimotor stage First stage of Piaget’s developmental 
stages. Occurs between birth and age 2 or 3. Foundations for 
later mental growth and mathematical understanding are de-
veloped at this stage. Compare with concrete operational stage, 
formal operational stage, and preoperational stage.
sequence (1) The organization of knowledge and skills across 
grade levels. (2) A basic thinking/learning skill that involves 
the arrangement of objects, events, and ideas. In sequence, 
order has meaning. Compare with order and seriation.

rangement of objects, events, and ideas. Arrangement is based 
on gradual changes of an attribute and is often used in mea-
surement. Compare with order and sequence.

same shape, but differ in size; the corresponding sides are pro-
portional. Compare with congruent.
simultaneous interaction A feature of cooperative learning 
that involves several students at the same time.
skip counting Counting in groups of 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . . Skip count-
ing encourages fast and ﬂ exible counting and is connected to 
multiplication and division.

phasizes the importance of social interactions in developing 
concepts.
space ﬁ gure A shape that has three dimensions, such as 
boxes and blocks, balls and world globes, cones, pyramids, 
and eggs.

and mathematical procedures is based on a belief that repeti-
tion establishes strong bonds.
sum In addition, the total found when adding numbers.

determine if students have mastered the concepts and skills 
and can apply them in problem-solving situations. Summative 
assessment provides accountability for students and for teach-
ers. Also called mastery assessment.

act reﬂ ection of form on opposite sides of a dividing line or 
plane.
T

moved, lost, eaten, or spent. In take-away situations, the ques-
tion or problem asks “how much is left” or “how many are left” 
after part of the set is removed. The answer is called the remain-
der. Compare with comparison subtraction, completion subtrac-
tion, and whole-part-part subtraction.
terminating decimal A fraction whose quotient eventually 
terminates when converted to a decimal with the division 
algorithm.
tessellation Tiling pattern made when a surface is completely 
covered with one geometric ﬁ gure or a combination of ﬁ gures 
in a repeating pattern.
test bias When items on a test provide an advantage or a dis-
advantage due to content or wording that is more familiar to 
one group than another. Minority students and those learning 
English may experience test bias, although students who speak 
English also interpret questions differently depending on geo-
graphic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds.
tracking Grouping students by ability and keeping students 
together for long periods. Tracking frequently works to the det-
riment of lower-ability students with instruction that deempha-
sizes concepts and overemphasizes isolated skills. Tracking 
also isolates the lower-ability students from the modeling and 
support of more proﬁ cient students. The lower-track students 
often have the least qualiﬁ ed and least experienced teachers 
and the least opportunity for a full and balanced curriculum.
traditional algorithm The algorithm that is most commonly 
used and taught in a culture.
transitivity Transferring the measurement characteristic of 
an object to another object in order to make a comparison.
translation Transformation in which an object is relocated in

quantities.
whole-part-part subtraction Identiﬁ es the size of a sub-
group within a larger group. The whole group has a common 
characteristic, but parts or subgroups have distinct characteris-
tics. Whole-part-part subtraction identiﬁ es membership in two 
subgroups that are included in the whole group. The number in 
one part of the whole is known, and the question posed is “how 
many belong” in the other part. Compare with comparison sub-
traction, completion subtraction, and takeaway subtraction.
Z
zone of proximal development The gap between current 
knowledge or skill and the desired knowledge or skill. Students 
are able to learn within their zone of proximal development. If 
students do not have the requisite background for learning, the 
teacher provides experiences that develop the foundation for 
successful learning.
