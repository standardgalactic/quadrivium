About the Authors
Danny Briere founded TeleChoice, Inc., a telecommunications consulting 
company, in 1985 and now serves as CEO of the company. Widely known 
throughout the telecommunications and networking industry, Danny has 
written more than 1,000 articles about telecommunications topics and has 
authored or edited eight books, including Wireless Home Networking For 
Dummies, 3rd Edition, and Smart Homes For Dummies, 3rd Edition. He is fre-
quently quoted by leading publications on telecommunications and technol-
ogy topics and can often be seen on major TV networks providing analysis on 
the latest communications news and breakthroughs. Danny lives in Mansfi eld 
Center, Connecticut with his wife and four children.
Pat Hurley is Director of Research for TeleChoice, Inc. specializing in emerg-
ing telecommunications and digital home technologies, particularly all the 
latest consumer electronics and access gear, including wireless LANs, DSL, 
cable modems, satellite services, and home-networking services. Pat fre-
quently consults with the leading telecommunications carriers, equipment 
vendors, consumer goods manufacturers, and other players in the tele-
communications and consumer electronics industries. Pat is the coauthor 
of Smart Homes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, Wireless Home Networking For 
Dummies, 3rd Edition, Wireless Network Hacks and Mods For Dummies, and 
Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 PC For Dummies. He lives in San Diego, 
California with his wife, a fi ery red-headed preschooler named Annabel, and 
two smelly dogs.


Dedication
Danny wants to thank his wife, Holly, and kids, who have endured their home 
theater being the test bed for just about every new technology known to 
mankind. They’ve had to learn the intricacies of beta testing everything from 
remarkably exciting motion-controlled TV to sadly disappointing Apple TV 
test gear. When their friends ask how to turn things on, the response is usu-
ally prefaced by, “Well, this week . . .” However, they also get to appreciate 
true breakthroughs, such as when they moved to RF control and no longer 
had to point in a certain direction to get something to happen. Ah, the good 
life! To all of them, thanks for their perseverance. 
Pat, as always, thanks his wife, Christine, for her infi nite patience. (Is it 
patience when one refrains from bonking his or her spouse over the head 
with a cast iron skillet?) He also thanks her for gamely smiling and nodding 
when he introduced, over and over, pictures of the newest future member 
of the Hurley family home theater, only to change his mind when he dis-
covered the next silicon (not silicone!) laden object of his desire. Pat’s 
daughter Annabel (hi princess — or is it mermaid princess today?) gets a 
special thanks as the primary consumer of home theater time in the Hurley 
household and as a four-year-old expert in using Harmony remotes, working 
through scratched DVDs, and participating in big-screen Wii marathons.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
Many folks provided us with their time, knowledge, and expertise as we 
researched and wrote this edition, including Jessica Loebig and Krista 
Weirzbiki at TiVo, Kate Brinks and Lloyd Klarke at Logitech Harmony, Steve 
Venuti at HDMI Licensing, Keith Claytor at Klipsch, Chris Fawcett at Sony, 
and Andy Parsons from Pioneer and the Blu-ray Disc Association. Special 
thanks go to Craig Eggers at Dolby, who’s been our go-to resource (along 
with Roger Dressler and Jeanne Alford) for all things surround sound for the 
past fi ve years.
The following folks helped with previous editions of this book and provides 
the knowledge base upon which we built this edition: Joel Silver at Imaging 
Science Foundation, Jeff Denenholz at X10 Ltd., Larry Becker at Crutchfi eld, 
Nick Carter and the rest of the crew at AudioRequest, Kaleo Willess and 
Roger Dressler at Dolby Laboratories, Shawn Gusz at G-NET Canada, John 
Dahl and Amy Brighouse from THX, Ltd., and all the people manning the 
booths at the past seven or eight CES shows in Las Vegas who let us stare 
and gape at their rear-projection, plasma, and LCD screens for hours on end. 
We’d thank them personally, but none of them gave us one.
Thanks also to our acquisition editors, Steve Hayes and Amy Fandrei (con-
grats on the baby Amy!), and especially to our project editor, Susan Pink. 
Susan, you do know we always ask for you, don’t you? So you’d better tell 
us now if you’ve had enough of Pat and Danny. Seriously though, thanks for 
making our writing clearer, easier to read, and just plain better!

Introduction
T
he onscreen image looks crisp and sharp, like a huge moving photo-
graph. You feel entranced. More to the point, you feel the immediate 
urge to own this video projector, provided it works with the DVD player and 
the rest of your fledgling home theater gear.
An enthusiastic salesperson sees your look and enters the demonstration 
room. “It’s really beautiful,” the salesperson proclaims. “That’s the 50-inch 
plasma unit that works in true 1080p at 16:9. Yup, she’s a dream.”
Moments like that make you wish that people came with a pause button — or 
at least an instant replay and color commentary.
For all the fun they bring and the good times they facilitate, home theaters 
(and their sundry technologies) come with a bewildering blizzard of terms 
and acronyms. Worse yet, it seems like everybody involved with the indus-
try either knows what the terms mean but can’t explain them or has no clue 
about the true meanings but spouts the terms anyway. And neither of those 
cases helps you make any sense of the whole thing.
That’s where the new and greatly improved third edition of Home Theater 
For Dummies makes its heroic entrance. (We’d cue up a low fog, some dra-
matic lighting, and that mysterious “something cool might happen anytime 
now” music to enhance the moment, but there’s only so much you can do in 
a book.) Even without the special effects, this book still rescues you from all 
kinds of home theater perils. Read on to find out how.
About This Book
The book takes you through the world of home theater from the bottom to 
the top. Starting with a broad look at the basics of home theater concepts 
and technology, Home Theater For Dummies presses onward with more 
detailed information about source devices, surround-sound gear, video dis-
play equipment, and PCs. The book even advises you about the theater room 
itself, giving guidance about everything from furniture to popcorn machines.
Best of all, this book delivers the information in the friendly, patient, and 
easy-to-understand manner that you know and expect from a title in the For 
Dummies line.

Home Theater For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Get ready for one of the most enjoyable trips of your life. With this book at 
your side, you’re ready for anything and everything that the industry (and 
those questionable salespeople at the local equipment store) can throw at you.
Conventions Used in This Book
Unlike its famous and prolific computer-oriented brethren, Home Theater For 
Dummies keeps things pretty simple in the conventions department. We use 
just a single bit of textual oddness that relates to Web sites. Any time we talk 
about a Web address, you see the site address formatted in a special font, 
like this: www.dummies.com.
Why? For one thing, the font makes the text stand out so that you know 
exactly what to type into your browser. (Besides, we think the production 
department got a special deal on that font, so they just like seeing it in the 
books as much as possible.)
Just the (Techie) Facts, Ma’am
Although everything in the book meets rigorous standards for comprehen-
sion, usability, and lack of pointless geekiness, a few technical tidbits slipped 
in accidentally. Well, they didn’t slip in accidentally; we wrote them that way.
At some point in the home theater process, you come face to face with tech-
nical tripe whether you want to or not. It’s better that you hear this stuff from 
us than from some name-tagged know-it-all on a sales floor.
Foolish Assumptions
To write this book, we had to spend a lot of time in malls, video stores, and 
movie theaters (that’s the hard part) doing “research.” While doing so, we 
pondered all kinds of questions concerning you, the reader. Who are you? 
Where are you? What did you eat for lunch? Which movies pique your inter-
est? How do your home theater desires line up with your budget? Queries 
like that fill our minds constantly, much to the consternation of our spouses, 
who prefer more useful thoughts like, “Shouldn’t you take out the trash?”
Because we never get to meet you in person, we end up making a few 
assumptions about you and what you want from this book. Here’s a peek at 
our thoughts about you:

3
 Introduction
 
 You love movies, television shows, or video games — or perhaps all three.
 
 You’ve experienced wide screens and surround sound at the theater, 
and you liked it.
 
 For one reason or another, a 19-inch TV set with a single built-in speaker 
doesn’t adequately meet your audio or video entertainment desires.
 
 You probably own a computer or will soon.
 
 You don’t shy away from high-tech products, but you also aren’t the 
first person on the block with the latest electronic goodie.
 
 You’ve heard a lot about digital TV (and the impending digital TV transi-
tion), and though it gives you a vaguely uneasy feeling, you know that 
you need to know more about it.
 
 The weird technicalities of home theater circle around you like planes 
buzzing King Kong.
 
 You know something about the Internet and the Web and probably have 
high-speed access to the Internet or will soon.
 
 You (or someone in your family) enjoy watching movies, listening to MP3 
audio, playing games, and possibly making movies on your computer.
If that describes you in detail or at least catches some of your shadow in 
passing, this book is for you.
How This Book Is Organized
Rather than haphazardly fling information at you and hope that some of it 
sticks, we clump related topics together into six parts. Here’s a peek at what 
they cover.
Part I: Welcome to the World 
of Home Theater
With home theater, the trek begins here, in Part I, which covers the basics of 
the basics, starting with a look at what home theater really means, includes, 
requires, and offers. From there, it looks at what it takes to get into a home the-
ater, in terms of space, timing, budget, and equipment. In Chapter 4, we get a 
little techie, but necessarily so, by giving you some solid insight into the terms 
and technologies that you will encounter. More and more, terms such as DLP, 
3LCD, and HDMI are on the shelf description tags when you go to Best Buy. 
You need this baseline knowledge for the rest of the book, so read Chapter 4 
closely. In fact, read it twice. (It’s even better the second time around.)

Home Theater For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Part II: Getting Video and Music 
into Your Theater: Source Devices
Home theater installations really contain two parts: source and presentation. 
Part II covers all kinds of sources, ranging from the prerecorded offerings 
of DVD players and VCRs to the over-the-air-and-through-the-sky action of 
broadcast TV and satellite dishes. As a bonus, this part even takes you on a 
tour of the personal video recorder (PVR), possibly the most groundbreaking 
entertainment device since the VCR itself, as well as state-of-the-art gaming 
platforms. (Pat performed that excruciating gaming research.) We also talk 
about your PC and the growing role it plays in sourcing audio, video, gaming, 
and other content for your system. To top that, we then tell you all you need 
to know about accessing the Internet for cool things like finding that episode 
of Lost that you missed.
Part III: Watching and Listening: 
Display and Control Devices
Part III focuses on the control and presentation aspects of your system, with 
in-depth looks at your receivers, controllers, speakers, and video displays. 
We look at all-in-one receivers and separates, such as controllers and power 
amps. On the video side, this part explores the strange world of television 
sets (which looked pretty simple until a few years ago when HDTV arrived on 
the scene) and video projection systems, which are home theater’s answer 
to the movie house’s silver screen and are becoming so affordable we think 
you’ll get one just so you can watch the Super Bowl on a 12-foot screen! Then, 
all eyes — er, ears — turn to audio for details about surround-sound systems, 
speakers, and more. Finally, we talk about remote controls — an often over-
looked area that deserves more attention. A remote control is your single big-
gest interface to the system, so we give you some options here.
Part IV: Putting It All Together
With your location selected, your gear picked out, and your walls trembling in 
fear, it’s time to install your theater, and Part IV guides you through the pro-
cess. In fact, hooking up your home theater is one of the harder parts of the 
experience. We start with the basics — the different types of cabling — and 
work our way up to connecting all the components into a working system. 
Toward the end of Part IV, we give you advice on how to link your home enter-
tainment system to other TVs and systems in the house. After all, you paid a 
lot of money for your theater — why not get the most use from it that you can?

5
 Introduction
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater 
Be All It Can Be
You might think that your home theater equipment is out-of-the-box ready 
to be plugged together and to start playing movies, but it’s not that simple. 
Almost every part of your system needs to be tuned like a nice grand piano. 
Although we use big words and phrases such as calibration and bass manage-
ment in this part, these merely relate to fine-tuning your system to itself and 
its environs. We also give you ideas for sprucing up your home theater with 
fancy lights and soundproofing (the latter of which is great for those late-
night sleepovers the kids have). We tell you how to access your home theater 
content from your car as well as from your cell phone (very cool) and laptop 
when out and about. We end the part with a cool look at the higher end of 
home theater — the things you can dream about during those long trips to 
Grandma’s.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Like all other For Dummies books, Home Theater For Dummies closes with a 
look at life from the humorous side with perky Part VI, the Part of Tens. Each 
chapter counts off a bunch of goodies that help you show off, troubleshoot, 
and generally accessorize your theater.
Icons Used in This Book
A lot of stuff is in here, and amidst all that material, the important details can 
sometimes be overlooked. To point out the important stuff (and highlight 
the technicalities you might want to avoid), the book relies on several help-
ful icons. Each icon identifies a particular type of information. Here’s a quick 
field guide to what each of these little billboards means.
 
Whenever you see the Remember icon, grab a handy mental highlighter (and 
maybe a real one, too) and mark the section because this information might 
come in handy at any moment, either now or in the future.
 
Everybody looks for tips (particularly in the stock market, the race track, and 
at your favorite restaurant). When a Tip icon shows up in Home Theater For 
Dummies, it points out information destined to simplify your life. You can’t go 
wrong with a Tip!

6
Home Theater For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
 
When a topic includes technology, technical tripe always finds its way into the 
book. At some point or another in the home theater experience, you need to 
know the geek-speak. Don’t fear paragraphs with these icons, but don’t rush 
to them, either. Just brace yourself for the technical onslaught, secure in the 
knowledge that this book protects you from the worst of the techno-drivel.
 
Nothing in your home theater really threatens personal peril — at least no 
more peril than you get from plugging in a toaster or accidentally watching 
a bad movie at your local theater. In those rare moments when inserting the 
right plug in the wrong socket could spell doom for your gear, the Warning 
icon hops into action. When you see one of these, stop for a moment, read the 
text, and double-check your progress before continuing.
Where to Go from Here
Apart from the pleasing shade of yellow on the cover, the best part of a For 
Dummies book is its open and available layout — you can start anywhere 
you want. If you already know the stuff in Chapter 1, dive in somewhere else 
instead. Where you start and what you read depends entirely on what you 
need to know right now.
Read over the Table of Contents to see whether any topics jump out at you. If 
nothing does, try finding a starting point in one of these:
 
 If you’re a newcomer to home theaters, start in Chapter 1. It gives you 
a good overview of how a home theater works, what it takes to put one 
together, and what your next steps are if you want to build one.
 
 Curious about the content — the movies and shows — appearing in 
your theater? Part II delves into DVD and VHS, plus satellite, broadcast, 
and cable TV. It even peers into the promising realm of personal video 
recorders (the TiVo is a good example) and PC-driven content.
 
 For an in-depth look at the sound and video presentation side of your 
entertainment empire, visit the chapters of Part III.
 
 For help getting your system connected and tweaked for the finest audio 
and video quality, skip on over to Part IV.
With that, leap into the world of home theater. Lights, camera, action — 
welcome to your adventure!

Par t I
Welcome to 
the World of 
Home Theater

In this part . . .
I
t’s important to start your adventure with some solid 
basics — what’s a home theater, why do you want one, 
and what do all the various terms mean?
Part I lays a foundation for talking about home theater. An 
understanding of all your options helps you not only on 
the showroom floor, but also when the time comes to install 
your gear and tune it so that it does what it was intended to 
do. Indeed, a lot of home theater setup is about making sure 
that your system is configured correctly for your environ-
ment, and to do that, you need to know what the system is 
supposed to be doing in the first place. (We’re sure there’s 
some pithy phrase, like “the cart before the horse,” to throw 
in, but we never use those correctly. So insert a phrase of 
your choice here.)
We follow up with some high-level basics about your home 
theater and its environment. We discuss where to put a 
home theater in your house and how to control it. We 
also delve into that hot topic — price. Then we walk you 
through all the things that make up the home theater at
 a high level — sources, outputs, PCs, cables, broadband, 
and so on.
And finally, we go a little deeper into the key terms, stan-
dards, and technologies that we use throughout the book. 
Here’s where we talk about a lot of the things that proba-
bly got you to buy this book in the first place — the alpha-
bet soup of home theater.
After you finish this part, you’ll know enough to be dan-
gerous in your local electronics store. (So be sure to read 
the rest of the book, too, so that you know how to control 
your now dangerous mind.)

Chapter 1
The Zen of Home Theater
In This Chapter
 Going Hollywood with home theater
 Finding room for a home theater
 Getting a stylish home theater on a budget
 Getting your money’s worth
W
hen you hear the term home theater, you probably think of big 
screens, cool sound, DVDs, CDs, and lots of remote controls sitting 
around your living room. We’re sure that football games, beer, and other fun 
images sneak into that image as well.
Home theater is truly for everyone — regardless of the size of your house or 
apartment, your economic wealth, or your taste in movies. And home theater 
is bound to mean something different to everyone. It’s not just about the 
gear — boxes, cables, remotes, DVDs, CDs, iPods, whatever. It’s really about 
embarking on what can be a great adventure.
Appreciating the Art 
of the Home Theater
Before you start on your home theater adventure, it’s critical to understand 
what the makers of the equipment, movies, standards, audio CDs, and so on 
mean when they say that they support home theater.
To the companies that produce the equipment and media, home theater is 
all about trying to recreate — in your home — the experience of watching 
a film in a movie theater, hearing the cheers of the crowd in a football sta-
dium, or feeling the reverberations of music at an open-air concert. Many of 
the people who devote themselves to creating atmosphere and mood using 
this medium consider what they do to be an art form. These are usually the 
people who are listed in the credits at the end of a movie.

10
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
When you take all the sensations of a movie theater and insert them in your 
living room, you’re on your way to successfully recreating that immersive feeling 
you get at the movies. All the improvements in sound compression, surround 
sound, digital screen imaging, and more have been done not to sell more equip-
ment at Circuit City or Wal-Mart but to try to perfect the ability to draw you into 
another world where you can experience a truly creative piece of work.
So a lot of this book is about explaining the technologies and ideas behind 
the home theater that you are going to put together, because it’s not just 
about seven speakers hooked into your stereo or a big honking TV screen. 
It’s about how to make sure everything is put in its proper place to maximize 
your home theater out-of-body experience — the way the media creators 
intended.
Fitting Home Theater’s Many 
Faces into All Kinds of Spaces
You’ve probably watched enough TV shows and movies about Hollywood 
and the rich and famous to know that, for some people, home theaters are 
as common as a kitchen or a bedroom. Indeed, home theaters were spawned 
from the necessity of filmmakers to preview footage, screen tests, and full 
movies. They gradually grew to be a status symbol among actors, too, and 
spread out from there.
In those early days, a home theater was pretty much literally that: a small the-
ater with Peerless Magnarc carbon-arc lamphouses and theater seating. They 
were often extensive and elaborate affairs — to match the surrounding house.
Today, you too can get into the act, and you’re lucky enough to have a broad 
range of projectors, screens, displays, seating, and equipment — heck, even 
popcorn machines — available to create your own home theater.
Probably the first big decision you have to make is where you want to put 
your home theater. It’s one thing to figure out where to put your 19-inch TV 
set; it’s another thing to think about where to put a big-screen TV with six (or 
more) speakers and associated A/V gear. Few people are prepared for how 
overpowering a full home theater setup can be in a small home, so it’s espe-
cially important to plan if you have limited space.
 
Defining your home theater space is a necessary first step. If the only place 
to put a TV is on the mantle above the fireplace, you’re looking at a flat-panel 
(plasma or LCD) TV and not much else. If you have to fit the whole system 
into the corner of the living room, that narrows the search as well. Remember, 
you don’t want to buy a home theater that just won’t fit into your home and 

11
 Chapter 1: The Zen of Home Theater
your lifestyle. A home theater is all about creating a theatrical atmosphere, so 
choose your spaces and work from there.
You can most certainly put a home theater in your present living room, your 
bedroom, or a room devoted to your theater. In the end, what matters is not 
so much the size but the way you establish the room’s ability to coax you 
into its sound field and video experience.
Budgeting for Home Theater
We believe in setting expectations. We don’t want to get you salivating over a 
52-inch LCD and a nice Harman Kardon system and then smack you over the 
head with an unrealistic price. Unfortunately, a quick stroll through any con-
sumer electronics store could lead you to believe that you can get all you need 
in an entry-level home-theater-in-a-box (without the video display) for just $199. 
However, that $199 system will be right for some people and not for others.
Exploring equipment and prices
So what does it cost to get into a home theater system? Table 1-1 gives you 
an idea of what you can spend. We’ve broken this table down by the roles 
that each group of audio/video (A/V) components plays in your home the-
ater. (Audio sources are devices that provide audio-only playback in your 
system, whereas video sources provide movies or TV content.) The A/V 
system provides the control for your home theater (meaning it lets you select 
what you want to watch or listen to) and does all the heavy lifting in terms of 
sending surround-sound signals to your speaker system. The video display, 
of course, is what you watch (think TV). We’ve also included some optional 
components — gaming systems and home theater PCs (which let you use a 
PC as a high-quality audio source device, or video source device, or both).

 Chapter 1: The Zen of Home Theater
 
Over time, components have been doing the integrating thing better and 
better. You can find really good DVD/VCR combos, for instance. Receivers can 
now control your video signals as well as audio ones. Personal video record-
ers are now a part of many digital cable and satellite set-top boxes. We talk 
about the advantages of individual components versus more integrated units 
in Chapter 11.
Also note that these prices are a snapshot in time — they are continually 
dropping, so don’t be surprised to find everything on this list available for 
even less money when you go shopping.
Certainly, you don’t need all the gear in Table 1-1. You can buy a nice all-in-
one home theater system and a smaller (but high-quality) flat-panel TV for 
not much more than $700. Of course, you can spend a lot more money, too. 
One thing is for sure: Pricing is competitive and is changing all the time. Two 
years ago, a lot of the gear listed in Table 1-1 cost twice as much as it does 
now. As we go to print, the first 50-inch plasma screen TVs for under $1,000 
are hitting the market.
 
To get a quick grasp on pricing, go to a few Web sites, such as www.circuit
city.com, www.plasmatvbuyingguide.com, and Pricegrabber.com to 
get a sense of the going rate for different items. Compare that with Table 1-1 
to get a sense of how much pricing has dropped just in the time it took for this 
book to hit the shelves.
Buying on a budget
Given that you are probably working within a budget, here are some ideas 
about what you can expect to buy and install for different total budget ranges:
 
 $0 to $500: Definitely the entry-level package for home theater, a system 
in the under-$500 range basically uses your existing TV (or includes an 
inexpensive flat-panel TV in the 27-inch range) and an entry-level all-in-
one home theater system package (which comes with all the speakers 
you need for surround sound and a receiver/DVD player combo). You 
can probably throw in a $50 VCR if you don’t already have one, but even 
the lowest level all-in-one home theater sets include DVD players. (Gotta 
have DVD!)
 
 $500 to $2,000: By spending a little more, you can go up a range in a 
number of the components and get HDTV into your home theater, which 
we highly recommend — especially because all TVs convert to digital 
in 2009! You can spend some of this money on a midsized flat-panel TV 
(perhaps in the 37- to 42-inch range), though with the way flat-panel 
prices are dropping, you may be able to get a 50-inch or larger flat-panel 
TV, while leaving money in your budget for audio equipment. Or if you 
need a bigger screen, consider a rear-projection TV; the 50-inch screens 

14
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
start at around $1,000. This price range has a range of options for better 
surround-sound systems, with packaged options available for your five 
surround-sound speakers plus your subwoofer. And you can buy a fairly 
good A/V receiver to drive the system. Top this all off with a portable MP3 
player and a DVD player for the car, and your kids will love you (more).
 
 $2,000 to $5,000: At this level, you start to create serious options for 
a very decent home theater system. You should be able to get a high-
quality 50-inch or bigger 1080p (this term refers to the resolution of 
the screen — 1080p displays are the highest available) flat-panel TV or 
an even larger LCD or DLP (digital light processor — a special micro-
mirror–based chip system) rear-projection unit with a great high-def pic-
ture (starting at around $1,500). You might make the move from DVD to 
Blu-ray at this budget level. (Entry-level Blu-ray disc players are hitting 
around $300 as we write.) On the audio side, you can spend $1,000 or 
so on a relatively fancy all-in-one system, but at this price level you can 
also start to get serious with separate components, getting a very good 
A/V receiver, DVD/CD player/recorder, personal video recorder, gaming 
system, surround-sound speakers, and potentially even more. At this 
price range, the average person can get a mighty fine system.
 
 $5,000 to $10,000: When you top $5,000 as your budget, you can start 
expanding in some wonderful ways by adding more throughout the 
house through multizone capabilities, whole-home audio, and univer-
sal remote-control capability, or you can continue to go up the ladder 
in terms of higher-quality separates. We swear by audio servers that 
store all your music in one box. Get one for the car, too, and have them 
sync up when you drive in the driveway. Front-projection TVs become 
a viable option in this price range; good projectors start around $2,000. 
No matter what you choose — flat-panel, rear-projection, or front-
projection — in this price range, you should expect a big (50-inch or more) 
high-definition display. Or you can get fancy with furniture. Good home 
theater seats start around $350 each. A high-quality universal remote 
control costs about $500.
 
 $10,000+: Above $10,000, the sky is truly the limit. For $10,000 to $20,000, 
you get to enjoy a lot of the next generation of home theater. At this point 
you’ll be buying the top-of-the-line 56-inch or larger plasma or LCD flat-
panel TVs, or a very high-end projection system. Your DVD player should 
be the best available and should play not only DVD but also Blu-ray discs. 
You probably want some extra amplifier equipment in the system, and 
you may also want to boost your controls, perhaps with a nice Control4 
wireless touch-screen control. If you get above $20,000, you are into 
high-end audiophile-type stuff all the way. Whole-home audio and video, 
integration with home automation systems, consultants — the works. 
Believe it or not, it’s not unusual for people to spend $1 million or more 
on a home theater. At that point, we think a lot of money is being paid for 
custom interior design, high-end projectors, and so on. Nothing is held 
back. To us, given more modest expectations, a $25,000 system is 
stunning in almost all senses of the word.

Getting Your Money’s Worth
In deciding how much to spend overall, we can give you only this advice: 
Your home entertainment system is probably one of the most-used parts of 
your home. It helps define your family, social life, business relationships, and 
so on. It’s important, but spend within your means. You also want to save 
something for the future. Building and later adding onto a home theater is 
fun, too.
One of the great things about home theater is that it’s modular, so you don’t 
have to buy the whole thing all at once. If you really want a great TV display, 
get it, and go cheaper on the other components. And when you’re ready 
to trade up, figure out what you want next. The better stereo stores have a 
trade-up policy that gives you credit toward getting something better. And 
then there’s always eBay (www.ebay.com) or similar auction sites, where 
you can get all sorts of gear in great condition — everyone is always trading 
in stuff to move to higher levels, so don’t feel pressured to do it all at once.
 
Realize that, even if you are installing home theater wiring and speakers into 
the walls and such, you’re not likely to ‘get that money back’ when you sell the 
house. People are leery of other people’s homegrown solutions — even the pro-
fessional ones — and equipment becomes outdated quickly in this industry. So if 
you’re going to do some remodeling and spend some money, recognize that you 
are doing it for yourself first, everyone else second, and by all means not for the 
money.
Indeed, a lot of this book is about getting your money’s worth out of whatever 
you buy. If you get an all-in-one home theater system for $199 from Radio 
Shack or a high-end system with, say, a $37,000 Faroudja projector, $18,000 
worth of MartinLogan Prodigy speakers, a $4,000 B&K receiver, and other simi-
larly priced components, you’re still going to need to figure out how to get the 
most out of the system. So stay tuned to find out how to get more per kHz, or 
disc, or channel, or whatever you track your home theater fun by.

onsumer electronics have played a major role throughout the years in 
defining not just how we live in our own homes but also how we live 
as a society. The radio, then black-and-white TV, then color TV, and then 
all the various adjuncts to the TV and radio — VCRs, gaming consoles, tape 
decks, and so on — have all helped define who we are and how we interact 
with each other. The edgier radio and TV shows over the years have had a 
profound social impact by acting out for us the crossing of various social bar-
riers — for instance, the first on-screen interracial kiss, the first portrayal of a 
woman president, and the first portrayal of a black president.
The home has grown around these devices, so when it comes time to put 
these together on a pedestal and proclaim them a “home theater,” this act 
seems to acknowledge the role that home electronics have come to play in 
our lifestyles.
The Basic Home Theater
So, what’s in a home theater then? Well, a home theater is largely what you 
make of it, but we think that at least three major elements constitute the core 
of a home theater:
 
 A large-screen display: Note that we do not say television. More and 
more, the receiver aspect of a television is divorced from the display 
aspect, in the form of set-top boxes, external TV tuners, computers, and 

18
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater
other source devices. Appropriately, the display is being optimized for 
its main purpose — displaying the wide range of video output from a 
home theater system. These displays can be huge. We’re talking greater 
than 120 inches diagonally, which is 10 feet for those of you who didn’t 
do the math!
 
 A digital video source: At a minimum, this means a DVD player; and for 
most folks, it will also mean a TV source (such as digital cable or a digi-
tal satellite TV service). We think DVD is a bottom-line must-have when 
you’re building a home theater because that’s the way most of us access 
the movies we want to watch.
 
 For most people, the digital video source includes a source (or sources) 
of high-definition video, from TV broadcasts or the high-definition-
capable Blu-ray disc player we talk about in Chapter 4.
 
 A surround-sound capability: You find out about the details of surround 
sound in a few pages, but you need to have surround sound to take full 
advantage of all the audio power stored in your DVD content. With sur-
round sound, you truly start mimicking the theater experience.
If you’re lacking any of these, you really don’t have a home theater. Without 
the display and surround sound, you lose the effect of the visual and audio 
experience, and without a digital video source, you just have a loud and big 
TV system. You really need all three.
But you need not stop there. You can get digital video up on your big screen 
display in all sorts of other great ways — besides a DVD player — and you 
can add great devices to enhance your overall experience. The rest of this 
chapter is devoted to exploring the boundaries of your home theater realm.
The Complete Home Theater
In our discussion of budgets in Chapter 1, we give you a peek at what a really 
fleshed-out home theater might contain. Here’s a fairly comprehensive list of 
what you typically put in your home theater (we leave out the all-in-one units 
because they merely integrate various combinations of these devices into 
one unit):
 
 Sources: These provide the content you watch or listen to.
 
• Audio cassette player/recorder
 
• CD player/recorder/MP3 player
 
• Turntable
 
• AM/FM tuner
 
• DVD player/recorder

19
 Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home 
 
• Blu-ray disc player
 
• VCR
 
• Personal video recorder (PVR, also called a digital video recorder 
[DVR] by some folks)
 
• Camcorder
 
• Satellite or cable set-top box
 
• Video/audio server
 
• Gaming console
 
• Home theater PC or Windows XP Media Center PC (a specific 
Microsoft software product; see Chapter 8)
 
 Receivers/controllers: The heart of the system, these feed content to 
your displays and speakers.
 
• A/V receiver
 
• Controller/decoder
 
• Power amplifier
 
 Displays: This is what you watch.
 
• Direct-view, rear-projection, or flat-panel TV display
 
• Front-projection system with separate display screen
 
 Speakers: These are what you listen to.
 
• Two front speakers
 
• One front center speaker
 
• Two side speakers
 
• Two or four rear speakers
 
• Subwoofer
 
 Connections: These are connections to content inside and outside your 
home.
 
• Over-the-air antenna
 
• Satellite or cable video feed
 
• Internet connectivity — preferably broadband, such as DSL or 
cable modem
 
• Home network — preferably both wired and wireless to make the 
connection between your Internet service and your home theater 
and your home theater and your PC (with Media Center Edition) or 
Mac (with Apple’s Front Row)

20
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater
 
 Accessories: These are devices that make your home-stored content 
accessible from elsewhere.
 
• Universal remote controls and touchpads
 
• Internet access devices
 
• Home media servers and digital media adapters
Naturally, as you extend your home theater to other points in your home, 
you can add to the quantities mentioned here, but most of the components 
are the same. You also might choose different qualities and (in the case of 
displays) sizes of these things, but the basic formula remains the same.
Using Your Existing Gear
A question that comes across most people’s minds when they look to 
upgrade to a home theater is whether any of their existing A/V gear can be 
used in their new home theater.
The answer usually is, “Well you probably can, but you lose a lot by doing so 
(unless the gear is less than two years old, and in some cases, even that is old).” 
If you are thinking about using existing equipment, consider the following:
 
 TVs: If it’s smaller than a 27-inch display, why bother? Home theater 
needs a big-screen display for maximum effect. More importantly, ask 
yourself this: Can my existing TV display HD (high-definition) pictures? If 
not, you’ll probably want to consider an upgrade. Particularly if that TV 
is also not capable of picking up the digital TV signals that will be broad-
cast by all TV stations starting in February 2009. Also check for features 
such as picture-in-picture, and make sure your TV has the right kinds of 
inputs to accept the latest and greatest source devices (look for HDMI or 
DVI, discussed in Chapter 13).
 
 TV size requirements are actually a mix of three things: the size of the 
display, the display’s resolution (or number of individual picture ele-
ments that make up the picture on your screen), and your viewing 
distance from the screen. In Chapter 13 we provide some concrete guid-
ance about the best size display for your particular home theater. For 
most home theaters, a bigger display is better, but if you’re planning on 
viewing from a relatively short distance (a few feet, for example), you 
might be better off with a relatively small screen.
 
 Receivers: Chances are that your receiver is an audio (stereo) receiver, 
which probably doesn’t have surround-sound processing capability, 
inputs for video gear, or built-in amplifiers for your surround-sound 
speakers. You can use an audio-only receiver as an amplifier to drive 
some speakers, but if you want to listen to the latest surround-sound 

21
 Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home 
capabilities, which are encoded on most DVDs and Blu-ray discs (and on 
many TV broadcasts), you’re going to need a new audio/video receiver, 
period. What’s more, if you have a lot of video sources, you’re going to 
want to switch among them — and for that you’ll need a receiver with 
sophisticated video switching.
 
 VCRs: As long as your VCR is a VHS hi-fi VCR, it’s just fine. But it won’t 
replace a DVD player, which has about four times the picture resolution 
of a VCR (meaning the picture is about twice as sharp and detailed). 
We feel that VCRs are something you keep in your home theater if you 
have a lot of old tapes that you still want to watch (probably homemade 
and full of priceless memories). You might consider finding a service or 
buying a device to convert these to digital formats that you can burn 
onto your own DVDs!
 
 CD players: Your CD player will probably work fine. Depending on your 
space constraints, however, you might just use your DVD player to play 
your CDs because the two are compatible. Over time, CD players will 
disappear from your system in favor of a combined disc playing/
recording unit.
 
 DVD players: Your DVD player will probably play fine, but if it can’t 
record, you’ll miss out. With the latest personal video recorders, you’ll 
want to archive and offload all sorts of content to DVDs, and for that, 
you’ll want a DVD player/recorder to burn the DVDs. Keep in mind that 
you can often use a PC (with the right software onboard) for the DVD 
recording functionality — we talk about PCs in the home theater in 
Chapter 8.
 
 Speakers: Chances are these are not going to be useful because you really 
want a set of speakers, not ones that are pieced together. Speakers work 
in tandem and therefore should have a similar foundation of performance. 
If you have a pair of stereo speakers that you can match into a complete 
set of surround-sound speakers from the same manufacturer, you might 
be able to use what you have (we recommend that you choose additional 
speakers that are timbre matched with your existing speakers).
 
 Other stuff: Most other stuff can work with your system. Turntables, 
cassette decks, laser disc players, and so on can plug in and play their 
part without any problems.
 
 Internet connection: Okay, your connection isn’t gear in the traditional 
sense, but still, if you’re using a dial-up connection, you should seri-
ously consider upgrading to broadband if you want your home theater to 
take advantage of the Internet. As present and future consumer devices 
become increasingly reliant on the Internet for accessing information and 
content, you’ll need a broadband connection to download this content.

Choosing a Room
 
As you build your home theater, all roads lead back to optimizing that illusion 
of participation, and where you put your system plays a big part. Here’s a list of 
things to think about when determining the right place for your home theater — 
and there are definitely wrong places to put your home theater:
 
 Think about lighting: The amount of ambient light in a room, day or 
night, can substantially affect the experience. A nice, dark room makes 
the room itself disappear when watching a film, enabling that suspen-
sion of disbelief we keep aspiring to. Think about how lights from other 
rooms or street lighting might affect the experience.
 
 Think about dimensions: You tend to get more awkward sound pat-
terns in perfectly square rooms. The best place to put the centerpiece of 
your system — the TV display — is along the short wall of a rectangular 
room, preferably a wall without windows or doors on it. Fully enclosed 
rooms are best for sound. You can pull heavy curtains across an open 
wall when you are watching films in your home theater.
 
 Think about sound: Although people typically place a couch up against 
a wall, with a home theater you want enough space behind you so that 
the sound can get in back of you and truly surround you. So the ideal 
position for the seating is more central to the room.
 
 Think about the picture: Sit close enough to your display to maximize 
the perceived size of the picture, but not so close that you see a some-
what grainy picture because you can see the lines on the TV set. The 
bigger your display, the farther back you need to be to not see the lines. 
Also think about angle of viewing — all displays have a preferred angle 
of viewing.
 
 Think about walls: A muted color or wall covering — bookcases are 
ideal — absorbs stray light. A dark gray or black room is best, or one 
with heavy, colored drapes. (Now you know why you see all those 
drapes and carpeted walls in theaters!) The last thing you want is a 
brightly colored high-gloss paint that reflects light, creating light ghosts 
to the sides of the screen! Think also about removing or covering mir-
rors and picture frames; they do the same thing.
 
 Take note of the front and rear wall surfaces because, in general, you 
want to control the way your sound reflects off these surfaces. Typically, 
you want the back wall to be a little reflective to help build a more gen-
eral sound field behind your seating area.
 
 Think about floors: Yup, the floors, too. Bare tile or wood causes acous-
tical reflections that mess up your sound field. A good rug can absorb 
stray sounds that can affect the audio crispness.

23
 Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home 
 
 Think about stray noise: Listen closely to your room for regular interfer-
ing sounds, such as a clock ticking or a fish tank pump. Consider moving 
these devices if you can. And if the sound is coming externally, such as 
from the dryer or washer, consider some cheap absorptive wall coverings 
to muffle it.
We talk about creating a home theater environment in more detail in Chapter 20.
Organizing Your Gear
The most obvious and easy place for all your home theater gear is where 
you historically have placed it — right next to the TV. And indeed, nothing is 
inherently wrong with this approach. However, we ask you to look ahead for 
a moment and think about the investment you’ll make in your home theater 
and how you’d like to take advantage of that throughout your home. To do 
this, you need to think of ways your home theater’s components can be used 
in a whole-home network. This whole-home planning can make your home 
theater itself better, too, because it facilitates connections between the home 
theater and other networks that might feed in to it, such as your cable con-
nection or your Internet connection.
Setting up a central wiring panel
Think about designating a space in your house as a central wiring panel where 
you can centrally house a lot of your whole-home infrastructure equipment 
(devices that let you connect the home theater to the rest of the house).
Remember that most of your commonly used, ultrasensitive electronics gear 
will probably go right next to your home theater. You are better off relegat-
ing the gear that you just “plug and forget” (such as video distribution panels 
that send your cable TV throughout the home) to a panel in an out-of-the-way 
place. Some of the devices that you might connect on a wiring panel include 
the following:
 
 Home cable interconnections with your cable company
 
 Home phone interconnections with your telephone company
 
 A centralized distribution point for satellite dish wiring, if you have one
 
 Cable, DSL, satellite, or ISDN modems and routers, if you have them
 
 Ethernet hubs or switches for your Internet connection

24
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater
You can also put items such as home servers and some of your central media 
equipment on the wiring panel if you don’t need to get to it regularly and you 
need the extra space. Multizone amplifiers or MP3 servers are examples of 
such equipment.
Appreciating the advantages of a central wiring panel
By designating a central wiring panel, you gain some huge benefits:
 
 Hiding wires: Your home theater gear has a lot of cables and can have 
a lot of gear you rarely touch. A well-integrated home theater setup has 
a lot of cables hidden in the walls or running out of sight. We’re talking 
not just component wiring (such as the wires between your DVD player 
and your A/V receiver) but also connections to your phone network 
(required by a satellite dish), to your Internet connection (could be 
wireless, but wireline is better long term), to your IR (infrared) remote-
control network (more on this in Chapter 15), and other connections. 
Think of your wiring panel as a place where everything can connect to 
everything else in the easiest fashion.
 
 Hiding hardware: Much of the hardware that facilitates home theater and 
whole-home networking (things such as power amps, video modulators, 
distribution panels, and punchdown blocks) is designed with function 
rather than form in mind. A central wiring panel can put this hardware out 
of view. And that means less clutter where you have the stuff that you get 
at the most, such as your VCR or your DVD player.
 
 Connecting at a single point: Having a central connection point makes 
it easier to get networks such as cable or your Internet-connected com-
puter LAN (Local Area Network) into the home theater. It also makes 
it easier for you to get movies and music out of your home theater and 
share them throughout the home or access them when traveling.
 
 Providing easy access: When you want to change the capabilities of 
your networks or troubleshoot a problem, having everything neatly 
arranged and easily accessible can eliminate a source of frustration.
The wiring panel should be in a place that is out of sight but easily accessible. It 
needs to have plenty of space and adequate power to run a great deal of equip-
ment. Then you can bring it up to the media hub in the home theater whatever 
you need, through a range of easily connected wiring plates that make your oth-
erwise unsightly mess of wires look both neat and more accessible.
Locating your wiring panel’s home
In the best-case scenario (like when you’ve struck it rich and are building 
a custom-designed home), you can create a dedicated room for your home 
theater and associated equipment — a central wiring panel just like modern 
offices and other commercial buildings have.

25
 Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home 
If we were starting a home from scratch this way, we’d try to design the 
wiring panel
 
 On the main floor of the house
 
 Near an outside wall for easy interconnection to incoming service feeds
 
 Above an accessible part of the basement (if you have a basement)
 
 With adequate lighting, ventilation, and climate protection (not in the 
garage, in other words)
 
 With adequate AC power line receptacles to power devices, such as 
video amplifiers, Ethernet hubs, and phone systems
Such a panel needn’t be too large. Most home theater equipment takes up 
one rack at the most.
Of course, the vast majority of homeowners or remodelers simply don’t have 
the luxury of adding a dedicated space for a wiring panel. In these cases, you 
have to try to make some part of the house do double duty as your wiring 
panel. A first stop is the place where your cable, telephone, and electrical 
connections currently come into the house. You can mount some plywood 
on the wall on which to mount your gear. Here are some other places to con-
sider locating your wiring panel:
 
 The utility or laundry room: The biggest disadvantage of this location is 
the potential for high humidity, so make sure your clothes dryer is well 
ventilated to the outdoors. Good ventilation also keeps all the dust and 
lint from your dryer out of your sensitive electronics.
 
 A protected garage: The potential for dust and extreme temperatures 
may make this location less than optimal for some homes, but the 
garage can be a useful location.
 
 The basement: Many people choose the basement for a central wiring 
node because it’s easy to run wires through a drop ceiling. The base-
ment can be a very good location, but keep in mind that basements can 
be both dusty and damp.
 
 A weather-protected outdoor panel: We recommend this location only 
as a last resort, but it could be acceptable in a place with a mild cli-
mate. We wouldn’t recommend putting any active electronics, such as 
Ethernet hubs or phone systems, out here.
An important thing to keep in mind is that the natural enemies of electrical 
and electronic equipment are moisture, dust, and temperature extremes. So 
locations that may work for someone in Florida or California may not make as 
much sense for your house in Maine.

26
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater
Setting up a hub
Your home’s wiring panel provides a centralized place for all sorts of whole-
home networks that connect into your home theater (and elsewhere). Within 
your home theater, wherever you happen to locate it, you also need a similar 
centralized connection point for all that A/V gear we discuss in Chapter 1.
For most people, central to this area is the A/V receiver. An important thing 
to consider up front is the capability of this receiver to act as the hub of your 
home theater. An A/V receiver should be capable of accepting the connec-
tions from just about every single piece of A/V gear in your home theater 
(with the exception, perhaps, of an HDTV tuner/set-top box) and providing a 
central connection and control point.
 
With the right pieces and parts and the right approach to making connections, 
your A/V receiver (or surround-sound decoder/controller, if you go with sepa-
rate components) should be the primary connection point in a home theater. 
With a small number of exceptions (mainly related to HDTV), you shouldn’t 
connect components directly to the TV or display unit. All your audio and 
video should be routed through the A/V receiver, which then switches — or 
distributes — these signals to your speakers and display. We discuss receiv-
ers in more detail in Chapter 11.
 
Switching is a cool concept that we want to make sure you understand. If you 
think of your receiver as a generic box with lots of cables coming into and 
going out of it, the switching capability of the device merely cross connects 
these lines. So let’s say you have a Sony PlayStation 3, an AudioReQuest audio 
CD server (with video output to the TV screen to select your CDs), a DVD 
player, a VCR, and a TiVo personal video recorder all connected to your A/V 
receiver, which in turn is connected to your display. In the past, you would 
have to link these in a daisy chain and press TV/video buttons and L1/L2 
channel selectors and the link to see what you want on the TV. With an A/V 
receiver with video switching onboard, you can switch among these video 
sources by merely turning a knob on the receiver or pressing a button on 
the remote. Simple as that. No more fudging, cursing, and screaming by your 
spouse that Desperate Housewives has already started and you’d better get the 
TV working now! (Not that that ever happened to Pat.)
 
Some folks feel that sending any video through the receiver’s video-switching 
circuitry slightly degrades the quality of this video. We think that, unless 
you’re talking about a really high-end HDTV system, you probably won’t see 
the difference. If you’re worried about your receiver degrading your video 
quality, try it both ways (with the source device connected through the 
receiver and connected directly to your display) and see which looks better to 
your eyes.

27
 Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home 
Discreetly installing all this whole-home wiring (and “local” cables within your 
home theater) for your home theater can be problematic and messy. Your 
home theater room, unlike your wiring panel, is meant to be a public space in 
your house, not a place where you can hide away unsightly bundles of wire 
and racks of equipment. So your aesthetic requirements will be higher.
The best solution to this problem is to design the room so that you have an 
enclosed equipment and connection area where you can put the equipment 
that you don’t need to physically access to watch a program or listen to 
something — such as special equipment needed for whole-home audio and 
video systems. Your equipment and connection area could be a well-
ventilated closet, if one is available. We’ve even seen sophisticated setups 
with a false wall behind the TV and equipment racks to allow access to the 
backs of all the gear (or pull-out shelves that give you easy access to the 
back, as well). If you have space for a rack, you can probably store a lot of 
your active components there, too.
If you can’t find a separate space for your gear, you can at least make your 
environment neater and more professional looking by hiding some of the 
wiring in the walls or in fake molding and by making the local connections 
available through wall outlets. You can use short cables to connect these out-
lets to the equipment itself. In this fashion, you don’t have lumpy wires travel-
ing under the rugs and cables that little children (or the dog) can easily grab.
Zoning inside your home
When most people think about a home theater, they think within a pretty 
confined box — the place where the home theater is going to be. And cer-
tainly, that’s the predominant focus of this book.
However, a major theme that we’ll hammer at (until you agree with us) is that 
you should spend a little extra money and be a little smarter in your planning 
so that you can access this great asset elsewhere around the house and from 
the Internet as well.
Creating zones around your house is a great way to extend your audio asset. 
When you buy your receiver or amplifier, the concept of multizone is going to 
come up. A multizone system allows you to access different sources and send 
them to independent outputs simultaneously. For example, your kids could 
be watching Rugrats in the living room, and you could be listening to Dunne 
Roman (www.dunneroman.com) in the kitchen. How cool is that!

28
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater
We don’t go into a lot of detail on multizone audio systems here; we cover 
them extensively in Chapter 18. But we want to mention it up front for the
following reasons:
 
 Planning for whole-home audio is a good reason why you are going to 
need to think outside just your home theater (and another reason why a 
wiring panel is a good idea).
 
 Multizone means extra wiring and cables, extra speakers, possibly an 
extra amplifier, possibly extra controls, and some extra cost, so you 
need to plan and budget for it. (But it’s well worth it.)
Doing It Yourself versus Hiring the Pros
A lot of home theater setup you can do yourself. However, if you want it done 
right, you may want to bring in experts to complement your work. If you 
don’t have the right electrical outlets at your desired electronics station, for 
instance, you might call in an electrical contractor to put in dedicated home-
run electrical cables (so you’re not on the same circuit as the dishwasher 
and don’t have electrical current spikes hitting your system all the time). 
Also, setting up front projection is an art and better left to professionals. And 
there’s nothing like having your system fine-tuned by a professional who can 
tell if your video and sound are just right. Still, you can do all this yourself, 
with some patience — and respect for the live conductors in your electrical 
system.
If you want a professional to set up your entire system, you probably need 
to shop in the high-end price range. We rarely see anyone brought in to help 
on systems less than $10,000, and it almost always takes a $25,000+ system 
to get most contractors excited. So if you are on the low end of the equation, 
you’ll probably do a lot yourself or rely heavily on the local installation ser-
vices of the store where you buy your equipment. Even if your dealer doesn’t 
want to do the entire installation for you, we suggest you see whether he or 
she can do a system calibration for you. If you buy online, expect to do most 
of the work yourself.
 
Home Theater For Dummies does not presume that you are going to hire 
anyone. You should be able to plan, design, and install a professional sound-
ing (and looking) home theater system after reading this book. We just want 
you to know your alternatives in case you get halfway through and need some 
help. Check out the sidebar, “Who can help if you need it?” for some ideas.

 Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home 
Who can help if you need it?
All sorts of people can help you if you need 
advice:
  Architect: If you’re building or renovating, 
an architect is probably involved. Home 
theater design usually isn’t an architect’s 
strong suit, but he or she can help you 
lay out the initial plans for your home and 
coordinate with other designers to get their 
respective visions on paper.
  Audio/video consultant: Your audio/video 
(A/V) consultant helps you select the right 
mix of components for your sight and sound 
systems and then integrates all those com-
ponents. Your A/V consultant makes sure 
that the appropriate wiring is run to sup-
port your installations and then installs the 
gear when you’re ready. If you’re installing 
a dedicated home theater, expect your A/V 
consultant to get involved with the archi-
tect early on, too, making recommenda-
tions for room sizes, building materials, and 
so on. The A/V consultant may also hand 
you off to a specialized home theater con-
sultant if the job is too complex for his or 
her comfort. (Home theater consultants get 
into additional details, such as soundproof-
ing, seating, lighting, and the room’s shape 
and construction.)
  Contractor/builder: The general contractor/
builder’s role is to direct the other specialty 
contractors and make sure that they carry 
out the intent of the designers. Passing cor-
rect information from one contractor (such 
as the home theater consultant) to the 
people doing the work (such as the cabinet-
maker who builds the home theater cabin-
etry) is crucial. The details are what count 
here, such as cutting out the right size cub-
byhole for the kitchen media center.
  Computer systems contractor: If you 
work at home or have complex computer-
networking needs, bringing in a com-
puter systems contractor to network your 
computer hardware and interface it to 
the appropriate systems can be a great 
timesaver.
  Electrical contractor: Your home theater 
may require additional or different electri-
cal wiring (for example, running dedicated 
electrical wiring to your media center).
  Home networking consultant: Your home 
networking consultant will help you create a 
wired computer network, or wireless com-
puter network, or both that can carry voice, 
data, and video all over your home. Many 
alarm companies, electricians, and others 
are expanding their services to include 
home networking. We’re big believers in 
home networking and think it should be a 
core part of your home theater, too. These 
folks can also help with a whole-home auto-
mation system that can control your home 
theater and automate things such as light-
ing, drapes, and even movie screens.
  Interior designer: This person is respon-
sible for making sure that your home the-
ater technology doesn’t stick out like a sore 
thumb. Installing a state-of-the-art home 
entertainment center in the living room 
is one thing; making it fit with the overall 
scheme of your home is another.
  Lighting consultant: Often an overlooked 
task on a to-do list, lighting design has an 
important effect on the ambiance of your 
home theater, so consider specialized light-
ing in key accent areas.
Whew! Did we leave anyone out? Depending 
on the amount of money you want to spend, you 
may indeed have this many people making your 
home theater a reality. A more modest project 
has fewer people stomping around your house. 
Also, many of the previously mentioned pro-
fessionals — A/V designers, for example — 
include their services when you purchase their 
equipment.

Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater
Which people get involved in your project depends on the size of your project 
and whether you are building a new home, renovating an old one, or simply 
making do with that spare room in the basement. In the end, it will vary 
according to what you’re trying to accomplish. If you plan to put a major home 
theater in your home — complete with theater seats, a popcorn and candy 
stand, and screen curtains — you may want to bring a home theater consultant 
into the process. However, we’ve seen some imaginative do-it-yourself (DIY) 
home theaters that traded love and patience for consultants and big bills, and 
the results were amazing.
 
Want some confidence that you can do this (and get some neat ideas for your 
own installation)? Check out the DIY home theater projects at www.home
theatertalk.com and www.hometheaterforum.com.
 
If you do bring in some help, make sure you choose advisors who share your 
vision of an ideal home theater. The people you choose should have experi-
ence with a broad range of home theaters, not just expensive or cheap ones. 
Find your home theater personality and match it with your contractor’s, and 
you’ll have a winning combination.
You might have a hard time finding some of these contractors. For the more 
traditional groups of professionals (such as architects), we tend to rely on 
word of mouth, recommendations from in-the-know friends, and a thorough 
review of the contractor’s references. For contractors who will be install-
ing your home’s electronics and wiring infrastructure, we do these same 
things, as well as check their credentials. The Custom Electronics Design & 
Installation Association, or CEDIA, has a rigorous training and qualification 
program for people who do nothing but build and install home theater sys-
tems for a living. There is a CEDIA Finder Service at www.cedia.net/
homeowners/finder.php. Many home theater magazine Web sites also 
have directories of contractors — for instance, you can find a listing of 
installers at Electronic House’s Installers Guide: www.electronichouse.

I
n the early days of corporate video conferencing, system designers strug-
gled to balance the audio and video needs for a video conference with the 
cost for the transmission to carry the signals (which was really expensive). 
Necessity being the mother of invention, a lot of the focus was on compress-
ing the audio and video to low data sizes and figuring out the right mix 
between the two.
One trend became clear rather quickly: When test subjects were presented 
with all the different variants and permutations possible for different trans-
mission speeds, they always preferred to have better audio at the price of 
video rather than the opposite. In other words, they preferred to accept 
crappy video rather than deal with bad audio.
Although you’d like to have the best of all possible worlds in all aspects of 
your home theater, we think you’ll probably focus on audio first (at least 
we’d recommend it) for three reasons:
 
 The video conferencing effect we just noted.
 
 The fact that your home theater also doubles as a home concert hall, so you 
want your audio CDs, MP3s, and other audio sources to sound perfect, too.
 
 Video display prices are dropping faster than any other device in home 
theater, so if you are going to put off one purchase, putting off the video 
display makes a lot of sense.
For these reasons, we start our discussion of home theater technologies with 
audio first.

32
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
Surrounding Yourself with Sound
Unless you plan on installing a 360-degree Cinema-in-the-Round screen in 
your home, just like you’d see at Disney World, video plays a confined (but 
still big) role in creating the home theater illusion of being “in the movie.” 
The real job of surrounding yourself in the scene falls to your multichannel 
surround-sound audio system.
Imagine that you see on the screen in front of you the soon-to-be victims of a 
firing squad, and that — from behind you — you hear the clicks of the rifles 
as they chamber a round. That sensation is brought to you by your rear-
channel-driven surround-sound system. Now, if you had heard that sound 
coming from in front of you — the traditional TV experience — it simply 
would not have the same impact because, in the “real” world, that click of the 
rifle would have to come from behind you. Which all goes to show that if you 
really want the dickens scared out of you, you need surround sound.
Two-channel sound versus 
multichannel surround sound
Most of us are used to age-old two-channel sound — that is, the stereo sound 
that gives us a left and a right speaker effect. Multichannel surround sound adds 
a front center speaker between the front left and right speakers and adding two 
surround speakers. More recent versions of surround sound add even more 
rear speakers and side surround speakers to enhance your surround-sound 
field (the latest version of Dolby Lab’s surround sound — Dolby TrueHD — 
can support up to 14 channels!). A subwoofer is part of almost all home 
theater setups, but as we discuss later in this chapter, a subwoofer is more 
a part of the bass management of the collective speakers than part of the 
surround-sound system itself. Nonetheless, something needs to shake the 
room when the dinosaur’s feet stomp the jeep in Jurassic Park!
 
To understand the impact of the concept of surround sound on your home 
theater, you need to understand a bit about encoding and decoding sound. 
When the master mixers at the movie studios create the audio track to go 
with the movie, they encode the music in very specific ways. They designate 
which channel (you can read speaker into that if you like) the specific sound 
goes through. In addition, each different channel is designed to provide spatial 
sound effects — meaning that the channels can work together to make sounds 
come from different locations relative to you, the listener. The goal is to 
decode those signals onto the correct channels to replicate the studio’s intent.

33
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio
So, let’s say that a squadron of jets in a scene from Top Gun is doing a fly-by 
of the carrier command bridge. If we were in the command bridge, we would 
hear the jets come in from the left, sweep across in front of us, and then 
disappear to the right and the rear as they turn off to the starboard side of 
the ship. If you are sitting in a well-tuned home theater, you should hear no 
differently. And as the bridge shakes, your subwoofers (and bass shakers, 
which we talk about in Chapter 22) provide you with the vibrations to make 
you feel like you’re actually there. Now we’re talking surround sound!
To get you to this point, the encoders have to designate on the movie or TV 
program soundtrack the specific sounds that, at specific times, are to be sent 
to specific channels in your system. The speakers connected to those chan-
nels are given those signals by your surround-sound–equipped A/V receiver 
(see Chapter 11), which properly decodes those tracks from the DVD or 
other video source. A home theater audio system needs to have it all correct 
from beginning to end.
In a two-channel system, you might hear some of that effect, in that it might 
get the left and right parts right. A two-channel system can’t help with the 
front to back movement, however, and that’s the critical part of a surround-
sound system — it surrounds you!
Understanding surround-sound lingo
For the most part, the entertainment industry boils down a lot of the sur-
round-sound terminology into numbers such as 2.0, 5.1, and 7.1. Sometimes 
these numbers refer to the playback system’s speaker configuration, and 
sometimes they refer to the audio signal format being delivered. The lingo 
can be confusing, especially when the number of speakers in your particular 
system doesn’t match the number of channels in your source — like when 
you play back a 5.1 channel recording on your 7.1 channel system — but it’s 
all perfectly normal for that to occur.
The first number represents the number of speakers or main audio channels 
involved, and the 1 or 0 after the decimal point indicates whether the system 
has a subwoofer or supports a low-frequency effects channel. Systems that 
end in 1 have a subwoofer or an effects channel. Here’s a rundown of the dif-
ferent numbers you’ll probably encounter and what they mean:
 
 2.0: Normal stereo — the kind with a left and a right channel — is 2.0 in 
surround-sound speak.
 
 5.1: This is the primary format for creating and delivering surround 
sound. It is in wide use in movie theaters, digital television, DVD-video 
and audio, and even the latest game consoles. Source signals have the 
five main channels and one LFE (low-frequency effects) bass channel. 
Playback systems usually have five main speakers and one subwoofer.

34
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
 
 5.1-channel-ready: Such an audio system has six discrete inputs to 
accept a 5.1 signal from a signal source such as a 5.1-channel DVD 
player. It does not necessarily mean that these products can decode sig-
nals to a 5.1-channel output. The best way to ferret out true 5.1 systems 
is by reading reviews of the devices before you buy. (We recommend 
many places to find these reviews in Chapter 23.)
 
 6.1: 6.1-channel systems have an additional surround channel called the 
back surround channel. This drives a speaker (or preferably two) situ-
ated right behind the viewers, in essence providing the same smooth 
flow in the back sound field that the center speaker enables in the front 
speaker group. Dozens of DVDs are encoded with extra back surround 
information for this back surround speaker, and these DVDs also play 
perfectly well on regular 5.1 systems.
 
 7.1: Not to be outdone, some have taken the 5.1 or 6.1 channel encoding 
on a DVD and used some computer horsepower to create two indepen-
dent back surround speakers for even more surround sound, making it 
7.1. Note that 7.1 is not a true discrete surround-sound format (no DVDs 
on the market have 7.1 channels of sound); instead, it refers to the manu-
facturers’ own systems used to derive two back surround channels from 
existing stereo (2.0), 5.1-, or even the 6.1-channel sources just mentioned.
 
 8.1 and beyond: You’ll probably hear about even higher designations — 
8.1, 9.1, 10.2, and so on. These are in the realm of the home theaterphile, 
and if you’re evaluating such gear, a home theater consultant is probably 
standing next to you, so just follow his or her recommendations. The 
newest systems (such as Dolby Digital Plus, discussed later in the 
chapter) can theoretically support systems up to 13.1. Wow!
Bass management
Bass management is how your home theater manages low-frequency sounds. 
Better A/V receivers and other controller devices have several options for 
handling the bass sounds in your system. If you have nice, big main speakers 
that have an effective bass range of their own (often called full-range speakers), 
you might pass all bass frequencies to them. If you want smaller speakers that 
can sit on a shelf or hang on the wall alongside your plasma TV, the bass fre-
quencies might fall to the subwoofer, which is a speaker designed to play low-
frequency sounds.
One area that causes a lot of confusion is the difference between the Low 
Frequency Effect channel (LFE), which is part of your movie/game/TV show 
soundtrack and the physical subwoofer channel on your receiver or amplifier. 
The LFE channel is encoded in the soundtrack of a DVD or other surround-sound

35
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio
source; the subwoofer channel is the connection on the back of your A/V 
receiver that provides amplified low-frequency sound signals to your sub-
woofer. The LFE channel is encoded in surround-sound material — it’s the .1 
in 5.1 and other surround-sound formats. This low frequency sound, along 
with the bass from any channels that cannot be reproduced by the small main 
speakers, is often sent to the subwoofer channel in your surround-sound 
system, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be sent exclusively to your sub-
woofer. For example, some people send these low-frequency sounds to both 
the subwoofer and to the front left and right speakers if said speakers are large. 
The bass management system in your A/V receiver (or A/V controller) lets you 
customize these settings to best fit your A/V system. (We discuss how to set 
this all up in Chapters 19 and 20.)
 
You don’t have to have a subwoofer to take advantage of the LFE channel 
because many normal left/right speakers can take these cues from your 
receiver and play the sound accordingly. But having a subwoofer gives you 
that stomach-rattling, vibrating-room effect at just the right times — an effect 
we’re sure you’ll want to take advantage of.
Dolby Galore
As we begin discussing surround-sound formats, things can get a bit compli-
cated, unfortunately. A host of different terms and brand names are applied to 
everything we just described, and these terms can get downright confusing.
When you start to optimize your home theater, however, you need to under-
stand these terms. Because you probably have some older gear in your home 
audio and video system already, and because some older movies use older 
encoding schemes, we mention older terms, too, so that you can have the big 
picture.
We start with Dolby Laboratories (www.dolby.com). You’ve probably seen 
Dolby on your cassette tape deck for years and seen advertisements for Dolby 
Digital at the beginning of movies. But you’ve probably never known exactly 
what Dolby does. Well, stand by, because we’re going to make you look smart 
on your next date at the movies.
Dolby surround sound
You have to go back a few years to get to where we are today. Although 
Dolby has been enhancing sound for decades, the true mother of all 
surround-sound encoding schemes is Dolby Surround (introduced in 1982), 

36
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
which encodes four analog audio channels into two channels for storage and 
transmission or both. If you play Dolby Surround on a normal stereo, you get 
two channels. If you play it on a Dolby Surround–enabled decoder device, the 
device separates the full four channels for playback. Many tens of millions of 
consumer products have been shipped with Dolby Surround Pro Logic (the 
current version of this system) decoding onboard. That’s a lot.
With Dolby Surround, the four channels encode front left, front center, front 
right, and monophonic surround as their channels. The left, center, and right 
channels are full-range channels, meaning that they carry the full range (20 Hz 
to 20 kHz) of audio frequencies. The fourth (rear) surround-sound channel is 
a limited bandwidth channel, meaning it carries only a subset of the frequency 
range (not the real low-frequency or high-frequency stuff).
At first, consumer audio/video receivers with Dolby Surround decoders 
could separate only the left, right, and monophonic surround speaker chan-
nels. However, with the advent of Dolby Pro Logic in 1987, receivers could 
decode the center channel as well. The consumer devices just took awhile to 
develop the same processing power that the more expensive movie theaters 
had onboard.
Dolby Pro Logic is what’s called a matrixed multichannel system, meaning that 
output channels are electronically derived from input channels. None of the 
four outputs are identical to the two inputs used to transport the encoded 
signals, but all the signals being output from the decoder are indeed present in 
the two-channel source — nothing new, such as reverb, is being added.
So with Dolby Pro Logic, you have four channels and five speakers, with the 
two surround speakers playing essentially the same monophonic sound. You 
often see a subwoofer channel on Pro Logic receivers as well; note that this 
is not a separate channel but is derived from the low-frequency information 
from the front channels.
One problem with the dual monophonic surround-sound channels is that, 
in some ways, they defeat the purpose of having surround sound. You can’t 
send information specifically to one speaker, as is done with a left or right 
front speaker. And because they have the same signal, they tend to create a 
localized sound field between the speakers — and that goes against surround 
sound’s goal of creating a large, diffuse background sound field. Proper place-
ment of the surround speakers on the side walls aiming across the listening 
area helps achieve the optimal results. (In Chapter 12, we discuss dipole 
speakers and how they can help with this.)
A newer version of Dolby Pro Logic, Dolby Pro Logic II, came out in 2001. 
The biggest new feature that Pro Logic II offers is a fuller sound experience 

37
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio
for two-channel stereo or Dolby Surround–encoded sources that were being 
played over 5.1-channel systems. Pro Logic II does extra processing and 
extends the Pro Logic work substantially. Importantly, Pro Logic II decodes 
the surround-sound speakers in full-bandwidth stereo and therefore provides 
a more complete rear sound field.
 
Just about all surround-sound decoders sold since 2002 or so support 
Dolby Pro Logic II. Most now support an even newer and more advanced 
version of Pro Logic — Pro Logic IIx, discussed next.
Dolby Pro Logic turns 7 (point 1!)
As more and more folks build 7.1-channel home theaters to support Dolby 
Digital EX (discussed in the next section), they find that they have two chan-
nels that aren’t being used when they view material that’s not multichannel 
encoded (for example, many DVDs of older material have a simple 2.0-channel 
Dolby Digital soundtrack) or even when playing regular stereo content.
To fill all seven speakers with sound, Dolby’s engineers came to the rescue 
with a new version of Dolby Pro Logic II called Pro Logic IIx. This system pro-
vides a full 6.1- or 7.1-channel output — meaning you can take any incoming 
stereo (2.0) or 5.1-channel signal and turn it into a 6.1- or 7.1-channel output 
that uses all the speakers in your home theater system. So don’t be afraid to 
go 7.1! Pro Logic IIx has come to your rescue!
Dolby Digital arrives on the scene
The advent of Dolby Digital in 1997 really started to make things interesting. 
As you would surmise, Dolby Digital is an all-digital surround format that han-
dles audio compression, so it’s available only for digital content. DVDs and 
HDTV use Dolby Digital (DVDs may also contain some other system, such as 
DTS, or Digital Theater Systems). To give you an idea of Dolby Digital’s reach 
in the market, by the beginning of 2006, more than 1 billion consumer devices 
had shipped with Dolby Digital onboard, and more than 7,600 films had been 
encoded in Dolby Digital. It should come as no surprise, then, that it’s the 
scheme we think your equipment should support.
 
Dolby Digital 5.1 represents the current minimum level of performance that 
you should require from your system. Also keep in mind that any receiver 
with Dolby Digital decoding can also decode Dolby Surround Pro Logic.

38
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
 
Although Dolby Digital is the more widely known consumer moniker, it also 
goes by the more techie name of AC-3, which is actually the name used in the 
official part of the DVD video standard (for “regular” non-HD-DVDs), as well as 
the ATSC (Advanced Television Standards Committee) standard for DTV and 
HDTV. (See Chapter 4 for more on this.) AC-3 is also part of the standards for 
HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs. As you can see, Dolby Digital is everywhere, and 
you definitely want your home theater gear to support it. Luckily, just about 
every home theater receiver built since the late ’90s supports Dolby Digital.
What’s so great about Dolby Digital is that it encodes six discrete audio 
channels. (Discrete means that the sound signal contained in each of the 
six available channels is distinct and independent from each of the others.) 
Remember that the older Dolby Surround encoded four channels onto two-
channel soundtracks, which often resulted in all sorts of bleed-overs between 
channels and less-than-clear demarcations in the sound details.
Because Dolby Digital has six clean channels, your receivers and controllers 
can precisely control the different elements of your sound mix. More impor-
tantly, the rear surround speakers are each fed by their own independent 
channels, enabling true spatial separation for that rear sound field. With this 
setup, when you hear that bullet whiz by or that starship warp overhead, the 
sound moving across your entire speaker system is smooth and controlled — 
and digital. This is the home theater your momma always warned you about!
 
Dolby’s ability to encode and decode information is only as strong as its 
source data. If it’s working with a two-channel stereo movie, you may see 
something like “Dolby Digital 2.0” on the package, designating that it is a 
stereo signal being encoded and decoded using Dolby Digital. All fine and 
dandy, but it’s still a stereo signal. However, if your receiver includes Dolby 
Pro Logic, Dolby Pro Logic II, or even Dolby Pro Logic IIx, the stereo signal 
on the disc can still be listened to as a multichannel surround signal, thereby 
allowing you to achieve full playback on your system.
 
We talk more about how your DVD, HDTV, and other gear supports Dolby 
Digital, and how to make sure it’s all set correctly, in later chapters, notably 
Chapter 6. For now, know that this is the baseline upon which you grow.
Dolby Digital Surround EX
Rear surround speakers are a relatively new development made possible by 
an additional surround channel that drives the center rear surround speaker. 
This is 6.1 in industry parlance. Dolby avoids 6.1 and calls it Dolby Digital 
Surround EX.

39
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio
The rear Surround EX channel does not have its own discrete channel. Instead, 
its signal is matrixed (intermixed) with the left and right surround channels, just 
like Dolby Pro Logic has the center speaker information encoded in the left and 
right front channels. When a Dolby Digital EX program is decoded, the three 
surround outputs are all derived from a 3-channel Pro Logic process — none of 
them are strictly discrete anymore. It is also the case that many conventional 5.1 
movies decode nicely with Dolby Digital EX processing, thus keeping the added 
back speakers active. Newer processors offer Pro Logic IIx technology, thereby 
deriving four separate surround outputs instead of three, making much more 
effective use of 7.1-speaker systems for all movie and music programs, whether 
Surround EX encoded or not.
 
The first consumer devices with Surround EX were based on licenses from 
Lucasfilm THX (www.thx.com), so you’ll also see it called THX Surround EX 
in stores and online when you’re shopping.
THX isn’t a surround-sound format itself but rather a certification and testing 
program for home (and movie) theater equipment and movies. So equipment 
such as A/V receivers and speakers may be THX certified, as may DVDs them-
selves. THX’s main mission is to create a set of standards for surround-sound 
playback and then certify the equipment or DVDs that meet those standards. 
A big part of these standards revolves around THX’s criteria for the levels 
and equalization of the sound sent to the surround speakers.
Many newer DVDs are encoded for Dolby Digital EX and have that extra chan-
nel of surround information onboard. Also, if you’re playing a regular Dolby 
Digital 5.1-channel DVD, a THX Ultra 2 decoder can simulate 6.1- or 7.1-channel 
surround by processing the audio information in the regular surround 
channels and sending the information to your rear surround speaker.
 
If you’re playing a movie (say on a DVD) that has been encoded using Dolby 
Digital EX, and you have only a regular Dolby Digital decoder in your A/V 
receiver, you won’t have any problems. You still get the full 5.1 surround 
sound you expect, with nothing missing. You just won’t get certain sounds re-
routed to the extra surround speakers behind you.
DTS: Bring It On!
Dolby is not the only game in town, although it clearly has the lead in the 
marketplace. Digital Theater Systems (DTS) has invented a competing 
lineup of surround-sound encoding schemes. The first movie to use DTS was 
Jurassic Park.

40
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
As with Dolby Digital, DTS Digital Surround provides 5.1 channels of digital 
audio. However, DTS uses less compression (higher data rate) than Dolby 
Digital. Where Dolby Digital encodes six channels with 384,000 or 448,000 
bits per second, DTS, in its higher-quality mode, encodes 1,536,000 bits per 
second, which many audiophiles believe delivers a better sound quality. Of 
course, that means that the DTS encoding takes up more space on a DVD, so 
the DVD doesn’t have as much room for extra features, such as foreign lan-
guages, commentaries, and multiple versions of the movie.
 
It’s an open question among experts as to which technology (Dolby Digital 
or DTS) sounds better or is a better choice. On the one hand, people point to 
DTS’s higher bit rate and say, “Aha! Better sound!” Others say, “Well, Dolby is 
just more efficient at encoding sound, so it can have just as good a sound qual-
ity with fewer bits.” You know what? Both can sound good. You’ll most likely 
use whatever’s encoded on the DVD or other programming you watch. Dolby 
is the most prevalent system, but DTS is also widespread. We suggest you 
choose receivers and other equipment that support both standards.
The DVD powers-that-be require all NTSC (the North American standard) 
DVDs to carry either a Dolby Digital or a PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) — a 
common digital audio format — soundtrack to ensure compatibility with all 
DVD players. Because DTS is an optional feature of DVDs, DTS has an uphill 
battle getting studios onboard because the space on DVDs is limited. (For 
these space reasons, most DVDs containing a DTS soundtrack are encoded 
at half the 1.536 Mbps rate mentioned to retain a sufficient bit rate for high-
quality video and other content.) Today, a few hundred DVDs are issued with 
the higher-quality (1.536 Mbps rate) DTS Digital Surround.
You might hear of some other DTS innovations:
 
 DTS-ES: DTS-ES Discrete uses existing digital multichannel technology to 
deliver the 5.1 channels of regular DTS. It also adds a discrete full-bandwidth 
back surround channel — meaning that each channel is individually 
encoded rather than being matrix decoded from the others. That additional 
channel may be played through one or two speakers, allowing for the ES  —
Extended Surround — that gives DTS-ES its name. More prevalent is the 
DTS-ES Matrix system, which is electrically identical to Dolby Digital EX but 
uses Neo:6 matrix decoding to derive the three surround outputs.
 
 DTS Neo:6: DTS Neo:6 Music and Neo:6 Cinema are decoding techniques 
for stereo or Dolby Surround–encoded two-channel sources. Neo:6 
Music keeps the front left and right channels intact while synthesizing 
the center and surround channels from the 2-channel source. Neo:6 
Cinema can create a 6.1-channel signal from 2-channel movie sources.

41
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio
 
The bottom line on DTS is that the DTS folks have some innovative algorithms, 
but the sheer prevalence of the Dolby solutions clearly makes Dolby Digital 
the most common choice for studios and home theater enthusiasts. Most A/V 
receivers offer both DTS and Dolby Digital options, so you can try them both 
and set your receiver (or choose your DVDs) according to your preference.
Understanding the Next Generation 
of Surround Sound
The Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES surround-sound formats that bring 6.1- or 
7.1-channel sound to your home theater are great. But time marches on, tech-
nology improves, and surround sound keeps getting better. So it should come 
as no surprise that both companies have something new up their sleeves.
The advent of improved digital connections between disc players or set-
top boxes and the receiver (connections such as HDMI, or High-Definition 
Multimedia) and the enhanced data capacities of entirely new formats of 
recorded high-definition content (HD-DVD and Blu-ray) have made it possible for 
Dolby and DTS to launch new and improved surround-sound formats that prom-
ise more channels, purer sound, and an improved surround-sound experience.
 
The new surround-sound formats we discuss in the coming sections are not 
widely available. The only place you’re likely to find them for the time being 
is on Blu-ray discs (or on an HD-DVD disc — but this format has already been 
discontinued, so unless you already bought one, you can safely ignore it). 
Eventually you may see these new surround-sound formats on TV broadcasts, 
in games, or on content downloaded from the Internet, but for now they’re 
only on Blu-ray discs.
Dolby Digital Plus
The folks at Dolby Laboratories have improved their super-popular Dolby Digital/
Dolby Digital EX system and have created Dolby Digital Plus. Dolby Digital Plus 
improves on Dolby Digital and EX by
 
 Increasing the bit rate: Dolby Digital Plus can be encoded with up to 6144 
Kbps (kilobits per second) of data, where Dolby Digital tops out at 640 Kbps. 
(448 Kbps is the maximum from current formats, however.) In Chapter 5, 
we point out that all else being equal, higher bit rates mean better sound 
quality because the audio signals need to be compressed less.

42
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
 
 Improving the encoding: Not only does Dolby Digital Plus provide a 
much higher bit rate, it also does a better job of encoding (or digitizing 
and compressing) sound. Therefore, at a given bit rate, you get better 
sound quality. Combine this with the vastly increased bit rate of Dolby 
Digital Plus, and you get great sound!
 
 Adding more channels: Dolby Digital Plus can provide up to 13.1 dis-
crete channels of sound (14 total speakers, including the subwoofer). 
You can really envelop yourself in the action with 14 speakers!
 
 Providing backward compatibility: Dolby Digital Plus decoders can 
automatically downconvert your sound to the older Dolby Digital for-
mats. So you can play Dolby Digital Plus programs on your older system 
without having to buy new hardware. And when you do upgrade, you 
gain all the advantages just mentioned. Because the conversion process 
from Dolby Digital Plus to Dolby Digital outputs a 640 Kbps Dolby Digital 
stream, your existing system, which normally tops out at 448 Kbps, can 
actually sound better than ever before.
One drawback of Dolby Digital Plus is that the very high bit rates it sup-
ports overwhelm the digital audio connections that are traditionally used 
to connect DVD players or set-top boxes to your receiver. If all you have 
on your receiver is coaxial or optical digital connections, you’ll still be able 
to listen to Dolby Digital Plus, but you’ll have to get by with using analog 
audio connections or by letting your DVD player downconvert to 640 Kbps 
Dolby Digital. If you have a newer receiver with an HDMI 1.3 connection, you 
won’t have this restriction and will get the full Dolby Digital Plus experience 
because the decoded signals can be carried as multichannel PCM over these 
high-bandwidth interfaces without sonic compromise.
 
Some receivers have HDMI connections but still can’t handle Dolby Digital 
Plus — you’ll need a receiver with HDMI 1.3 capabilities and an internal Dolby 
Digital Plus decoding capability. If your receiver doesn’t have these capabili-
ties, it won’t keep you from enjoying the benefits of Dolby Digital Plus, but 
you’ll need to use a set of analog connections or configure your receiver to 
send the Dolby Digital Plus signal as linear PCM instead of as a bitstream. We 
discuss this in further detail in Chapter 19.
Dolby Digital Plus is an optional format for Blu-ray discs, so any Blu-ray disc 
player should support Dolby Digital Plus, though not all discs will use the 
format. Dolby Digital Plus may also be used for other HDTV content — and 
may end up being encoded in a lot of the HDTV shows you get from your 
cable, satellite, or other TV service provider.

 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio
Dolby TrueHD
Dolby’s other new format — one that gets us excited! — is Dolby TrueHD. 
Like Dolby Digital Plus, this format can support up to 13.1 channels of 
surround-sound goodness.
The big difference is that Dolby TrueHD is a lossless format. That means that the 
sound being encoded into the Dolby TrueHD data stream will come out the far 
end (at the decoder in your home theater) exactly the same as it went in. For 
the first time ever, the home consumer will be able to experience multichan-
nel movie soundtracks exactly as they were heard in the mixing studio during 
content production. All other surround-sound formats we’ve discussed are 
lossy — some data is discarded in the compression/decompression process. 
(DTS-HD Master Audio, which we discuss in the next section, is also a loss-
less format.) With Dolby TrueHD, the audio track is bit-for-bit identical to the 
studio master.
 
Dolby TrueHD uses the same MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoding as 
DVD-Audio (which we discuss in Chapter 5), but with an even higher bit rate, 
which allows for more channels of high-resolution audio.
A lossy encoding system throws away bits of the audio (using sophisticated 
acoustic modeling that determines what your ears actually do and don’t hear) 
to achieve greater compression of the audio. Greater compression is a good 
thing if you have a limited amount of storage space on a disc or a limited 
amount of bandwidth (or data throughput) on your video transmission system 
(like cable or satellite). But if you have the space (or the bandwidth) — like 
Blu-ray does — you can compress your audio less and get better sound quality.
You probably won’t hear Dolby TrueHD on broadcast HDTV programming 
any time soon because of the bandwidth issues we just mentioned, but Dolby 
TrueHD support is included in Blu-ray disc players and many Blu-ray discs. 
So you’ll be able to enjoy some awesome lossless surround sound when you 
watch a movie in this new format.
 
Like Dolby Digital Plus, to listen to Dolby TrueHD, you need a receiver capable 
of decoding Dolby Digital Plus with an HDMI 1.3 connection (these are still 
pretty rare as we write, but gradually becoming more common). If you don’t 
have Dolby TrueHD decoding and HDMI 1.3 in your receiver, you use the 
Dolby TrueHD decoder in your DVD player and connect it to your receiver 
using either an HDMI 1.1 connection or a set of analog audio cables.

44
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
DTS-HD
The folks at DTS have developed their own lossless surround-sound format 
known as DTS-HD Master Audio. DTS-HD is available on Blu-ray discs and players, 
and can provide (to begin with) up to 7.1 channels of lossless surround sound 
when it’s used with one of these discs. There are two variants of DTS-HD:
 
 DTS-HD High-Resolution Audio: This format is roughly equivalent to 
Dolby Digital Plus, providing a compressed but higher-resolution sur-
round-sound format with up to 7.1 channels of 96 KHz, 24-bit surround 
sound. It’s used on Blu-ray discs when there isn’t enough space on the 
disc for the uncompressed Master Audio format, discussed next.
 
 DTS-HD Master Audio: This is the top dog of DTS audio formats, and can 
be thought of as DTS’s equivalent to Dolby’s TrueHD. Master Audio 
provides up to 7.1 channels of uncompressed surround-sound audio.
DTS-HD has the great feature of being backward compatible with older vari-
ants of DTS. So although you need a DTS-HD decoder to gain the full benefits 
of the lossless encoding that DTS-HD provides, you can still get great sound 
with your existing gear.
In fact, a DTS-HD-encoded Blu-ray disc — when connected to an existing DTS-
capable receiver — will be able to send a relatively high bit rate (1536 Kbps) 
surround signal to any existing DTS receiver. And although this same bit rate 
has been used on hundreds of conventional DVDs, this is about twice the bit 
rate of the average DVD using DTS encoding, providing a good boost in sound 
quality.
Of course, when you have a DTS-HD decoder in the loop, you’ll get that great 
lossless decoding and superb sound quality.
 
Just as with Dolby’s two new formats, both variants of DTS-HD require an 
HDMI 1.3 connection and a receiver with a built-in DTS-HD decoder if you want 
to decode the high-resolution surround sound inside your receiver. Without 
those two features in your receiver, you’ll need to use the DTS-HD decoder 
inside your Blu-ray disc player, along with either an HDMI 1.1 connection (for 
linear PCM) or a set of analog audio connections.
Other Key Audio Standards
In the realm of “music only” (and yes, we play a lot of music in our systems, 
in addition to movies and college basketball games and other video content), 
you might hear about a few other audio standards. We don’t spend a ton of 

45
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio
time beating these into your head, mainly because you don’t need to do a lot 
to your system to accommodate them. With the exception of MP3s (which might 
take some special gear), these are things that you just plug in, and they work.
I want my MP3
MP3 is great for online music trading and downloading because it uses a com-
pression scheme to make the files small enough to be easily downloaded. You 
don’t find any MP3 music encoded in movies on DVD, nor will you (typically) 
find MP3-encoded music in stores. MP3 comes into play when you start getting 
involved in online music downloading or when you want to move your CD col-
lection to a computer hard drive. We talk about these activities in more detail 
in Chapter 5.
MP3 is designed to be an efficient encoding system for taking big fat PCM 
music files and moving them to download-friendly computer files. MP3 trades 
a little sound quality for a lot of room. (It’s another of those lossy compres-
sion systems, which means that the system removes some information.) So 
MP3 files are typically ten times smaller than the corresponding PCM files on 
a compact disc.
 
In Chapter 5, we discuss computer audio files in greater detail, including an 
in-depth discussion of the MP3 system and other encoding systems used for 
these types of music files — such as the AAC files used by Apple’s iTunes and 
the WMA files used by Windows Media Player.
PCM is perfect
PCM (or Pulse Code Modulation) is not really perfect — nothing is. But it’s pretty 
darn close. PCM is an older but still vital system for encoding analog music into a 
digital format that can be saved on a computer or burned onto a CD.
We say that PCM is nearly perfect because it’s a lossless coding system, 
which means that what goes in comes out exactly the same, bit for bit. In a 
PCM world, none of the sound is thrown away. The only limitations to PCM 
are the accuracy, sample rate, and word length (the number of bits used to 
digitally capture a sound) of the analog-to-digital conversion process, all of 
which define the quality of the signal carried in the PCM format. If you have 
sharp ears and a good system, PCM-based files sound better than MP3s, for 
example. Traditional CDs are based on PCM, as are the sound files on many 
computers, such as .wav files on a Windows computer.

46
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
PCM isn’t the only lossless system out there. Another one is MLP, or Meridian 
Lossless Packing, which is used by the new DVD-Audio format we discuss 
in Chapter 5. Another new audio format is SACD, which we also discuss in 
Chapter 5. It uses its own coding format called DSD (or Direct Stream Digital).
 
You can also find some lossless codecs in the digital music file realm — 
Apple’s Apple Lossless compression system and Microsoft’s Windows Media 
Audio Lossless compression system, for example, are both lossless formats.
The bottom line here is that for the utmost in digital audio reproduction, 
lossless is the way to go.

W
e call the video portion of a home theater a display. Your display 
can be a direct-view television, a rear-projected television, a front-
projected screen, a plasma or LCD screen, or even a properly painted wall (as 
long as you combine it with a projector).
Whatever its form factor, the video aspect of your home theater tends to be 
the main focus for many people. Let’s face it — a big-screen display simply 
overpowers mere A/V source equipment and controllers. Big screens are just 
plain cool!
There’s a lot to know about video formats, though, and in this chapter, we lay 
the groundwork for a more detailed discussion of specific video options in 
Part III.
Learning to Talk Videoese
Before we talk about the different kinds of analog and digital video, it’s worth-
while to find out how to talk about video. Like any other technology, video 
has its own set of arcane terms and other jargon that makes casual listeners 
just want to give up. We promise not to lay too much on you here, but a few 
key concepts are essential:
 
 Resolution: Speaking in very general terms, resolution is basically the 
level of detail that your eyes (or a good pair of eyes, if yours have gotten 
a little blurry from too much time in front of the computer like ours 
have) can resolve, or see, on the screen. In the PC world, this is measured 
according to the number of pixels (the individual points of light and 
color) on your monitor. For example, older home-PC displays are set 

48
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
to show 800 x 600 pixels. The resolution of video systems are typically 
described by the vertical number (the smaller of the two) — usually 
by measuring the scan lines that move across your screen (from left to 
right) and by adding the number of these lines stacked on top of each 
other. Video systems typically display 480, 720, or 1080 of these lines 
(though some displays — many plasma TVs, for example — have a non-
standard number of lines such as 768).
 
 When you look at specs for a particular display, you might see 
resolution discussed in two related but different ways:
 
• Display resolution: Also called a display’s native resolution, this 
is simply the number of pixels or lines of resolution that the dis-
play has on its screen. Most digital TVs (with the exception of the 
nearly no longer available, traditional CRT tube TVs, discussed in 
Chapter 13) have a fixed display resolution — meaning that they 
are physically built with a certain number of pixels and anything 
they display on the screen will consist of that number of pixels, 
regardless of the resolution of the video signal going into the dis-
play. Display resolution is what it says it is — the measure of your 
display’s resolution.
 
• Input resolutions: Different video sources, such as analog TV, DVDs, 
and high-definition TV (HDTV) signals, have their own resolution. 
For example, HDTV signals have 720 or 1080 lines of resolution, and 
analog TV signals have 480 lines. A display’s input resolutions are 
simply the resolutions of the video signals that the TV can accept 
and display. As an example, a specific high-definition display may 
have a display resolution of 720 lines and be able to accept inputs 
of 480, 720, and 1,080 lines of resolution — but will display the 1080 
signal at the lower 720 resolution. We talk more about display and 
input resolutions in Chapters 13 and 14.
 
 Fields and frames: Frames are a holdover from the film world, where 
each individual picture on a reel of film is called a frame (and 24 of them 
flash by the projector bulb each second). When TV was developed, 
the technology of the day wouldn’t allow full frames to be displayed at 
the rate at which TV signals worked, so each frame was divided into 
two fields, each of which contained half the scan lines we discuss in 
the preceding bullet (all the odd lines in one field, and all the evens in 
the other). Traditional TV systems display 60 fields every second — 30 
frames per second — but the newest systems, discussed in the next 
bullet, can be capable of up to 60 frames per second.
 
 Scanning method: Up until very recently, just about all common video 
systems used interlaced scanning, which we describe in the preceding 
bullet. In an interlaced system, half the lines are drawn on the screen in 
one cycle of the video system, and the other half are drawn in the next 
cycle. (The lines are drawn not top to bottom but by weaving — or 
interlacing — every other line.) Because this happens really fast (each 

49
 Chapter 4: Get ting the Big (Video) Picture
set of lines is drawn 30 times per second), your eye can’t really tell that 
things are being drawn this way — unless you stop to think about the 
flickering you see and the way some vertical and diagonal lines on your 
TV screen appear jagged. Progressive scan systems (see Figure 4-1) draw 
all the lines (a whole frame) at the same time and can help reduce these 
characteristics. The effect is a picture that is more like film, which is 
what we’re shooting for in a home theater.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Comparing 
interlaced 
and 
progressive-
scan video.
 
Odd lines are field 1; even lines are field 
2.  Combined, they produce an interlaced
frame. In progressive scan, all lines are
drawn simultaneously
Note: Lines continue all the way across
the screen; they are truncated here for 
illustrative purposes

Switching from Analog to Digital
Television is undergoing some radical changes — and we’re not talking about 
programming. Like most other devices before it, the television is beginning 
to make the leap from the analog to the digital world. Unlike many of those 
devices, however, TV has been making the leap in a series of agonizingly 
slow steps. In this section, we discuss how this transition might affect your 
choices in the video world. We talk also about the various kinds of TVs you 
can buy.
The conversion from analog to digital and old-style TV to next-generation TV 
comes into play in many places:
 
 The encoding of the programming signal itself, whether it goes onto a 
DVD or over a cable to get to your home theater

50
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
 
 The transmission (or production) path that the signal takes in getting to 
your house
 
 The receiver — internal or external — that receives and decodes the 
signal for display
In the progression of standards and technical development, change is taking 
place along all three of these paths.
Understanding the old standard: 
The analog signal
The majority of television signals coming into homes are still analog. Analog 
TV signals reach homes through over-the-air broadcast TV, by traditional 
cable TV systems, and by satellite.
Making film into video
As if resolution and scan methods were not com-
plex enough, you may run into something called 
3:2 pulldown removal or correction, or simply 3:2 
pulldown. This is a process that deals with the 
fact that an extra field (screen) image appears 
when the 24-frames-per-second films are trans-
ferred to 30 frames (or 60 fields) per second for 
TV. See, when you take 24 frames and make them 
fill a 60-field space, your system copies each field 
two or three times, in alternating sequence, to fill 
the 60 fields required. This creates motion arti-
facts that appear like jerky movements on the 
screen when you look closely.
What 3:2 pulldown does is remove that extra 
third field, so the original balance between 
frames is restored. You want a progressive-scan 
DVD player with great 3:2 pulldown removal. 
You can tell how good it is by looking at sharp 
lines on the screen, such as telephone wires or 
porch railings. Many high-definition TVs have 
built-in 3:2 pulldown systems as well, in case 
your DVD player can’t do this for you.
With the advent of the Blu-ray disc player and 
the latest generations of high-definition TVs, 
you can now play movies in your home theater 
at their native 24 fps rate. That’s because Blu-
ray isn’t tied to the legacy 30 frames per second 
rate of TV. The system includes a special 24 
frames per second film mode, and many newer 
1080p HDTVs can support this mode, which 
is called 1080p24. If your TV and Blu-ray disc 
player support this mode (and the film you’re 
watching was thus recorded and encoded onto 
disc), you’ll be set for a great movie-watching 
experience without any of the film-to-video 
issues that the rest of us have been dealing with 
for decades! Lucky you!

51
 Chapter 4: Get ting the Big (Video) Picture
In North America, an analog system known as NTSC (National Television 
Standards Committee) has been in place for decades. (The standard is more 
than 60 years old, having been developed in the 1940s!) In fact, it hasn’t 
been changed or updated since the advent of color television in the 1960s. 
Although this system is capable of producing a surprisingly good picture 
under ideal circumstances, its analog nature makes it susceptible to various 
kinds of interference and signal degradation. Consequently, the picture can 
be downright awful by the time it gets to your television, which is why the TV 
world is slowly turning digital.
 
Analog television displays a maximum of 480 scan lines (525 total, but you can’t 
see them all because some are used for things such as closed captioning), dis-
plays 30 frames (60 fields) per second, and is an interlaced system. See “Learning 
to Talk Videoese,” earlier in this chapter, for explanations of these specs.
Just as the NTSC standard is common in North America (and Japan), a couple 
of other standards — known as PAL and SECAM — are common in other 
parts of the world. Unless you have a special TV designed for the purpose, 
you can’t tune in to PAL broadcasts with an NTSC TV or NTSC with a PAL TV. 
This is one reason why you can’t buy videotapes in many parts of the world 
and use them in the United States.
Anticipating the rise of digital TV
The move from analog to digital is well afoot. Millions of homes have some 
form of digital TV, but the conversion from analog to digital is still an evolv-
ing process. The key concept behind any kind of digital TV is that the audio 
and video programming is converted from an analog signal into a series of 
digital bits (a whole lot of ones and zeros). The primary technology behind 
any kind of digital TV (at least in the United States and Canada — other coun-
tries have their own variant of digital TV) is something called MPEG (Motion 
Picture Experts Group).
 
Several video and audio compression and digitization standards are based on 
MPEG. Most are named by adding a number to the end of MPEG. The MPEG-2 
standard is by far the most common in the video world, with MPEG-4 coming 
on strong. (Another, older standard, MPEG-1, is also supported by DVDs and is 
used for VideoCD, which is more common outside the United States.)
The digital television (cable or satellite) signal and DVDs that most people 
receive today use MPEG-2 as their encoding to digitally transport or store 
standard analog NTSC signals. This is an important fact to repeat: Often, 
when you use a digital TV system (such as a DSS satellite service like 
DIRECTV) or a prerecorded digital source (such as a DVD), you get an analog 

52
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
signal that has been transmitted or stored digitally. The signal itself — the 
program that goes into your TV — is often still analog. Digital over digital is 
our nirvana, and it will soon be the law of the land as analog TV gets turned 
off in 2009, as we discuss shortly.
As you might have suspected, high-definition TV — which is becoming much 
more widely available, but which still makes up only a portion of the total TV 
landscape — is digital all the way.
 
Even though the video signal coming out of a DVD player is NTSC (an inter-
laced format, as we mentioned previously), some DVD players can convert 
this into a progressive-scan version of NTSC, which you can use if you have a 
progressive-scan TV.
When this digitized signal gets to your house (over a digital cable system, a 
Direct Broadcast Satellite system, or on a DVD), a set-top box, satellite receiver, 
or DVD player converts the signal back to analog NTSC TV, which your TV 
understands and can display. This digital transmission signal coming into your 
house usually looks and sounds better than an analog one because the digital 
transmission path is cleaner and isn’t susceptible to the interference that usually 
messes up analog signals. The same is true of DVD versus analog sources, such 
as laser discs and VCR tapes. When it comes to TV, digital is just about always 
better.
You can get better-quality analog content on DVD, and higher-quality DVDs 
are available. For instance, you might run across Superbit DVD, which is a 
Sony system for superencoding (using more digital bits and bytes to store) 
DVD content. Superbit DVD follows the existing DVD format, so you don’t 
need a special player to play a Superbit DVD. These discs simply use storage 
space that’s normally taken up by fancy on-screen menus and extra features 
(such as movie trailers and outtakes) to store more encoding (about double 
the bits) for the movie signal itself. The result is a more stunning picture.
 
Now that Blu-ray disc players are on the market, you can get disc-based digital 
high-definition sources for your home theater. We talk about these new disc 
formats in Chapter 6.
 
The real takeaway we want you to understand here is that many things that 
are called “digital” — like most (but not all) digital cable, digital satellite TV 
services, and regular DVDs (that is, DVDs that aren’t using the new Blu-ray 
or HD-DVD formats) — provide you with a nice digital picture that is not high-
definition TV. These digital video signals are usually just the same resolution 
as the older analog TV signal — they’re simply stored and/or transmitted by 
digital systems. There’s nothing wrong with these digital systems (they’re 
great, in fact!), but we mention this because we have run into many people 
who think that digital cable or digital satellite or DVD is the same thing as 
HDTV, and that’s just not true.

53
 Chapter 4: Get ting the Big (Video) Picture
Looking toward the next 
generation of digital TV
Most of today’s digital television isn’t all it can be. Several years ago, the FCC 
(Federal Communications Commission, the controlling regulatory authority 
for broadcasters, cable companies, and telephone companies in the United 
States) brought together a big bunch of television industry folks. After a 
long, painful, and contentious process, the group came up with a new genera-
tion of digital TV. This new system goes by the catchy name ATSC (Advanced 
Television Standards Committee) and follows a bunch of new, higher-definition 
television standards.
 
On February 19, 2009, the FCC and the U.S. Congress have mandated that all 
broadcast (that is to say, over-the-air) television stations turn off their old 
analog broadcasting equipment and begin broadcasting only in digital ATSC 
format. This doesn’t mean that standard definition television is going away — 
it simply means that all broadcasts will be digital, even if the original source 
material was analog, standard definition NTSC. This DTV transition also means 
that anyone who uses an antenna to pick up their TV signals will need to have 
a digital ATSC receiver (either built into their TV or in a separate, standalone 
device). We talk about the DTV transition and its impact on your TV buying 
and using needs in Chapter 13.
Introducing ATSC
ATSC uses digital video signals (not analog ones) transmitted using digital 
technologies and played on TVs set up to display these digital signals. Even 
the connection to the TV itself is digital. “It’s digital all the way, baby,” as 
sportscaster Dick Vitale would say. (Did we mention we’re Duke Blue Devils 
fans, too? Nothing better than watching Duke basketball in high definition on 
the big screen!)
 
Many people call ATSC digital TV or DTV. We do, too, sometimes, but we’re 
going to stick with the name ATSC in this discussion to help keep the differ-
ence between ATSC and other digital television services (such as digital cable 
or digital satellite TV) distinct. Aren’t we user-friendly?
Even though ATSC is all digital, all the time, TVs designed for ATSC can also 
connect to good old analog NTSC systems. And some of the stuff coming in 
over an ATSC system is NTSC. For example, most commercials will probably 
continue to be taped using NTSC systems for quite some time, and the vast 
majority of reruns will be NTSC as well (although these NTSC signals will be 
carried digitally over the ATSC system).

54
Par t I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
 
ATSC television standards are different from the digital cable or satellite TV 
we discuss in the preceding section. To view them in all their glory (and we’ve 
seen enough of high-definition television to tell you that it is indeed glorious), 
you need to buy a newer, fancier, better, more expensive TV — an HDTV.
Exploring HDTV
When we talk about new ATSC-capable televisions, we’re talking a whole new 
ballgame (or at least a whole new way to watch a ballgame). It takes only a 
glance to see the striking difference between older NTSC displays and the 
new ATSC ones.
ATSC signals can be divided into different groups, depending on the signal’s 
resolution and the scanning method (which we discuss in the beginning of 
this chapter). They are further divided into
 
 SDTV (standard-definition television): These signals are about the same 
or a little better than NTSC. Note: A related category here is EDTV, or 
enhanced-definition television, which is essentially a widescreen version 
of NTSC.
 
 HDTV (high-definition television): HDTV has truly spectacular — dare 
we say filmlike? — picture quality.
Within the ATSC standard are eighteen SDTV, EDTV, and HDTV variations, 
but you’re most likely to see just six, as shown in Table 4-1.

 Chapter 4: Get ting the Big (Video) Picture
 
You sharp readers will probably note that we threw in an extra format that’s 
not currently available in any digital TV broadcast (or cable system or satellite 
system) but which may become available some day in the future. That’s the final 
one — 1080p — which has become something of a holy grail amongst TV manu-
facturers even though no 1080p signals are available to display on such a set. 
1080p is simply a progressive-scan variant of 1080i. The only movie/video pro-
gramming source of 1080p today is the Blu-ray disc. Certain video games on the 
new Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 may support it as well, but there 
are no, we repeat, no TV signals today or in the near future that will be 1080p. 
We mention it for the sake of completeness and because you’ll hear it all the time 
when you go shopping. We get into 1080p in more detail in the chapters in which 
we talk about TVs and displays (Chapters 13 and 14, to be precise).
 
From the breaking news department: Both major satellite TV providers 
(DIRECTV and DISH Network) announced in August 2008 (as we were going to 
print) that they will indeed begin broadcasting some of their HDTV program-
ming in 1080p. Specifically, both networks will be broadcasting pay-per-view 
(PPV) movies in 1080p; neither will broadcast their normal HDTV channels in 
the format yet. We haven’t seen this new programming yet, but we are very 
much looking forward to checking it out.
To take advantage of all the benefits of digital TV, you need a high-definition-
capable television and a TV tuner that can decode the ATSC signal. That tuner 
can be inside the display (just as most TVs have analog NTSC tuners), it can 
be in a separate tuner component, or it can even come inside a satellite TV 
receiver or cable set-top box.
Traditional televisions don’t have the internal circuitry to decode digital TV 
signals, and they generally don’t have screens that can display high-definition 
ATSC pictures in all their glory. (And HDTV is the big deal in this story — we 
focus our discussion on HDTV rather than SDTV.)
Traditional TVs aren’t even the right shape. The aspect ratio (the ratio of 
screen width to height) of HDTV signals is wider than that of NTSC signals. 
NTSC is 4:3; HDTV is 16:9. Figure 4-2 shows the difference in aspect ratios. 
The HDTV screen has an aspect ratio like the elongated screens in movie 
theaters. (You may have already been exposed to this aspect ratio because 
many movie DVDs today allow for this sort of viewing as an option. See the 
sidebar, “Wide, wider, widest: Aspect ratios,” later in this chapter.)
 
A lot of people see 4:3 and 16:9, do the math quickly in their heads, and think 
they are the same thing. It’s confusing because 4 and 3 are the square roots 
of 16 and 9. The actual math used to determine the ratio of screen width to 
screen height is 16 divided by 9 (which rounds out to 1.78) and 4 divided by 3 
(which is 1.33). So for a given display height, a 16:9 screen is about 34 percent 
wider than a 4:3 screen.

HDTV-capable TV sets, which became available at the end of 1998, are more 
expensive than traditional sets. However, prices have come down signifi-
cantly. Just three or four years ago, HDTVs often cost more than $2,000, but 
now you can get one for $500 or less — you can even get a good-sized (32-
inch) flat-panel LCD HDTV for about $500.
We talk a lot more about HDTVs in Chapters 13 and 14.
 
After the switch to digital TV is complete, you don’t have to pitch your old 
TVs. Special, separate digital TV tuners (much like set-top boxes used for 
older TVs on cable networks) enable you to watch DTV programming on older 
TVs. Of course, the picture quality and resolution won’t be as high as it would 
be with a new digital set, and you might not have a widescreen (16:9) aspect 
ratio, but you’ll see (at today’s resolutions and quality) the programming 
coming in over tomorrow’s digital networks. Again, we talk about these con-
verters in more detail in Chapter 13.
Wide, wider, widest: Aspect ratios
Aspect ratios are one of the more confusing 
parts of video, although they used to be simple. 
That’s because television and movie content 
was all about the same size, 4:3 (also known as 
1.33:1, meaning that the picture is 1.33 times as 
long as it is high). The Academy (as in, “I’d like 
to thank the Academy”) Standard before 1952 
was 1.37:1, so there was virtually no problem 
showing movies on TV.
However, as TV began to cut into Hollywood’s 
take at the theater, the quest was on to 
differentiate theater offerings in ways that 
could not be seen on TV. Thus, innovations such 
as widescreen film, Technicolor, and even 3-D 
were born.
Widescreen film was one of the innovations that 
survived and has since dominated the cinema. 
Today, you tend to find films in one of two wide-
screen aspect ratios:
  Academy Standard (or Flat), which has an 
aspect ratio of 1.85:1.

57
 Chapter 4: Get ting the Big (Video) Picture
  Anamorphic Scope (or Scope), which has 
an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Scope is also 
called Panavision or CinemaScope.
HDTV is specified at a 16:9, or 1.78:1, aspect 
ratio.
If your television isn’t widescreen and you want 
to watch a widescreen film, you have a problem. 
And the industry powers that be have come up 
with two solutions (other than “go out and buy 
a widescreen display”).
The most common approach in the past has 
been what’s called Pan and Scan. For each 
frame of a film, a decision is made as to what 
constitutes the action area. That part of the film 
frame is retained, and the rest is lost. What’s 
left is usually a fraction of the main frame, 
sometimes as little as 65 percent of it, and this 
can often leave out the best parts of a picture. 
Imagine some of the scenes from Gunfight at OK 
Corral with the two gunslingers at each end of 
the picture. One of the gunfighters would have 
to go off the screen in Pan and Scan.
The second (and growing more popular) 
approach is to display the original full image 
on the TV set without filling the whole screen. 
When watching content formatted for a wide-
screen TV (1.85:1, 2.35:1, and so on), you see 
black bars at the top and bottom of the image. 
This technique is known as letterboxing (after 
the effect of seeing an image through an open 
mail slot in a door). Conversely, when watching 
content formatted for TV (4:3) on a widescreen 
TV, you see black bars on the left and right of 
the images. This is known as windowboxing.
An obvious problem with viewing widescreen 
images on a normal 4:3 TV is that the image 
does not use all 480 scanning lines of the 
screen. Some of those 480 lines get used just to 
draw black bars instead of drawing video you 
actually watch. (Some 4:3 TVs use a technique 
called anamorphic squeeze to eliminate this 
issue.) This yields lower resolution, something 
that anamorphic formats attempt to resolve. 
Also known as 16:9 Enhanced, Widescreen 
Enhanced, or Enhanced for 16:9 Televisions, 
anamorphic presentation squeezes the image 
horizontally until the full 4:3 frame is filled. If you 
look at an anamorphic picture on a 4:3 screen, 
the picture appears somewhat distorted 
because everything is compressed, but the full 
480 lines of content are retained. Luckily, when 
you tell your DVD player you have a 4:3 screen, 
it puts the anamorphic image back into a let-
terbox. When played through a 16:9 player, the 
original width is presented, while maintaining 
the full 480 vertical lines of resolution.
Most DVDs have both a Pan and Scan and a 
widescreen format (either letterboxed or ana-
morphic) on a DVD. Because including both ver-
sions creates an added expense to the studios, 
some DVDs ship with just one format onboard, 
and some titles actually have different formats 
on different discs. Be sure to check before you 
buy a disc if this is important to you.
As an interesting note, there are a few examples 
(Pixar’s Finding Nemo being the most famous) 
where movie producers have specially modi-
fied their content to have different widescreen 
and 4:3 versions — so the folks with 4:3 displays 
aren’t robbed of part of the image while still fill-
ing their screens.

Your Theater: 
Source Devices

In this part . . .
P
art II builds on the basics with more detailed cover-
age of all the things that you might want to drive 
your home theater — the source devices that feed audio 
and video into your system.
We start at the, er, source of 21st-century entertainment — 
audio sources. These range from the venerable AM/FM tun-
ers up to the fanciest MP3 players. After that, it’s on to the 
video realm, where we talk about DVDs, VCRs, and PVRs 
(personal video recorders), and even how you can bore 
your neighbors with home movies. Yawn!
Then we discuss sources from outside your home — cable, 
broadcast TV, satellite, and even new services that offer 
you video on demand and other network-based content.
Then comes the fun stuff — the gaming systems. Whether 
your heart is in Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, or Sony 
Playstation 3, you’ll want to know how to set these up — 
even if you don’t have kids. PCs are on tap next, and we 
help you understand how to take advantage of all the 
audio and video sources that the Internet has to offer and 
how to get them into your home theater system. We help 
you understand how to download movies (legally) off the 
Internet to watch whenever you want to and how to 
record those episodes of The Office that you keep missing.
We close this part with the cool component in your home 
theater — content accessed over the Internet. Whether 
it’s watching YouTube videos or TV shows you down-
loaded — either via iTunes or with the help of some more 
specialized device such as Vudu — we’ll help you make 
your home theater Internet savvy.

A
 home theater is about more than just movies and TV. Most people 
spend as much money on the audio side of their home theaters as they 
do on their video equipment.
In this chapter, we discuss the components you might add to a home theater 
system for listening to prerecorded music and audio broadcasts (what we 
used to call radio back in the old days — but it’s more than just AM/FM now).
Checking Out Your CD Player Options
Since the CD format debuted in the 1980s, tens of billions of CDs have been 
pressed. So it goes without saying that you need a CD player in your home 
theater, right? Well, actually, that was a trick question.
Although you definitely want your home theater to have a device that can 
play CDs, you may not need (or want) a traditional CD player in your system. 
Your DVD player, which we think you absolutely must have in your home 
theater, can do double duty as your system’s CD player. You can also play 
CDs on the game consoles we talk about in Chapter 8, or you can use a home 
theater–ready PC, which we discuss in Chapter 9.
Despite this, you might want a standalone CD player (instead of using 
another device to play your CDs) for the following reasons:

62
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 You are shooting for the highest-quality CD reproduction: If you’re an 
audiophile, you might want to spend a considerable chunk of cash on a 
fancy, no-holds-barred, top-of-the-line CD player that can eke that last bit 
of musical fidelity out of a disc. If so, check out companies such as 
Arcam, Naim, and Rega, which make fancy and expensive ($1,000 and 
up) CD players.
 
 You want special CD features: Some people buy jukebox CD players 
that can hold hundreds of CDs (so they never need to load a new disc 
after the hours-long initial setup). Others want a CD player that can also 
burn (create) CDs. Keep in mind that these features are percolating over 
into the DVD world as well, but for now, the CD versions of these 
devices are much cheaper.
 
 You are creating a multizone system: In a multizone system (which we 
discuss in Chapter 10), you can listen to different source components in 
different rooms. For example, you can watch a movie on the DVD player 
in the home theater while the kids listen to a CD in the kitchen. You 
can’t do that if the DVD player is your only CD player.
 
These three reasons are all perfectly valid — for some people. Don’t let them 
scare you into buying a CD player. Today’s DVD players do a great job of 
playing back CDs, so skipping over the standalone CD player is a good way to 
save a few bucks.
 
All Blu-ray disc players currently on the market are capable of playing back 
CDs (although the first few models on the market back in 2006 couldn’t). So if 
you have (or are considering purchasing) a Blu-ray player, you probably don’t 
need a CD player.
Choosing a CD Player
So you know you want a standalone CD player, but which one? If you already 
have a CD player, go ahead and use it. The following list highlights some 
things you might want to look for if you choose to buy a CD player (or aren’t 
sure about the one you have):
 
 Digital outputs: You can often get better sound out of a CD player if you 
connect it to your receiver via a digital connection instead of an analog 
one. On the back of most CD players, you can find one (or both) of two 
kinds of digital outputs — optical and coaxial — which are equal in 
quality. (We discuss these in Chapter 16.) The key thing to consider, 
however, is finding out what kind of inputs you have on your receiver 
and buying your CD player accordingly.

63
 Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music
 
 The ability to play CD-Rs, CD-RWs, WMAs, and MP3s: If you’re into 
burning your own CDs or like to listen to others’ homemade CDs, make 
sure the player you buy has these buzzwords on the box. Otherwise, 
you won’t be able to listen to those homemade discs.
 
 Multidisc capability: If you like to load up the CD player with a bunch 
of CDs, consider a CD changer, which usually holds five to ten discs, or a 
CD jukebox that can hold hundreds.
 
 Remote control: Many manufacturers have special connectors that 
can go between their components (such as a CD player and a receiver) 
to facilitate controlling everything from a single remote control. For 
example, with Sony’s BRAVIA-Link, a Sony receiver and remote can 
control a whole bunch of different Sony devices. As you shop for a CD 
player, keep your receiver in mind, but if you’re set on, say, a Sony CD 
player and a Pioneer receiver, don’t let the remote options hold you 
back. It’s very easy to get a universal remote control that can operate 
gear from different vendors.
In addition, always look for some basic quality measures when you’re 
choosing gear. For example, does the CD tray open and close smoothly? Can 
you read the display from across the room? Before you buy, always try to 
test drive gear in the showroom or your home (if you’re shopping at the 
high end).
The New Kids on the Block — 
SACD and DVD-A
The CD is overwhelmingly the most common source of prerecorded music in 
a disc format, but around the turn of the millennium, two new formats hit the 
streets — SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc) and the DVD-Audio disc.
Both formats are designed to sound better than a CD while maintaining that 
familiar, 12cm (quick — grab that metric converter) disc format. Although 
you may remember the marketing tag line, “Perfect sound, forever,” from 
when CDs debuted, SACD and DVD-A have managed to improve upon the now 
old-fashioned CD:
 
 Sampling: SACD uses very small sample sizes but records them 64 
times more often than regular CDs. The DVD-Audio system uses a lower 
sampling rate (still two or more times faster than CD) but a much larger 
sample (20 bits or more, compared with 16 for CDs). Either way, you get 
higher audio frequencies with less noise and thus greater dynamic range 
(the difference between the quietest and loudest musical passages on 
the disc).

64
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 Multichannel format: Because the discs can hold more data than the 
older CD format, record companies can release DVD-Audio and SACD 
discs in both traditional 2-channel (stereo) and home theater–friendly 
5.1-channel formats (with five channels of surround sound and a 
subwoofer channel). Some folks don’t particularly like the surround 
sound for music; they say it makes sense only for movies, where things 
are happening all around you. But lots of others, us included, like 
surround sound for at least some of the music we listen to.
 
 Some of the early SACD players didn’t support the multichannel format, 
though all the current models we know of do. Also, not all SACD or 
DVD-Audio discs are recorded in surround-sound format.
Both the SACD and the DVD-A have been tested by the experts, measured by 
the measurers, and reviewed by the reviewers, and the consensus is that 
both sound better than CD. How much better is a matter of great debate, 
but in a high-quality system, with a good recording, you’ll probably be happy 
to have one of these systems. Before you buy, though, keep three things 
in mind:
 
 You can’t find much material in either of these formats . . . and you 
may never be able to. Chances are, you can’t buy all your favorites in 
these formats. A lot of classic recordings have been reissued in one or 
the other format, but the number is still small compared to all the music 
out there. For the most part, these formats have become niche players, 
and small record labels focused on audio enthusiasts are the primary 
folks still putting out discs in these formats.
 
 Not all players can play both formats. Unless you are committed to 
only one or the other format (SACD or DVD-A), make sure you choose 
a “universal” player that can play CD, DVD, SACD, and DVD-A. Pay 
attention because some manufacturers (notably Sony, who was the 
primary technical supporter of SACD) don’t make many (or even any) 
universal players.
 
 Most SACD players and DVD-Audio players do play regular CDs and 
regular DVDs, which is nice. Look for ones that can play MP3s, CD-Rs, 
and CD-RWs as well, so that you can play homemade CDs, too.
 
 Because of copy-protection concerns, you might not be able to 
connect your DVD-Audio or SACD player to your receiver digitally. 
This means that all that high-resolution audio must travel to your 
receiver in the analog domain, making the audio more susceptible to 
picking up noises or generally degrading during its trip to your ears. To 
make matters worse, multichannel systems require six of these analog 
cables. Ugh. Some manufacturers of disc players and receivers have 
implemented a version of the HDMI cabling system (see Chapter 16 for 
more on HDMI) that will let you make a digital connection — you’ll need 
to carefully check the documentation of both your disc player and your 
receiver to see if this will work for you.

65
 Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music
 
Many home theater receivers have only a single set of multichannel audio 
inputs. So if you use them to connect an SACD/DVD-A player, they won’t be 
available for other multichannel audio inputs (such as an external surround-
sound decoder or a DVD or Blu-ray player with a built-in surround-sound 
decoder). Keep that in mind as you’re shopping around.
 
Neither SACD nor DVD-Audio have taken off in the marketplace. Both formats 
sound great, but many folks have begun to move toward online music (such 
as Apple’s iTunes Music Store) and computer-based audio and away from 
these higher-quality, disc-based audio formats. We think that you can’t go 
wrong with a nice universal disc player that handles both formats, but unless 
you’re really an audiophile and have (or plan to buy) a bunch of discs in these 
formats, you don’t have to spend too much time worrying about SACD or 
DVD-Audio. The bottom line: Get a universal player if the DVD player you’re 
shopping for includes this functionality, but don’t go out of your way for one 
of these formats unless you’re sure you’re going to be using it.
Many SACD discs, like ABKO Records’s remastered editions of the classic 
1960s Rolling Stones CDs, are dual layer. This means there is a layer 
of CD data and a layer of SACD data on the same disc, so you can play the 
same disc in your car and in your home theater SACD player. You can’t do 
that with a DVD-Audio disc today — at least not until someone comes 
up with dual-layer DVD-A discs. However, discs known as DualDiscs (www.
dualdisc.com) include a CD on one side and a DVD on the other. Note that 
this isn’t DVD-Audio but rather a regular DVD that can include video and 
even a surround-sound mix of the record but isn’t in the higher-resolution 
DVD-Audio format.
Moving Computer Audio into 
Your Home Theater
The really big trend in audio these days (for the past several years, in fact) is 
computer-based audio files. At the simplest level, these files are just like any 
other file on your computer, except they contain digitally encoded music files 
that you can play back on your computer, on a portable device, or in your 
home theater.
MP3 is the most common format for digitally storing music and other audio 
files on a computer or computer-like device, but it’s not the only format 
out there. A few others, such as Microsoft’s Windows Media (WMA) and 
Advanced Audio Codec (or AAC, used by Apple’s iTunes Music Store), are 
also incredibly common — as are the formats most often used for music 
purchased on the Internet.

66
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
We use the term MP3 to refer to online music because it’s still the most 
common music format, but online music files may be encoded using other file 
formats (as we discuss throughout the chapter).
MP3 mania has exploded worldwide over the past few years, initially because 
online services such as Napster (now dead as a file-sharing program but 
reborn as an online music store — www.napster.com) and KaZaa (www.
kazaa.com) have enabled people to share and download songs converted 
from CDs to the MP3 format. MP3 has retained its popularity because its 
small file size has made it an attractive system for carrying music around on 
computer-like portable audio players, such as our (and everybody’s!) current 
favorite, Apple’s iPod (www.apple.com/ipod), or Microsoft’s Zune (www.
zune.com).
Lots of people are moving their MP3 files beyond the PC and the portable 
player and are beginning to find ways to incorporate MP3 music into the 
home theater. This makes a lot of sense to us — why not listen to all your 
MP3s on the highest-quality audio system in the house?
Learning about digital audio file types
As we mention in the preceding section, MP3 is not the only game in town 
when it comes to digital audio file formats — other formats, such as AAC 
and WMA, are becoming increasingly popular due to their use in online 
music stores.
These audio formats have two main categories (often called codecs — 
from their function, which is to compress and decompress music into digital 
files). The first category is lossless codecs. This means that all the musical 
information that forms the basis of the audio file is preserved when the file 
is compressed and stored on the computer. Lossless codecs provide the 
highest audio fidelity, but the files they create are relatively large, which 
means that you can fit fewer songs on a computer hard drive or music server.
On the other hand, the second category, lossy codecs, discard some part of 
the musical information to make the files smaller — for faster downloads on 
the Internet or to cram more music on a given size of computer storage 
device. These lossy codecs use sophisticated models of the human ear 
(and how it hears sounds) to throw away bits of musical information that 
are less important when you are listening to the music. You probably won’t 
notice the difference when listening casually, but many people (especially 
folks with good hearing!) can hear a difference when a lossy and lossless 
version of the same music are played back over a high-quality home theater 
audio system.

67
 Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music
The most common lossless codecs you’ll run across are as follows:
 
 Windows Media Lossless: Part of Microsoft Windows Media Player 9 
and 10, this codec is built into the Windows Media Player software and 
is supported by some of the media adapter systems we discuss in 
Chapter 10.
 
 Apple Lossless: Included with iTunes software, Apple’s Lossless 
Encoder is Apple’s competitor to Windows Media Lossless.
 
 Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC): Free Lossless Audio Codec is, as its 
name implies, a lossless codec that’s free. It’s part of an open-source 
initiative; you can find out more at http://flac.sourceforge.net. 
A few of the audio players we discuss in Chapter 10 are beginning to 
support the FLAC codec, including the Sonos Digital Music System and 
the Slim Devices Squeezebox.
Among the most popular lossy codecs are the following:
 
 MP3: MPEG-1 (Motion Picture Experts Group 1) Audio Layer 3 is the 
full name of the most common digital music format. MP3 audio files are 
the ones commonly traded (usually illegally) on the Net, and they are 
the most common digital music codec used on PCs and digital music 
systems in a wireless network.
 
 A limited number of systems and software applications also support the 
more advanced mp3PRO codec, which adds a technology called SBR 
(Spectral Band Replication) to improve the sound quality over standard 
MP3-encoded music files.
 
 WMA: Windows Media Audio is the standard audio format used by 
Windows Media Player and compatible hardware. A lossless version of 
WMA (discussed previously) does exist, but most WMA files use a lossy 
compression system.
 
 AAC: Advanced Audio Codec is the format used by Apple Computer’s 
popular iTunes Music Store and is the default codec for music encoded 
using the iTunes application. Like WMA, AAC files are lossy (though 
within Apple’s iTunes system there is a lossless codec as well, called 
Apple Lossless).
 
 Ogg Vorbis: Another free codec is Ogg Vorbis (www.vorbis.com). Ogg 
Vorbis is designed to be free from the licensing fees that software and 
hardware companies must pay for other codecs such as MP3, and also 
provides improved sound quality compared to other lossy codecs.

68
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Your choice of codec will depend on several things:
 
 Where you get your music: If you buy digital music at an online music 
store, you’re stuck with the codec it uses. Most stores use WMA or AAC 
and not MP3 because these formats allow the record companies to stick 
DRM (digital rights management) software into the music files, which 
keeps buyers from sharing this music on the Internet. If you create your 
own music from CDs at home, your choice will be influenced by the 
software you use.
 
 The devices you use to play your music in your home theater: As we 
discuss in Chapter 10, you can use a large number of devices (usually 
called media players or adapters) to get music from a computer into 
your home theater. Most of these devices support only a limited number 
of codecs, so you have to match the codec you use to create and store 
digital music with those supported by your media player.
 
 Personal preference: Many folks simply find that they prefer a lossless 
codec or a codec such as AAC (which is newer and takes advantage of 
advances in codec technology) to MP3. We recommend that you figure 
out the first two criteria, and then try out a few different codecs and see 
whether you can tell a difference.
 
We talk in great detail about the sources for digital music and also about the 
devices that you can use to integrate this music into your home theater in 
Chapter 10. The Media Center PCs we discuss in Chapter 9 are also a great 
way to get digital audio into your home theater.
Getting your hands on MP3s
We bet you’ve heard a lot about MP3 music, but where do all these MP3s 
come from, anyway? Is there an MP3 fairy out there who magically dumps 
them on the hard drives of good girls and boys?
Well, in fact, there used to be something pretty similar. Napster (which is 
now gone, due to legal actions) and other file-sharing services allowed people 
to put their music collections online and share them with the world. Of 
course, record companies weren’t all that supportive of this grassroots 
music revolution, so most of these services soon got sued out of existence.
Today, you can get your own MP3 files (and notice we call them files, because 
they’re just that — computer data files on a hard drive) in two legal ways:

 Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music
 
 Rip your own: You can convert your CDs to MP3s on your computer 
(this process is called ripping). To do this, you need a PC with a CD or 
DVD drive (which we bet you already have) and an MP3 program. Our 
favorite programs are MUSICMATCH Jukebox for Windows (www.
musicmatch.com) and iTunes for the Mac and Windows (www.apple.
com/itunes).
 
 Download legally: These days, it’s really easy to find legal places to 
download the most popular music on MP3 (or in AAC or WMA formats). 
Some of our favorite online music stores include Apple’s iTunes Music 
Store (available within Apple’s iTunes software or at www.apple.com/
itunes/) and Rhapsody (www.rhapsody.com). We talk about a bunch 
of these stores in Chapter 10.
Old-School Jams — Turntables
For most of the world, the LP has unfortunately gone the way of the dodo. 
But although LPs are far from the public eye, they’ve never really gone away. 
Many artists still release LP versions of their new records, and a handful of 
small manufacturers (and a few big ones) continue to crank out turntables.
In fact, the turntable has become hip again in some circles. And many audio-
philes have long felt that LPs (at least when played on super-high-quality 
turntables) sound better than CDs.
Buying a turntable isn’t as simple as buying a CD, a DVD-A, or an SACD 
player. It’s a much more subjective process. In the digital world, it’s easy to 
keep a checklist of features in mind, such as digital output or MP3 CD 
support. But when you start shopping for turntables, you’re getting into a 
whole different world. Some esoteric stuff is out there, such as vacuum 
hold-down systems (which suck the record flat on the platter to alleviate 
warps), as well as what we call “religious wars” between proponents of 
different turntable design philosophies. Having said that, here are a few 
things to consider when buying a turntable:
 
 Belt drive or direct drive: The platter (the thing that the record sits 
and spins around on) can be spun in two ways. There are pros and cons 
for each.
 
• Belt drive: In this setup, the motor is separated from the platter 
and spindle and turned by a rubber belt that runs around the 
outside of the platter. A belt drive tends to isolate the rest of the 
turntable from any vibrations coming from the motor (vibrations 
that the stylus or needle could pick up and transmit to the receiver 
and to your ears). On the downside, a belt drive tends to be less 
accurate than a direct drive in its playback speed, which can lead 
to changes in the pitch of your music.

70
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
• Direct drive: An electric motor is directly attached to the spindle 
(the small cylinder that the platter rests upon). Direct drive 
turntables tend to be a bit more constant in their speed, so the 
turntable is more likely to turn 331/3 times per minute without any 
speed variations (such variations tend to make your music sound 
warbly). Some folks, however, feel that direct drive turntables are 
more susceptible to vibrations (both external, such as footsteps, 
and internal, such as the vibrations of the motor itself).
 
 Suspended or unsuspended: Vibrations are a big deal with a turntable 
because the stylus dragging through the grooves of the LP can pick up 
extraneous vibrations (such as those caused by your four-year-old 
daughter doing a particularly bouncy dance while listening to music) 
and transmit them along with your music. Some turntables have 
elaborate suspension systems designed to isolate the platter (and 
therefore the record) from these vibrations, whereas others rely on the 
user to isolate the entire turntable (by placing the whole thing on a very 
sturdy rack, for example).
 
 Automatic, semiautomatic, or manual: An automatic turntable lets you 
put a record on the platter, push a button, and listen. The turntable 
itself moves the tone arm over the record, drops it down before the first 
song, and then lifts it up and returns it to the resting position when the 
side of the record is finished. High-end audiophiles hate these because 
they — well, we don’t know why they hate them so much, though we 
guess they just love to drop that needle down. Manual turntables 
require you to manually move the tone arm over the record and then 
lower it onto and off the record. Semiautomatics do half your work for 
you — you lower the stylus onto the record, but when the record side is 
finished playing, the turntable lifts the tone arm and stylus up off the 
record automatically so you don’t have to hear that repeating fpppt fpppt 
fpppt sound as the stylus does an endless loop at the end of the record.
In our opinion, good turntables can have any of the attributes we just 
mentioned. We’ve heard good automatic turntables and good manuals, good 
belt drives and good direct drives, and so on. If you’re buying a turntable, 
think about your needs. Do you have a lot of records that you’re going to 
play all the time? If so, invest $500 to $1,000 dollars in a nice turntable from a 
company such as Rega (www.rega.co.uk) or Pro-Ject (www.project-
audio.com). Have just a couple of old favorites you can’t get on CD? Check 
out some of the $150 to $200 models from Sony or Denon. Want to be a DJ 
(and do some scratching like the late, great Jam Master Jay)? Check out 
Panasonic’s Technics brand of DJ turntables.
Whatever you do, don’t leave a turntable out of the equation if you have a 
few boxes of records in the closet.

71
 Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music
 
Because LPs are much less popular than they used to be, many new A/V 
receivers don’t have the proper inputs to connect a turntable. So before you 
plunk down some cash on a new turntable, check to see whether your receiver 
even has a turntable connection (usually labeled “phono”). If it doesn’t, you 
can use an external phono preamp, which connects between the turntable and 
the receiver. You simply plug the cables from the turntable in to the phono 
Catching up with cassettes
If you need a cassette deck because you have 
a ton of tapes filling shoeboxes in your closet, or 
because you want to make tapes for playing 
back in the car or in a portable headset, here 
are a few things you should look for:
  Single or dual well: If you think you might 
end up dubbing (or making copies of) a lot 
of cassettes, you need a dual-well tape 
deck that has this capability. If you plan to 
record only the radio or your own CDs, you 
can save money by getting yourself a 
single-well deck.
  Noise reduction: Before Dolby Labs became 
famous for its surround-sound standards 
(such as Dolby Digital), millions of audio-
philes knew the company for its Cassette 
Noise Reduction standards. These 
standards (which go by the names Dolby B, 
C, and S) are electronic processes designed 
to increase the sound quality of cassettes 
by decreasing noise (such as tape hiss — 
the sound you can hear when quiet pas-
sages are playing). The general rule for 
these systems is that the higher the name of 
the system, alphabetically, the better (so S 
is best, then C, then B). The key thing to 
keep in mind is that, for the best sound qual-
ity, you need to play tapes back on a deck 
that supports the system with which the 
tape was recorded. If you record with Dolby 
C, you need to play your tape on a Dolby C 
deck. Dolby S is a slight exception to this 
rule; tapes recorded with this system can 
be played back on Dolby B decks with some 
of the benefits of S intact.
  Number of heads: Most tape decks have 
two heads (the heads are the electromag-
netic devices that read and write audio 
signals onto the tape itself). The two-head 
design uses the same head for both playing 
back recorded music and for recording 
music on the tape (the other head is used 
for erasing the tape when you are record-
ing). Fancier tape decks have a three-head 
design, which has separate playback and 
record heads. Because each head is used 
for only one function, each head can be 
designed for optimal functionality for its 
purpose.
  Number of motors: A tape is moved over the 
heads by means of a pair of spindles (which 
fit in the little wheels on the cassette) 
and — more importantly — by a pair of 
devices called a capstan and a pinch roller. 
The capstan and pinch roller are the essen-
tial devices that keep the tape moving over 
the heads at the correct speed, without any 
speed fluctuations. Inexpensive tape decks 
use a single electric motor and a belt (like a 
radiator fan belt in a car) for this function, 
while higher-quality decks have a motor 
for each of the spindles and a third for the 
capstan/pinch roller combo.

72
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
preamp and then use a standard audio cable to connect the preamp to any 
open audio inputs on the receiver (most people use the ones labeled “aux”). 
Recoton (www.recoton.com) makes an inexpensive phono preamp for about 
$50, but you can buy more expensive (and better) preamps from some of the 
turntable manufacturers that we mention in this section. You can also 
build your own phono preamp from kits available online at places like www.
bottlehead.com.
Tuning In to Radio
Sometimes, you just can’t be bothered to put in a CD or an SACD or cue 
up an MP3 (not to mention pull out, clean off, and play a record). You know 
that couch potato lethargy we’re talking about? If you’re a music lover 
(and we bet you are), nothing allows you to enjoy music with absolutely no 
involvement like turning on your favorite radio station and vegging out.
Local radio
When putting together a home theater, you don’t usually have to think about 
much when it comes to radio. Unless you’re buying separate components, a 
radio tuner is built into your A/V receiver.
If you do buy separate components instead of an A/V receiver (sneak over 
to Chapter 10 if you don’t know what we’re talking about), you probably 
will have to buy a radio tuner and plug it in to your system as an audio 
source device, just as you plug a CD or DVD-audio player in to your system. 
AM/FM radio tuners usually cost about $150 to $500 (though, like any A/V 
component, you can buy high-end versions that cost ten times the average). 
Things to look for include the following:
 
 AM and FM sensitivity: Measured in the oh-so-familiar decibel femto-
watt (dBf), this is a measurement of how well the tuner can pick up sig-
nals. The lower this number (it’s usually in the range of 9 to 11 dBf), the 
better.
 
 Adjustable selectivity: Some tuners come with a switch on the front (or 
on the remote control) that lets you choose between wide and narrow 
selectivity. The wide mode gives you better reception and sound quality 
on powerful stations, whereas the narrow mode can tune in weak 
signals from distant stations while avoiding interference from stations 
on adjacent frequencies.

73
 Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music
 
 Antenna diversity: Not a necessity, but some fancier tuners have two 
antenna inputs. You can manually or automatically have the tuner 
choose between the inputs when you’re trying to pull in a radio station.
If you’re lucky enough to live in an area with some good radio stations, you 
might want to invest in a high-quality tuner near the top of your price range.
Satellite radio
If you’re like us, you live where there isn’t a whole lot of programming you 
want to listen to. In that case, you might check out satellite radio, which 
offers a huge number of stations (each of the two satellite radio providers 
offer more than 100 channels) beamed to your house or car from a handful of 
geostationary satellites hovering above the equator. We find there’s a ton 
more diversity and just plain interesting stuff coming across these space-
based airwaves than we find on our local radio. Satellite radio services from 
XM Radio and Sirius require you to — gasp — pay for your radio (both start 
at $12.95 a month).
If you want to get into satellite radio, you need to first check out the Web 
sites of the two providers, www.xmradio.com and www.sirius.com, to 
see which one has the programming that you prefer. Then you need to get 
your hands on a satellite radio tuner (you can find a bunch of models listed 
on each company’s Web page). The majority of these satellite tuners are 
designed for in-car use (because people tend to listen to the radio most often 
while they’re driving), but you can find radios suitable for in-home (and 
home theater!) use from both providers.
If you want to put satellite radio into your home theater, you have a few 
choices:
 
 You can get a dockable tuner. You can put these tuners in your car and, 
when you get home, pull them out and plug them in to your A/V receiver 
via a simple docking station that provides power, an antenna connec-
tion, and the proper connectors to hook in to your receiver. This is 
usually the cheapest and most convenient approach if you’re going to be 
in the car a lot but still want satellite radio in the house.
 
 You can buy a dedicated in-home satellite tuner that looks like any other 
piece of A/V gear and sits on your equipment rack along with your 
receiver and DVD player. These models (such as Polk Audio’s XRt12 
Reference Tuner — $299.99 list price, www.polkaudio.com) have 
bigger displays and higher-quality internal components for the best 
sound quality, but they aren’t portable like dockable radios.

74
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 You can buy an A/V receiver with a built-in or add-on satellite receiver. 
A growing number of A/V receivers (see Chapter 11 for the lowdown on 
these devices) have a built-in satellite receiver. Just add an antenna kit 
and a subscription and you’re off to the races (or listening to Howard 
Stern if it’s a Sirius radio!). A good example here is Denon’s AVR-1708 
(www.denon.com, $499.99), which includes a built-in XM radio receiver. 
You just need to add an inexpensive antenna kit. (This receiver even has 
an option for an iPod dock — it does it all!)
If you’re using a dedicated indoor satellite tuner (or one inside your receiver) 
and you also want to listen to satellite radio in your car, you’ll end up 
needing more than one subscription. Each tuner requires its own subscrip-
tion. Luckily, the second subscription can be part of a package deal and will 
run you $6.99 per additional radio on either service.
 
These satellites are down by the equator, so no matter where you live in the 
United States, you need to be able to put the antenna in a south-facing window 
to pick up a good signal in your home.
A digital alternative to satellite: HD radio
Although satellite radio has a lot of fans, many folks have shied away from 
paying $13 a month just to listen to the radio. The traditional radio broad-
casters have begun broadcasting with their own digital system, called HD 
Radio (www.hdradio.com), which is designed to offer similar “digital qual-
ity” advantages as satellite but without the monthly fee.
 
HD Radio doesn’t have a fee, but it also doesn’t have the continent-wide cover-
age of satellite radio. So if you’re a road warrior who travels long distances by 
car, you might prefer satellite’s ability to stay tuned in to a station no matter 
where you go.
HD Radio is, essentially, a second broadcast signal that a radio station can 
use to send digital broadcasts alongside their existing analog ones. HD Radio 
can be used by both AM and FM stations — the FM variant, like FM analog 
radio, is the higher quality one, with sound that is claimed to approach that 
of CDs.
Because of its digital nature, HD Radio is capable of sending a lot of addi-
tional data alongside the audio signal that’s going out over the airwaves — so 
you can see more programming data (such as the name of the song and the 
artist) along with data streams such as traffic info and stock prices.

75
 Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music
To get HD Radio into your home theater, you simply need to choose a home 
theater receiver capable of receiving HD Radio, such as Yamaha’s RX-V863 
(www.yamaha.com) or use a separate HD Radio receiver as an audio compo-
nent connected to your existing home theater receiver. The HD Radio Web 
site has a listing of HD Radio-capable devices, as well as a station listing, so 
you can find out what HD Radio offers in your area.
 
We think that the coolest feature of HD Radio is the iTunes Tagging feature 
(http://www.hdradio.com/iTunes_Tagging/). If you hear a song that 
you like on HD Radio, some HD Radio receivers (those with iPod docks 
included) let you press a button (labeled — no surprise — “tag”). When you 
do this, the song title, the artist, and other information are saved to a playlist 
that is transferred to your iPod the next time you dock it. When you then 
connect your iPod to your computer for synchronization, those tagged songs 
appear with links to the iTunes Store for purchase. Pretty neat.
Internet radio
 
If you set up a home theater PC in your A/V system, you can get lots of great 
radio programming from Internet radio broadcasts. Using an MP3 player, such 
as Musicmatch Jukebox or iTunes, or a streaming media player, such as 
Windows Media Player or Real Player (www.real.com), you can tune in to 
literally thousands of radio stations from around the world. With a broadband 
DSL or cable modem Internet connection, the quality is pretty decent, too.
So if you’re like Pat, and you find that San Diego is just out of range of the 
great PBS station in Santa Monica (www.kcrw.org), you can just tune in on 
the Net. Pretty cool, and it doesn’t cost you an extra penny. This is also a 
great way to get the radio broadcasts of your favorite college sports teams. 
Neither of us ever misses a Duke basketball game, even if we’re on the road, 
because we can tune in on our laptops. Go Blue Devils!
In Chapter 10, we tell you about media players and adapters that can 
support Internet radio. You can also use a Media Center PC, as described in 
Chapter 9.

Feeding Video into Your Theater
In This Chapter
 Digitizing your video experience with DVD
 Being old school with VCRs
 Personalizing your TV with a PVR
 Incorporating video extras into your home theater
I
f you’re like us, watching movies is the main reason you decided to get 
a home theater in the first place. High-quality music reproduction and 
high-impact video gaming are just (awesome) side benefits. You can get 
movies (and TV shows and other video content) into your home theater 
system in many ways — such as plugging in to a cable or satellite TV system 
or even hooking up an antenna for broadcast TV. (We talk about all of these 
TV systems in Chapter 7.) For most folks, however, watching a movie means 
watching a prerecorded movie (typically a movie on DVD that you’ve bought 
or you’ve rented from the local video store or online through a service such 
as Netflix).
In this chapter, we talk about the key sources of prerecorded video in your 
home theater. We spend most of our time discussing the source that’s most 
important to us and likely to you as well — the digital video disc, better 
known as the DVD. (They’re also sometimes called Digital Versatile Discs 
because they don’t just carry video.) But DVDs are not a high-definition 
format. So, now that we’re well into the age of the HDTV, we’re going to talk a 
fair amount about a disc format that many folks in the industry hope will 
replace the DVD: the high-definition Blu-ray disc. We finish the chapter with 
that old standby, the VCR, its replacement, the personal video recorder (or 
PVR), and some other nonbroadcast sources of video.
 
In Chapter 9, we talk about how PCs and Macs can take over the role of a DVD 
or Blu-ray disc player in your home theater, and in Chapter 10, we describe 
specialized, Internet-connected devices that can do the same thing. These 
days it’s all about the convergence between consumer electronics and PCs 
and the Internet. We tell you how to make these previously separate realms 
come together (and why you’d want to do so) in Chapters 9 and 10.

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
DVD (Still) Rules the Roost
The DVD is a high-quality centerpiece to a home theater. Keep in mind the 
cardinal rule of any A/V system: Garbage in equals garbage out. The corollary 
states that no matter how good your video display and audio system are, if 
you put a junky, low-fidelity signal into them, you’re going to see and hear 
junky, low-fidelity home theater. That’s why DVD is so important — it’s an 
inexpensive, easy-to-use, high-quality system for movies and movie sound-
tracks. And the better your display (such as an HDTV), the more you’ll 
appreciate a high-quality signal being fed to your display.
In this section, we spend a little time talking about the DVDs themselves 
and what they can do. Chances are good that you are already familiar 
with the DVD (after all, DVD has been one of the most — if not the most — 
rapidly adopted new technologies of all time). But DVD is a moving target — 
manufacturers of DVD players have continually improved their gear and 
added new features that both improve picture quality and make your 
DVD viewing more convenient. So read on and be prepared to discover 
something new!
Getting to know DVDs
The DVD is a 12cm optical disc (by the way, optical means that the data on 
the disc is read by a laser). From a distance, a DVD looks just like a CD. The 
big difference between the DVD and the CD is the format that each uses for 
burning those little digital pits into the disc (pits that turn into digital 1s and 
0s when the laser reads them). Because the DVD uses a more complex for-
matting scheme, it has the capacity to store a lot more data than a CD. A DVD 
can hold a minimum of 4.7GB of data (dual-layer DVDs, discussed later, can 
hold more), whereas a CD’s limit is about 700MB. So a DVD can hold more 
than six times as much data as a CD.
A DVD’s extra capacity is crucial to home theater because it lets the DVD 
store about two hours of high-quality digital video and digital audio signals 
using Dolby Digital or DTS (see Chapter 3 if you don’t know what these are) 
and an analog two-channel stereo signal as well. A CD, well, it can’t hold more 
than a few dozen minutes of this kind of home theater data.
 
You’ll also hear, as you begin getting deeper into the home theater world, 
about dual-layer and double-sided DVDs. These discs (which work just fine in 
any DVD player) hold even more data for long movies and cool extras, such as 
deleted scenes or director commentary. The additional space is made possi-
ble by putting the extra data on — no surprise here — a different layer of the 
DVD or on the other side (so you just have to flip the disc, like an LP).

79
 Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater
Like a CD, the DVD stores its information in a digital format (you probably 
guessed that from the name) and, for video, uses the MPEG format that we 
discuss in Chapter 4. The DVD can also hold the audio soundtracks that 
correspond to this video in a variety of Dolby and DTS formats, as well as 
store cool extra features, such as additional foreign language soundtracks, 
subtitles, and scene indexes (which let you skip to different scenes in a 
movie, just like you can skip to different songs on a CD).
The DVD can also do something that most other home theater source devices 
(we talk about a few others later in this chapter) can’t do. It can display true 
widescreen video.
 
Not all DVDs (the discs themselves, not the DVD player) give you a true wide-
screen anamorphic picture. Many DVDs have been formatted in the standard 
4:3 aspect ratio instead. If you want widescreen, you need to choose DVDs 
with labels that say “anamorphic,” “widescreen,” “16:9,” or something similar. 
Many movie companies put both versions on a single disc (using the dual-
layer technology we just mentioned) or release both widescreen and Pan and 
Scan (frames cropped to fit a traditional television screen) DVD versions of an 
individual movie. See Chapter 4 for all the details about widescreen viewing, 
including a handy explanation of the term anamorphic.
Choosing a DVD player
Well, we’ve talked a lot about why we think DVD players are so important in a 
home theater. Now comes the fun part — choosing one. There’s some really 
good news here, especially if your budget is like ours (and most people’s), 
which is to say, limited.
DVD technology has advanced incredibly in the few years that DVD players 
have been on the market, and the price drops have been stupendous. For 
example, Pat’s then-not-quite two-year-old somehow laid an impressive 
beating on his old DVD player. No worries though! He was able to buy a sweet 
new upconverting (we’ll explain this in a moment) HDMI-equipped player for 
about half of what he had paid for the previous DVD player. (So thanks, 
Annabel, for letting Daddy get a new DVD player! Now go beat up the new one 
so he can upgrade to Blu-ray.) Bottom line is this: If you’re still sitting on the 
DVD fence, get off it!
Like every single piece of A/V gear we discuss in this book, you can spend 
a fortune on a DVD player if you want to. And you may want to if you’re 
building a really fancy, no-holds-barred, high-end home theater. Although 
you can get a great picture from that $59 model, if you have a high-end video 
projector and a top-of-the-line surround-sound audio system, you might want 
to buy a fancier model. Such a system yearns for higher-quality electronic 

80
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
components and more powerful chips to convert the digital data on the 
DVD into video and sound. Just to give you an idea of the range of prices, 
as we write, the current prices of a single company (Denon) range from 
$150 to $3,500.
So what should you look for in a DVD player? We think the following items 
are the key things to put on your mental checklist as you start shopping:
 
 Connections on the back: We talk in detail about the hierarchy of 
connections in Chapter 16. At a minimum, you’ll want a DVD player 
featuring a component video connection, and just about all DVD players 
these days have this (as do almost all displays these days — and all 
HDTV-capable TVs will). If you have a TV that can accept these connec-
tions, make sure you get a DVD player that can also use them. On the 
audio side of things, you’ll find two kinds of digital connectors (for 
Dolby Digital and DTS digital surround sound) — the coaxial and 
optical (or Toslink) connections. The key thing here is to make sure 
that the connectors on your DVD player match up with those on your 
A/V receiver.
  
 Most new DVD players have moved on to digital video outputs. If your 
display supports an HDMI connection, consider a DVD player that has 
one of these outputs — read the section titled “Playing DVDs on an 
HDTV” for more details.
 
 Single or multidisc capability: DVD players come in single-disc and 
multidisc models. For just watching movies, a single-disc player is fine, 
but if you plan to use your DVD player as your only CD player, you might 
want to pay a bit more for a multidisc player that lets you provide hours 
of background music during, for example, a party.
 
 Progressive or interlaced: Progressive scan is becoming a big deal 
because the video industry is gradually moving from interlaced video 
toward a progressive video future. We discuss progressive and inter-
laced scans in more detail in Chapter 4, so we don’t bother you with 
that here. Bottom line: If you have an HDTV or other progressive-scan 
monitor, you want a DVD player that offers progressive-scan capabili-
ties. Although most progressive-scan TVs have a built-in deinterlacer for 
playing interlaced material (DVDs are still interlaced), the deinterlacers 
in many progressive-scan DVD players are better. Even if you don’t have 
a progressive-scan display but might someday, consider a progressive-
scan DVD player as well, especially considering that prices on these DVD 
players have dropped so much that they’re hardly more expensive than 
a regular DVD player — in fact, all but the cheapest DVD players these 
days have progressive-scan functionality.

81
 Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater
 
 Upconversion: The latest and greatest feature found in many new DVD 
players is the ability to upconvert a DVD to a higher resolution for play-
back on your HDTV display. An upconverting DVD player has an internal 
scaler (see Chapter 13 for more on this device’s functionality) that 
allows it to take the 480i resolution stored on DVDs and convert it to 
480p (progressive scan) or, more significantly, to a 720p, 1080i, or even 
1080p signal. Essentially, an upconverting DVD player gives you a 
simulated high-definition version of the video on your DVD. Just as 
important, an upconverting DVD player uses the HDMI outputs we 
discussed previously to send this picture to your HDTV display — so 
you get all the benefits of a digital connection and a picture that’s 
designed for a high-definition display.
 
 Support for other formats: Many DVD players now support online video 
file formats such as DivX or xvid. This can come in handy if you are 
downloading HDTV video clips from the Internet using these formats — 
you can burn DVDs on your computer and play them back on your DVD 
player.
 
 Adjustability: To get the best out of a home theater, you need to do 
more than just plug everything in properly. You also need to spend 
some time tweaking the audio and video settings to get the best picture 
in your room. Most of these adjustments are done on the TV or projec-
tor itself, not on the DVD player. But some DVD players allow you to 
adjust things such as brightness (or black level) in the DVD player.
 
 Surround-sound decoder: If you’re starting your home theater from 
scratch, we recommend that you buy a home theater receiver (or 
separate components decoder) that is capable of decoding (at a mini-
mum) Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Digital surround-sound signals. If, 
however, you are adding a DVD player to an existing home theater with 
an older receiver that doesn’t support digital surround sound, you can 
buy a DVD player with a built-in surround-sound decoder. The downside 
of this is that you need to use six analog audio cables to connect the 
DVD player to your receiver, instead of a single digital interconnect. 
Some of the older receivers were marketed as “Digital ready” with six 
preamp jacks on the back for just this purpose; if your receiver doesn’t 
have a built-in Dolby Digital decoder and it doesn’t have these six 
inputs (or its own Dolby Digital decoder), you can’t play back digital 
5.1-channel surround sound with it!
 
 Audio disc support: All DVD players can play back store-bought, 
prerecorded CDs. Not all, however, can play back homemade CD-R or 
CD-RW discs, nor can many DVD players play back CDs containing MP3 
music files. If these features are important to you (and you don’t have a 
CD player that can handle this for you), make sure your DVD player can 
handle all these formats before you buy.

 Recording capability: Just as the CD has moved from a factory-
produced, read-only CD to a “make your own” medium (such 
as CD-Rs and CD-RWs), so has DVD recording started to become a 
truly consumer-friendly technology.
 
 Remote control: Most people have too many remote controls when they 
get into home theater. To avoid remote overload, look at how other sys-
tems in your home theater can control your DVD player. For example, 
many A/V equipment vendors have special system link cables that let the 
receiver control the DVD player and other components. The downside of 
such systems is that you must buy all your equipment from the same 
vendor to take advantage of them. The alternative (which we discuss in 
Chapter 15) is to use a universal remote control to control everything. If 
you’re going down this route, ask your dealer if you need to consider 
special codes or other things before buying a specific DVD player.
 
 The folks behind the HDMI audio/video connection system have 
developed a standardized multicomponent control system, called CEC 
(Consumer Electronics Control) that will eventually work like the 
manufacturer-specific system link control systems — but across all 
manufacturers. As we write today, CEC is not yet widely adopted, but it 
is on the product development roadmap of many manufacturers and we 
expect to see it soon. If you see this feature, it’s worth considering.
 
 DVD extras: Many DVDs include extra features that you’d never get on a 
VHS tape, laserdisc, or other (older) video source. For example, some 
DVDs have alternate camera angles — so you can click a button on the 
remote control and see the film from a different character’s perspective. 
Most DVD players support this feature. You can also find DVD players 
that have special features, such as a digital zoom that lets you enlarge 
part of the picture on your screen, or a frame-by-frame fast forward, so 
that you can watch that starship explode in excruciating detail. You can 
even buy DVD players that can display standard PC or Mac JPEG picture 
files from Kodak’s PictureCDs or from your own homemade CD-R.
 
 All-in-one functionality: The DVD players with built-in surround-sound 
decoding are a first step in this direction, but if space is limited in your 
home theater, you may want to take the full leap — DVD players and A/V 
receivers in an all-in-one slim chassis. Lots of these models are part of 
lower-priced home-theater-in-a-box systems, but you can also find high 
quality (and expensive) all-in-ones. For example, the Scottish high-end 
A/V manufacturer Linn (www.linn.co.uk) has a cool all-in-one system 
called the Classik Movie System.
 
If you’re buying an inexpensive DVD player, it’s probably okay to choose one 
based on features and reviews (we list a bunch of places to find these reviews 
in Chapter 23). But if you plan to spend $400 or more on a DVD player and are 
lucky enough to have a good home theater shop or dealer nearby, take the 
time to get a good audition of the DVD player. Do this in the showroom of the 
dealer, at a minimum, and at home with a demo model, if possible. You’re the 
one who’s going to be watching movies on this machine, so make sure your 
eyes like what they see.

 Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater
Playing DVDs on an HDTV
 
Many folks hear “widescreen” and “digital” and think “HDTV.” Well, DVD is 
not HDTV. DVD is digital. It provides a great picture, but it isn’t a true high-
definition video source. Although DVD looks better than ever before when you 
play it back on an HDTV (using a progressive-scan DVD player we mention 
earlier in this chapter), DVD doesn’t give you the same quality of picture that 
a full-on HDTV signal (coming in over a broadcast TV signal or from your cable 
or satellite provider) can give.
Why don’t traditional DVDs “do” HDTV? Well, for one reason, HDTV wasn’t 
fully finalized and on the market when the DVD was developed, so DVD was 
designed to work with the TVs of the time (which are still the majority of TVs 
today). More importantly, HDTV requires a ton (literally, we measured) of 
digital data. Using the traditional NTSC signal, you can fit a two-hour movie 
comfortably onto a DVD, but you wouldn’t be able to fit more than a fraction 
of that movie onto a DVD if it was encoded as an HDTV signal.
What’s the region thing all about?
Region codes, which you may see in catalogs or 
on DVDs themselves, enable movie studios to 
control who can watch DVDs (the studios are 
like that about a lot of things). The codes are 
embedded in the DVD itself and also coded into 
the circuitry of the DVD player primarily so that 
movie studios can release movies and DVDs at 
different times in different places. So a movie 
may be released theatrically in the United 
States first, and then, several months later, it is 
released theatrically in Europe and also 
released on DVD in North America. The region 
code prevents North American retailers from 
selling the DVD to European customers while 
the movie is still in theaters there.
If you dig around on the Internet, you can find 
region-free programs for the PC or modified, 
universal, region-free DVD players. We’re gen-
erally supportive of this concept (especially 
when we find that some foreign movie we really 
want on DVD isn’t available in our North 
American region code), but we’re going to leave 
you to your own devices when it comes to 
region-free players. The movie studios are 
really down on this concept, and often aggres-
sively pursue legal actions (including jail time) 
against people who try to crack the region 
codes. In fact, we’re not going to say any more 
on the subject — jailhouse uniforms don’t fit our 
sense of fashion and style.
By the way, here are the regions:
  Region 1: North America
  Region 2: Western Europe, Middle East, 
Japan, and South Africa
  Region 3: South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
and Southeast Asia
  Region 4: Australia, New Zealand, and Latin 
America
  Region 5: Eastern Europe, Africa, and India
  Region 6: China
  Region 7: Reserved (For the moon maybe? 
We’re not too sure.)
  Region 8: Special international venues 
(such as cruise ships and airplanes)

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Upconverting DVD players give you something approaching HDTV, but the 
video being fed from these players into your display is not true HDTV. To get 
true HDTV, manufacturers have to go beyond the traditional DVD — and the 
next section spells out the path that movie studios and the consumer elec-
tronics industry are taking to bring disc-based HDTV movies to the masses.
 
Until you’re ready to invest in a Blu-ray disc player (as we write, the cheapest 
players are around $300 — about four times as expensive as a good upcon-
verting DVD player), you can get a good, widescreen experience with an 
upconverting DVD player using an HDMI connection to your HDTV. But to get 
the most out of your HDTV, we highly recommend that you consider Blu-ray.
Bringing High-Def to Discs: 
The Blu-ray Disc
The consumer electronics industry has been through a wrenching standards 
war over the past few years as it tried to come up with a high-definition 
replacement for the DVD. Disc player manufacturers and movie studios took 
sides by joining one or another of two groups with competing standards for 
the DVD replacement:
 
 Blu-ray: Sony led this group of studios and manufacturers — and forced 
the issue by making Blu-ray the standard in the PlayStation 3 game 
console.
 
 HD-DVD: This competing format was championed by Toshiba, and 
supported by a number of other studios and manufacturers.
For about two years these two formats fought it out in the marketplace, with 
each claiming technical superiority, lower prices, and greater movie studio 
support at various times. Finally, in January 2008, a major movie studio (Time 
Warner) announced that it would move its new HD movie titles from HD-DVD 
to Blu-ray. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back, and only a few 
weeks later Toshiba pulled the plug on HD-DVD, leaving Blu-ray disc as the 
sole high-def disc format.
That makes it easy for us to recommend that you consider purchasing a 
Blu-ray disc player for your high-definition home theater. (And you have no 
idea how happy it makes us to be able to finally make a recommendation — 
after two years of being asked and having to recommend that people wait for 
one format or another to win out!)

85
 Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater
Understanding Blu-ray
The Blu-ray disc, as mentioned, was developed by Sony. Blu-ray disc players 
are now manufactured by almost all major consumer electronics companies. 
Blu-ray is a very capable disc format — by which we mean that there will 
be lots of storage space on a Blu-ray disc. Storage space is the key for high-
definition disc formats simply because HDTV takes up as much as nine or ten 
times the storage space (for any given length of video) than does a standard-
definition DVD-quality video. So you really need to be able to cram a lot of 
bits on the disc to make high definition work.
The good news here is that Blu-ray can hold a lot of bits and bytes — up to 
50GB of data (more than five or six times what a standard DVD can hold). 
That 50GB capacity is for a dual-layer disc; a single-layer disc can hold 25GB 
of data — enough space for at least two hours of high-definition program-
ming. Blu-ray discs can hold even more data if the disc is encoded using a 
more efficient codec (such as MPEG-4 instead of MPEG-2), which means you 
can potentially fit four hours of high def on a single-layer disc.
Blu-ray discs support the same audio formats that a regular DVD supports 
but also include the latest and greatest from Dolby — Dolby Digital Plus and 
Dolby TrueHD. (See Chapter 5 for more on these formats.) Because very few 
A/V receivers include decoders for these new formats today, Blu-ray disc 
players have a built-in surround-sound decoder that lets you use these 
higher-resolution audio formats.
Go ahead — let the kids play with the disc
If you have younger kids (like Pat does), or even 
if your kids are old enough to know better (like 
Danny’s), you’ve probably experienced the infa-
mous scratched-DVD phenomenon. Kids love to 
play with shiny things, and their favorite DVD is 
usually high up on the “ooh, shiny” list. In Pat’s 
house, the Finding Nemo DVD has taken the 
worst of this abuse.
Well Blu-ray has a solution for you. Because 
the physical structure of a Blu-ray disc is even 
more susceptible to scratching than DVD, the 
Blu-ray folks decided up front to include a hard 
coating on each Blu-ray disc. Advanced poly-
mers cover the surface of a Blu-ray disc, so go 
ahead and let the two-year-old carry the disc to 
and from the player — she won’t make her 
favorite scene unwatchable due to scratches. 
Go science!

86
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
You can use a standard digital audio cable, however, for regular Dolby Digital 
or DTS, if your receiver doesn’t have an HDMI or a multichannel analog input.
 
Blu-ray gets its name from the color of the laser that reads the discs inside a 
Blu-ray player. Instead of the traditional red laser used by CDs and regular 
DVDs, Blu-ray uses a blue laser. (We bet you knew what we were going to say 
there, huh?) The blue laser has a smaller wavelength and is more suited to 
reading the physically smaller spots on the disc itself. This ability to focus in 
on smaller spots allows the disc to have more spots — and more spots means 
more data.
Combating Blu-ray FUD
Many new technologies face FUD (fear, uncer-
tainty, and doubt). So-called experts of all sorts 
crawl up out of the woodwork and raise objec-
tions to the new technology, making potential 
customers unsure about whether they should 
become adopters of that technology. Sometimes 
these objections are true (or based in truth but 
exaggerated); sometimes they’re not even close 
to being true. Regardless, they make it difficult 
for regular people to feel comfortable about 
buying a new system.
Well in the Blu-ray world, the protracted stan-
dards war led to a lot of FUD on both sides of the 
aisle. A few of the most common misconcep-
tions about Blu-ray discs and players follow:
  Blu-ray disc players won’t play CDs: This 
one is based on a bit of truth. The first few 
models of Blu-ray disc players didn’t have 
the right lasers and related mechanisms to 
play audio CDs. That’s a thing of the past, 
though, and all Blu-ray disc players we 
know of on the market today play audio CDs 
and regular DVDs, as well as (of course) 
Blu-ray discs.
  Blu-ray discs are too susceptible to damage: 
Another one based on an older truth. As we 
discuss in the sidebar titled “Go ahead — 
let the kids play with the disc,” the Blu-ray 
disc is more susceptible to damage than a 
standard DVD, because the data stored in 
the disc is physically closer to the surface 
of the disc (and therefore, more likely to be 
destroyed by a scratch). In response to this, 
you’ll find that all Blu-ray discs on the 
market today have a special hard coating 
that makes them more durable than 
regular DVDs.
  Your Blu-ray disc player will be obsolete 
soon: This one is based on the fact that new 
features are being added to Blu-ray over 
time — features that allow more extras on 
the disc and allow the Blu-ray disc player to 
connect to the Internet for more content. It 
is true that not all Blu-ray disc players on 
the market support (or will ever support) 
these features. But neither will these play-
ers be obsolete anytime soon — their pri-
mary job is to play high-definition movies, 
and nothing in current or future Blu-ray disc 
plans will keep a player you buy today from 
doing this.

87
 Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater
Choosing a Blu-ray disc player
Choosing a Blu-ray disc player is just like choosing any component (see our 
advice on buying a DVD player, in the previous section titled “Choosing a 
DVD player”). Because Blu-ray is the newest technology around, most of the 
advanced features you’d look for on a DVD player (such as HDMI outputs and 
upconversion for regular DVDs) will be available on every model, so you’re 
more likely to be shopping based upon more generic characteristics such as 
price, brand name, and aesthetics.
Having said that, there are a few things you can look for when you compare 
Blu-ray disc players:
 
 Video output formats: In Chapter 5 we talk about the various video 
formats in home theater (the main ones are 480i/p, 720p, and 1080i/p). 
The Blu-ray disc is the only disc-based source of the highest-resolution 
video format (1080p), and all Blu-ray disc players can send a 1080p 
signal to your HDTV via an HDMI cable. Many Blu-ray disc players are 
also capable (and this is the thing you should look for) of sending a 
specific kind of 1080p signal — 1080p24 — to HDTVs that can display 
this format. The 24 here refers to the frame rate of the video; most 
movies are filmed at 24 frames per second. If your TV and Blu-ray disc 
player both support 1080p24, you can get the best playback of movies 
using this format. Support for 1080p24 is worth seeking out when you 
shop for Blu-ray disc players even if your HDTV doesn’t support it — 
after all, you may upgrade HDTVs before you upgrade your Blu-ray disc 
player!
  
 To get a 1080p24 signal out of your Blu-ray disc player and in to your 
HDTV, the disc itself must be recorded with a 1080p24 signal — most 
movies are indeed encoded this way on Blu-ray discs.
 
 Surround-sound formats: In Chapter 3 we talk about Dolby TrueHD and 
DTS-HD Master Audio, the newest surround-sound formats that provide 
a superior surround-sound experience by offering higher-resolution audio 
(higher resolution, in this case, means that more digital data is used to 
store the recorded audio, so it sounds truer to life). We think it’s worth 
looking for players that can handle both formats (most can). Blu-ray disc 
players can deal with TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio in two ways:
 
• Internal decoding: With an internal decoder, a chip inside the 
Blu-ray player decodes the surround sound from TrueHD or 
Master Audio (as opposed to a chip inside your receiver doing the 
decoding, which is typical for regular DTS or Dolby Digital). The 
internally decoded surround sound is then sent to your receiver 
over analog audio cables or over HDMI in a PCM format.

88
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
• Bitstream output: A few Blu-ray disc players can send the TrueHD 
or Master Audio bitstream — the undecoded audio bits as recorded 
on the Blu-ray disc — to your receiver over an HDMI connection. 
This approach allows your receiver to decode TrueHD or Master 
Audio internally, yielding the highest possible sound quality.
 
 For the bitstream output to work, you’ll need an HDMI-equipped 
receiver with its own built-in TrueHD or Master Audio decoder, 
which is rare (as we write in mid 2008). But if you’re looking to 
future proof your Blu-ray disc player choice, you might want to 
choose a player that can support this bitstream output, even if 
your current receiver doesn’t support it.
 
 Player profiles: All Blu-ray disc players can play high-definition 1080p 
movies with great surround-sound performance. Some, however, can do 
additional stuff that has nothing to do with picture or sound quality. 
These additional features were, until recently, described as Blu-ray pro-
files (Profile 1, 1.1, 1.2, and so on). Luckily the folks in the Blu-ray indus-
try have dispensed with those ungainly names and call the features by 
regular English names. Specifically, some Blu-ray disc players support 
two feature sets:
 
• BonusView: BonusView is an enhanced menu and extras system 
for Blu-ray. BonusView includes secondary audio and video 
circuitry that lets you do things such as view a secondary video 
source in a picture-in-picture window, or hear a secondary audio 
source (such as a director’s voiceover) while you listen to the 
primary soundtrack. All players introduced after November 2007 
should have this feature — older models may not.
 
• BD-Live: BD-Live brings the Internet to your Blu-ray disc player. 
With BD-Live your Blu-ray disc player can access Internet sites 
related to the movie or video you’re watching. For example, BD-Live 
can be used to provide up-to-date supplementary content to a movie 
(such as previews and trailers, commentary, and other bonus con-
tent). BD-Live can even be used for truly interactive features such 
as online chat or content relevant to you directly (for example, 
a forthcoming Blu-ray disc of Sleeping Beauty will allow kids to 
superimpose their local weather conditions on the screen — so if 
it’s raining where they live, it’s raining at the castle).
 
 Startup times: A seemingly trivial characteristic that can end up driving 
you crazy is startup time — the amount of time between pressing the 
On button on your Blu-ray disc player and the movie starting to play 
on your HDTV screen. Keep in mind that Blu-ray disc players are compli-
cated bits of machinery (like a PC in many ways) and early models often 
took a minute or more to start playing a movie. Newer players can start 
in a matter of seconds — which saves your sanity. If a Blu-ray disc 
player has a good startup time, the manufacturer will probably advertise 
that fact, and reviews will mention it.

 Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater
VCRs Ain’t (Quite) Dead Yet
We spend a lot of time talking about DVD players because we love them so 
much. But we realize that some movies just aren’t available on DVD yet 
(or ever, in some cases). And you probably want to record TV shows or 
watch home movies you’ve recorded with your camcorder. Or, like Danny, 
you have a zillion VHS tapes that you’re stuck with in a DVD age. These are 
all areas in which a videocassette recorder (VCR) comes in super handy.
You can buy three kinds of VCRs today:
 
 VHS VCRs: These are your standard, garden-variety VCRs that have 
been around for 40 years or so. They use VHS videocassettes and record 
a low-resolution TV signal (only about 240 lines of resolution). Most 
of these VHS VCRs are cheap (less than $100), and most include 
stereo audio capabilities (if so, they’re labeled HiFi) and analog Dolby 
surround-sound capabilities.
 
 S-VHS VCRs: The S-VHS (or Super VHS) VCR uses a special S-VHS tape 
to provide a higher-quality, higher-resolution (400 lines, instead of 
240) picture. Regular VHS tapes work on these decks, but S-VHS video-
cassettes don’t work on most regular VHS decks. (If you plan on trading 
tapes with someone or using a regular VHS VCR you have elsewhere, 
keep that in mind.) S-VHS VCRs start at around $90.
 
 D-VHS VCRs: The latest and greatest in the VCR world, these are high-
definition VCRs. D-VHS VCRs can play and record standard VHS and 
S-VHS videotapes. More importantly, D-VHS VCRs can also record all 
HDTV formats (discussed in Chapter 5). You can get a limited number of 
movies on prerecorded D-VHS videocassettes, but it’s a small number 
compared to what you can get on DVD. You can buy a D-VHS VCR for 
about $500 — if you can find one.
Gaming your way into Blu-ray
Many (perhaps even most) Blu-ray disc players 
in homes around the world today are not dedi-
cated, standalone disc players. Instead, they’re 
found inside one of the most popular video 
game consoles out there — Sony’s PlayStation 
3. The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is Sony’s latest con-
sole with killer 3D graphics for games, a built-in 
Web browser, and support for playing music 
and photos on your HDTV screen. The PS3 also 
has a built-in, fully functional Blu-ray disc 
player. (Sony chose Blu-ray as the format for 
storing games in the PS3.)
The great thing about using the PS3 as your Blu-
ray disc player is that it doesn’t cost any more 
than a standalone Blu-ray disc player. (You can 
pick up a new PS3 starting at about $399, which 
is a typical price for a Blu-ray disc player.) So 
for the same price you get a great disc player 
and a fully functioning game console. We talk 
about the PS3 in depth in Chapter 8.

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 The D-VHS system has been out for more than seven years and has 
essentially been a major flop. These recorders work pretty well, with 
great picture quality, but folks are accustomed to the wonders of DVDs, 
with their almost instant access to any spot on the disc, their durability, 
and just the plain fact that you never need to rewind a tape (nothing 
worse than forgetting to rewind!). And PVRs (personal video recorders, 
discussed in the next section) have pretty much taken over the TV show 
“time shifting” role in most homes. So although one or two manufactur-
ers still make D-VHS recorders, they’re all but gone from the market. We 
suspect that Blu-ray will kill them off for good. We can’t recommend that 
you buy a D-VHS deck, but we won’t try to stop you — just be aware that 
there’s probably not a lot of future in these devices.
When buying a VCR of any kind, look for the following:
 
 Hi-Fi capability: All D-VHS and S-VHS VCRs and most regular VHS decks 
have this feature. If you buy a model without it, you won’t even get 
stereo sound — just crummy mono (one-channel) sound.
 
 VCR Plus+: This system enables the average human being to record a 
certain show at a certain time more easily. You simply punch in a 
special code listed in your paper’s TV listings (or in TV Guide) next to 
the show you want to record. More advanced versions of VCR Plus+ 
(called Silver and Gold) allow you to localize your VCR Plus+ settings for 
your area.
 
 All-in-one units: Some VCRs are incorporated into a single chassis with 
a DVD player or with a MiniDV or other camcorder tape player. These 
all-in-one units take up less room on your equipment rack. And the VCR/
camcorder tape combo units make it easy to make VCR copies of your 
home movies.
 
 Even if your VCR is in the same chassis as a DVD player, you can’t make 
tapes of your favorite DVD movies. A copy protection system called 
Macrovision keeps you from doing this, and it’s built in to all DVD 
players, all VCRs, and most commercial DVD discs. Even if you want to 
copy your favorite movie from DVD to VHS to play back on a VCR in 
your vacation home or somewhere else, you’re out of luck.
 
We’re not all that enthusiastic about the VCR these days (although we think 
the D-VHS would be pretty cool if many people weren’t restricted from using it 
for its intended purpose — recording HDTV shows for later playback). All big 
movie rental places such as Blockbuster have phased out VHS tapes in favor 
of DVDs and Blu-ray. But we do think it’s worthwhile to have an inexpensive 
VCR in your home theater, just to have the capability of playing older movies 
that you can’t find on DVD. We recommend you get an inexpensive S-VHS 
model — and don’t spend too much money on it.

I
n the previous two chapters, we talk about a bunch of different audio and 
video sources that let you enjoy prerecorded content (such as movies on 
DVD or music on CD) or content that you’ve created yourself (such as home 
movies and recordings you’ve made of broadcast TV). For most people, this kind 
of content is just part of the overall home theater experience. You may also want 
to use your cool A/V equipment to do standard couch potato stuff — watching 
the big game or sitcoms on TV. In this chapter, we discuss the different ways you 
can bring these “outside the house” sources into your home theater.
 
We talk about three primary ways you can get television into your home — satel-
lite, cable, and over-the-air broadcasts. We don’t think these three things need 
to be mutually exclusive. You might, for example, get a satellite TV system but 
also have an antenna to pick up local stations. Or you might get digital cable 
to pick up those mythical 500 stations but still hook up an antenna to pick up 
the local HDTV broadcasts. So keep an open mind as you plan your theater.
 
Many local phone companies are beginning to offer TV services, often using 
fiber-optic cables, which are replacing regular copper phone lines. In most cases 
these services don’t (currently) differ all that much from the services offered by 
cable TV providers — they connect to your TV the same way, use similar set-top 
boxes, and offer similar feature sets. In the future, however, these IPTV (Internet 
Protocol TV) services may offer a richer mix of channels — on demand — and 
more cool features than either satellite or cable. The biggest telephone company 
provider of TV services today is Verizon (with its FiOS fiber-optic deployments), 

92
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
and AT&T (formerly SBC) is right behind them with something called uVerse. 
Keep an eye out for your own phone company — pretty soon, we expect it’ll be 
competing directly with your cable and satellite TV services.
Digital Satellite Does It All
For many home theater enthusiasts, TV means one thing: satellite TV. DSS 
(Digital Satellite Service) is the way people do satellite today (many people 
also call it DBS, Direct Broadcast Satellite). If you wanted satellite TV twenty 
or so years ago, you were stuck with something called C-Band (named after 
the radio frequency on which these satellites operated), which required that 
you to put a huge (9-foot or so) satellite dish in your backyard.
DSS is a much more user- and landscape-friendly version of satellite TV. DSS 
dishes can be as small as 18 inches across and are much easier to integrate 
into the average backyard. Despite this more compact size, DSS has all the 
advantages that drew people to those big dishes back in the ’80s — tons of 
channels and interesting programming you can’t get from your local broad-
cast channels.
 
If your cable company offers a digital cable service (which we discuss in an 
upcoming section), you can probably get just as many channels on that ser-
vice as you can on a satellite service.
Signing up for digital satellite
In the United States, the two main providers of DSS services are DIRECTV and 
EchoStar (EchoStar’s service is called DISH Network), and they are pretty 
similar. Both services offer digital transmission of their video content using 
MPEG-2 (discussed in Chapter 4) — with an increasing amount of their pro-
gramming being moved to the even more efficient (more video in less band-
width) MPEG-4 system. This digital transmission has advantages for both the 
satellite companies (because it lets them fit more TV channels into the radio 
waves over which their satellites broadcast) and the customer (because it 
eliminates the distortions that often occur in nondigital transmissions).
Both of the major satellite TV providers, DIRECTV and DISH Network, have 
announced (just as we are going to print) that they will begin offering some of 
their HDTV (pay-per-view movie) programming in the Full HD 1080p format. 
This is big news, and we’ll be keeping our eyes on this as it happens. Check 
out www.directv.com and www.dishnetwork.com for more info, and 
we’ll give you our take on this service at www.digitaldummies.com as 
soon as we have a chance to test it out.

 Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
 
Both DSS service providers are furiously launching new satellites into orbit, 
outfitted with systems that support the newer MPEG-4 system, which provides 
greater compression (using about 40 percent fewer bits for the same quality 
of video). These new satellites are being used to offer more high-definition 
(HDTV) channels — both more nationwide channels (that everyone can get) 
and more local HDTV broadcasts.
 
To pick up stations coming from these new MPEG-4 satellites, you need a new 
satellite receiver that can decode MPEG-4. All current high-definition receiv-
ers available from DISH and DIRECTV are capable of this, but if you have a 
receiver that was made before 2005, you may need to replace your receiver 
with a newer model.
We like both services. To decide between the two, shop for pricing and the 
channels that are best for you. You can look at channel lineups and prices 
online at www.directv.com and www.dishnetwork.com.
 
As mentioned, the beauty of MPEG-4 is that it’s more efficient and can carry 
more channels of HDTV over the airwaves. This feature, along with the extra 
satellites launched over the past few years, means that DSS providers offer 
arguably the largest number of HDTV channels of any TV service provider.
Some of the key features of both DSS systems include
 
 Hundreds of channels, including movie, sports, and sometimes even 
local broadcast channels
 
 On-screen program guides that include all current and upcoming (for a 
week or so) programming scheduled on the system
 
 Dozens of digital audio channels
 
 High-definition TV
Understanding the drawbacks
DSS services are pretty awesome, we think, but they do have a few draw-
backs. If you decide to go the DSS route, keep a few things in mind:
 
 You might not get local stations. In some parts of the country, you can 
get a local package that includes most if not all local broadcast stations. 
In some smaller cities and more rural areas, you still need to get cable or 
set up a broadcast antenna to pick up local stations.
  
 You won’t get local stations in HDTV unless you’re lucky enough to be in 
one of the cities receiving the new MPEG-4 broadcasts discussed earlier 
in this section. Most HD-capable DSS satellite receivers have built-in, 
over-the-air, broadcast TV tuners that can pick up the HDTV signals 
being sent out by the TV stations in your town.

94
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 You need a special satellite receiver. You can’t just plug the cable from 
your satellite dish in to a TV; you need a special satellite receiver. You can 
share this receiver with other TVs in your house, but if you want to watch 
different programs on different TVs, you need a receiver for each TV.
 
 You need to hook into a phone line. Your satellite receiver has to “talk” 
back to the service provider to maintain your pay-per-view account and 
to check for software upgrades. The receivers usually do this in the 
middle of the night so they don’t interfere with phone calls. If you never 
use pay-per-view or some of the premium sports channels, you may be 
able to skip the phone line entirely. Check with the provider before you 
buy in on this if getting a phone line in your home theater is an issue.
 
 Your satellite dish antenna must be able to “see” the satellites. It must 
have a clear line of sight to the satellites, which hover over the equator. 
Some folks in northern areas (or in Hawaii) might not be able to pick up 
all the satellites, so they get only some of the channels. Even if you’re in 
the right spot, geographically speaking, you still need to have a clear view 
to the south, without hills and trees (or even tall buildings) in the way.
 
 You have to install the system. This isn’t a really big deal for most folks, 
particularly when free installation deals are constantly being adver-
tised. If you don’t own your home, however, installation could be a deal 
breaker, so check with your landlord first.
 
One more thing: You may run into some resistance from a homeowner’s asso-
ciation, neighborhood covenants, and the like. Don’t take this lying down. The 
FCC ruled in 2001 that these “local” regulations can’t be used to prevent you 
from installing a DSS dish. The only big exceptions are for safety (for example, 
you can’t be too close to a power line) and for homes in historic districts. You 
may also be restricted from attaching your dish to “common” areas such as 
shared exterior walls in condos. Otherwise, no one can keep you from using a 
dish if you want to. Know your rights! Check out www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/
otard.html for the long-winded text of this ruling.
Getting the dish on the dish
On your roof (or on the side of your house or on top of a big rock in your back-
yard or just about anywhere) goes an 18- to 30-inch round or oval satellite dish. 
This dish is your main link to those satellites floating around in space, so it 
has to be aimed properly to pick up the signals. (By the way, this aiming is the 
hardest part of the installation — despite the existence of self-install kits, we 
think aiming is sufficiently difficult that it warrants a professional installation.)
 
When you’re buying a DSS system for high-definition TV, make sure that you 
buy the corresponding HD-capable dish. These dishes are typically a bit 
bigger (about 24 inches) and are often oval. The HD dishes are capable of pick-
ing up more satellites (including the ones that carry local HD channels).

95
 Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
Within this dish assembly is a device called an LNB, or Low Noise Blocker — the 
horn-shaped dingus that sits in front of the parabola of the dish. This device sifts 
the high-frequency satellite signals out from other radio signals and blocks extra-
neous signals. Dishes can have one or more LNBs, depending on what you want 
to do with them. (Dishes with more than one LNB are referred to as dual-, triple-, 
or quadruple-LNB dishes — the newest DIRECTV dish, the AT9, has five LNBs.)
Deciding how many LNBs and antenna shape you want can be confusing. It 
depends on where you live, what service you are subscribing to, and how 
many TVs you want your satellite to feed into. There’s no simple formula 
because there are multiple variables (and we really hated that multiple vari-
able stuff back when we were in school).
 
One key factor to remember is that single-LNB dishes can feed only a single 
DSS receiver. If you want to watch different programs on different TVs simul-
taneously, you need at least a dual-LNB dish. We recommend that you get at 
least a dual-LNB dish; it’s a false economy to get the marginally cheaper single-
LNB dish.
If you subscribe to DIRECTV, you should consider the five-LNB dish if you 
want HDTV (or local channels in some parts of the country). DISH Network 
uses a second dish for HDTV, so you won’t ever run into a triple-LNB dish for 
that service.
Choosing a receiver
The television signals feeding in from a dish (or dishes) and through an LNB 
(or LNBs) are in a format that basically no TV can decode and display. So 
between the dish/LNB and your TV, you need to install a DSS receiver.
Regardless of which service you choose, you have a few decisions to make 
before you buy. Right at the top of the list, you’re going to need to work out 
whether or not you want a receiver that’s
 
 HDTV-capable: If you have an HDTV or an HDTV-ready monitor, you can 
get awesome high-definition programming through your DSS system. If 
you don’t have one of these HDTV-capable TVs, you gain nothing from 
an HDTV-capable DSS receiver. You may still want to buy one if a TV 
upgrade is in your near future, but if you don’t plan to upgrade for sev-
eral years, we suggest you wait. Receiver prices are always dropping, 
and you’ll probably get a much better deal in two years, even if you have 
to get rid of your existing receiver.

96
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 Home theater–capable: Any DSS receiver can be used in a home theater, 
but some of the cheaper receivers don’t have the proper chips inside 
or connectors on the back to provide the highest quality home theater 
experience that DSS can offer. We highly recommend that you make sure 
your DSS receiver has at least a component video connection on the 
back (we talk about video connectors in Chapter 16), as well as a digital 
audio connector (coaxial or optical) for Dolby Digital surround sound 
(which some, but not all, DSS programs include).
 
 PVR-equipped: Some DSS receivers now come with a built-in hard 
drive–based PVR (personal video recorder). Although you can certainly 
add your own PVR to a DSS-fed home theater, the integration of these 
units is kind of nice because the program guide that lets you select what 
show you want to watch live is well-integrated into the PVR’s recording 
scheduling system. See Chapter 6 for a discussion of PVRs.
You might also want to keep an eye out for more prosaic features when choos-
ing a DSS receiver. For example, some receivers have better (and easier to 
use) parental lockout controls that keep the kids from watching stuff you don’t 
want them to watch. Others have remote controls based on RF (radio frequen-
cies) instead of IR (infrared), so you can control them without a direct line of 
sight to the receiver. It always pays to check out the little details when you’re 
making these investments. (By the way, the investment isn’t too steep. You can 
find complete dish and two-receiver packages for free, but the price can rise 
to $200 or more for each HDTV-capable receiver, though you’re likely to get a 
rebate on the receiver price if you sign a long-term contract.)
Cable Cornucopia
The biggest competitor to the DSS companies comes from local cable com-
panies, such as Time Warner, Comcast, and Cox Communications. Until 
recently, most home theater buffs didn’t consider cable TV much of a com-
petitor to DSS — old-fashioned analog cable systems didn’t offer nearly as 
many channels (particularly when it came to movie channels) as the satel-
lites did. That fact has changed, however, with the advent of digital cable 
systems. These systems use MPEG-2 compression technology to carry analog 
(NTSC) programming into your house, and many provide you with Dolby 
Digital signals for at least some of the programming.
 
Lots of people confuse digital cable with HDTV, but for the majority of chan-
nels, digital cable is not HDTV. Most cable companies offer a dozen or so 
channels of HDTV over their digital cable systems (for example, Pat’s cable 
company offers him about 35 HDTV channels, out of about 500 total channels). 
But the rest is just digitally compressed and transmitted analog NTSC TV.

97
 Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
Functionally, DSS and digital cable are very similar. Both offer hundreds of 
channels, including tons of movie channels, pay-per-view movies, and every 
iteration of the Discovery channel you can imagine (Discovery Brain Surgery 
Channel, anyone?). Like DSS, digital cable includes a pretty onscreen inter-
face that lets you browse through TV listings, set reminder timers, and more.
The way that digital cable connects to your A/V system is even very similar 
to DSS. Digital cable requires a set-top box (equivalent to the DSS receiver) 
that converts these digitally compressed MPEG-2 channels into analog NTSC 
signals for your TV. And like DSS, if you want to get HDTV signals over digital 
cable (if your cable company offers them), you need a special set-top box 
with HDTV capabilities and HDTV connectors on the back, such as HDMI or 
wideband component video.
Can I see your CableCARD please?
Most new HDTVs are DCR, or digital cable–
ready. When you buy one of these TVs, you 
can plug the coaxial cable right from your wall 
into the TV, skipping the set-top box, at least for 
nonscrambled (encrypted) channels. A smaller 
number of HDTVs let you dispense with the 
set-top box for even those premium scrambled 
channels. To get these premium channels (such 
as HBO), you need to rent a device from your 
cable company known as a CableCARD, which 
plugs in to a CableCARD slot on your TV.
The CableCARD is a smartcard with an embed-
ded chip that can decrypt, or descramble, 
premium channels. Essentially, your cable com-
pany uses the CableCARD as a mini set-top box, 
built right into your TV.
As we write in 2008, only the 1.0 version of 
CableCARD is available. It’s limited in its capa-
bilities because it’s a one-way system. That 
means it can only descramble systems coming 
into your TV; it can’t communicate back with 
the cable company, in other words. So you lose 
the onscreen program guide, video-on-demand 
(VoD), and other features that a true set-top box 
gives you.
A 2.0 version of CableCARD has long been prom-
ised but never delivered by the cable industry. 
2.0 was supposed to offer two-way communi-
cations, providing all the fun program guide and 
VoD that 1.0 lacks. Unfortunately, CableCARD 
2.0 never appeared.
There’s good news to report, however. In early 
2008, a number of cable companies and con-
sumer electronics manufacturers (meaning, 
most importantly, TV manufacturers) announced 
support for a new system called Tru2way (www.
tru2way.com). When cable companies imple-
ment Tru2way (which they claim they’ll do by the 
end of 2008 or so) and when Tru2way is built 
in to TVs, the TVs will have the ability to finally 
dispense with the set-top box once and for all. 
Tru2way-enabled televisions (or other devices, 
such as PVRs) will be capable of downloading 
applications from the cable network and running 
them just like a set-top box can. We absolutely 
cannot wait for Tru2way to hit the market!

98
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
A number of HDTVs are available with the equivalent of a built-in cable 
set-top box. These DCR (or digital cable–ready) TVs use a small smartcard 
known as the CableCARD, which you rent from your cable TV provider. With 
a CableCARD, you can skip the set-top box, but you lose some of its features, 
such as video-on-demand (VoD) and an onscreen cable guide. See the sidebar 
titled “Can I see your CableCARD please?” for more information.
The big difference between DSS and digital cable, in our minds, is the fact 
that DSS gives you a choice of receivers (that you have to pay for), whereas 
digital cable gives you no choice. You rent the digital cable set-top box as 
part of your monthly service fee, and you get what the cable company gives 
you. The advantage of this approach is that the cable company has to fix or 
replace your set-top box if it stops working, but the disadvantage is that you 
can’t choose a set-top box that has the features you want. Like Model Ts, 
they come in any color you want, as long as it’s black.
 
The other big difference between DSS and digital cable is one that we can’t 
measure ourselves (we’d need to invest much of our book royalties on the 
test gear) but which we’ve heard many industry experts tell us: Many cable 
companies compress the analog NTSC signals carried over digital cable more 
What about analog cable?
Most cable companies now offer digital cable 
service. They have to if they want to compete 
with the DSS guys, and they can do so if they’ve 
also upgraded their cable plants to two-way in 
order to offer cable modem Internet access 
(which most cable companies have done). In 
a few areas, however, you’re still stuck with 
analog cable. There’s nothing inherently wrong 
with analog cable. It was good enough for the 
cable TV industry to convince about 70 percent of 
Americans to buy their service in the first place, 
but it’s not a particularly sexy service. If you need 
or want to get analog cable into your home thea-
ter, there’s not a lot that needs to be done.
Any TV purchased in the past five to ten years 
(and certainly any TV you may shop for when 
building a home theater) is cable ready, with 
one big exception: Some high-end TVs (such 
as plasmas and front-projection models) ship 
as monitors without a built-in TV tuner. Besides 
this small group, any modern TV should be able 
to plug directly in to an analog cable system and 
work without any extra pieces or parts. In a few 
cable systems, you need a set-top converter 
box (the analog equivalent to a digital set-top 
box) to get pay-per-view or certain movie chan-
nels, often called premium channels.
Although most home theater builders will move 
up to digital cable or DSS, there’s still a place 
for analog cable. For example, a basic analog 
cable package (which might cost less than $20 
a month) is a good way to add local channels 
to your DSS-based home theater system, par-
ticularly if you live in an area where over-the-
air broadcast is spotty and you can’t get local 
channels via DSS. If Pat ever switches to DSS, 
he’s going to keep his basic analog cable ser-
vice for two reasons: He has a cable modem 
that he can’t live without, and he gets all the 
Padres games on cable and can’t get them any-
where else.

99
 Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
than the DSS providers do. Because MPEG-2 is a lossy compression technology 
(when MPEG-2 files are uncompressed for viewing, some of the original data 
is lost), this extra compression means your picture is less sharp and detailed 
than it would be at a lower compression level.
It’s not all bad news, however. Going with digital cable over DSS has two big 
advantages:
 
 Digital cable systems always carry all your local channels (they’re 
required to by law). You might even get local cable-only channels that 
you might never get over DSS (if you live in a rural area) or with a broad-
cast TV antenna.
 
 Digital cable systems are two-way systems, communicating back to the 
cable company over the same line that carries your cable TV to you. 
So you don’t need a phone line (like you do with DSS), and you can do 
neat interactive TV stuff with digital cable. In many areas, you can do 
video-on-demand (or VoD) over a digital cable system. (We talk about 
VoD in more detail at the end of this chapter.)
 
Another great feature of cable is that it is generally immune to weather phe-
nomena that can cause DSS services to freeze up or blur. Obviously, a big 
storm could blow over the poles that carry your cable signal into your home, 
but you won’t have to worry about heavy winds or rain affecting your signal as 
you do with satellite.
Making a decision between DSS and digital cable is tough. In some parts of 
the country, however, the decision won’t be difficult at all. Digital cable may 
not be available, or it may be in a primitive state (for example, no HDTV 
channels, no VoD, and fewer channels than DSS). In these cases, it helps to 
have either a good dealer or a lot of friends with home theaters so that you 
can judge different systems with your own eyes.
Antennas Make a Comeback
Remember the good old days? Yeah, neither do we, but we can remember 
a day (not so long ago) when all the homes in our neighborhood sported 
rooftop TV antennas, sort of like how many homes in our neighborhood now 
sport rooftop DSS dishes. For most of us, the rooftop TV antenna (and its 
close ally, the back-of-the-set rabbit ears) went the way of black-and-white 
TVs and dodos a long time ago. Tuning in to broadcast TV was just too much 
of a pain in the butt compared to the plug-and-play of cable (or the “have a 
professional aim it and then play” of DSS).
But a funny thing happened on the way to obsolescence. Antennas became hip 
again. HDTV is the reason. (It’s always the reason for us, but we’re like that.)

100
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Moving everyone to ATSC and HDTV
HDTV is the reason because our good buddies at the FCC (the Federal 
Communications Commission) came up with a ruling a few years back that 
made a huge deal with every single TV broadcaster in the nation. The deal 
was this: We’ll give you an extra chunk of the airwaves for a second TV chan-
nel absolutely free, but you have to use it to broadcast digital TV (and even-
tually you have to give us back your old channel so we can use it for other 
purposes, like wireless Internet connections).
Now this deal was supposed to be totally complete by 2006. And when we say 
totally, we mean that by 2006, every single station in America was supposed to 
be broadcasting all its programming digitally, using one of the many different 
digital TV (ATSC) formats. Well, as we write, that has not happened, but almost 
all stations across the U.S. are now broadcasting both digital and analog signals.
The next step in the digital TV transition is for the few remaining analog-only 
holdouts to begin transmitting digital TV and then — the big step — for all 
stations to turn off their analog broadcasts. The new deadline for this step is 
February 17, 2009. By that date, all older analog TVs will need an inexpensive dig-
ital TV tuner that will pick up the over-the-air digital signals and convert them to 
an analog signal that older TVs can pick up. In Chapter 13 we talk about TVs with 
built-in ATSC (digital TV) tuners — most new TVs these days have this feature, 
and before 2009, all TVs with any kind of tuner built-in will as well.
The government is helping the transition along. In the summer of 2002, the FCC 
made a ruling that, by 2007, every TV sold in America must have a receiver 
that can get ATSC broadcasts. Keep in mind, this doesn’t mean that these TVs 
will be able to display HDTV (for example, they might not have a high enough 
resolution, or they may not be able to display widescreen content properly), 
but they will be able to receive it and display it at lower resolutions and at a 
4:3 aspect ratio. Eventually, when enough of these TVs are in people’s homes, 
analog TV as we know it will go away, replaced by ATSC and HDTV. The gov-
ernment is also helping by offering a rebate check to anyone who purchases 
one or two DTV tuners for their older analog TVs. We suspect that you will have 
a digital TV in your home theater, but this rebate could come in handy for that 
spare TV in the guest room or garage that only picks up over-the-air channels. 
Check out www.dtv.gov for all the details.
This transition has caused a revitalization of the TV antenna industry. DSS and 
some digital cable systems carry a few HDTV stations, but they each have severe 
limitations to how many they can fit on their systems because HDTV is a band-
width hog. It uses a lot more bandwidth than NTSC programming does — espe-
cially when the NTSC has been compressed using MPEG-2 — and bandwidth is 
a limited commodity on cable and DSS systems. To give more to HDTV means 
taking some away from something else. It’s a zero sum game.
Sorry for the long background discussion, but we really felt it was important 
to understand what’s happening before we discuss what you can do today.

101
 Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
Picking up ATSC with an antenna
Today, if you live in or around a large city, you can pick up ATSC program-
ming by hooking up an antenna and tuning it into your local broadcasters. If 
you live in a smaller town, you may have to wait it out for a while. The costs 
of putting in the new transmission and other broadcast station equipment to 
do ATSC are high, and small are having a hard time affording the job and also 
of finding the resources to do it — so some will be broadcasting analog right 
up to the cut-off time in 2009.
 
Some low-power stations are typically found in rural areas or in geographi-
cally odd regions where the main tower can’t reach — in Pat’s home in San 
Diego a low-power station is in the toney La Jolla neighborhood because the 
public broadcasting station’s tower doesn’t reach into the ocean cliff-side $30 
million homes very well. These low-power and booster stations will be allowed 
to continue broadcasting in analog for the foreseeable future.
 
Before you start investing in an antenna, check with your local broadcasters 
and see who has ATSC channels up and running. You can also look online at 
www.hdtvpub.com. Just type in your zip code and find out who’s broadcast-
ing in your area.
The law requires these TV stations to broadcast in ATSC, not HDTV. HDTV is 
a subset of ATSC (check back in Chapter 4 if you missed this distinction). In 
general, of the 18 formats allowed under ATSC, we consider only 2 of them, 
720p and 1080i, to be HDTV.
 
We focus on ATSC antennas here, and not older NTSC antennas, but the same 
general characteristics apply to each.
You can choose from both indoor and outdoor antennas. Indoor antennas 
work just fine if you are lucky enough to live in an area with great signals 
coming over the air, but most people get better results with outdoor anten-
nas. Outdoor antennas are further categorized by three features:
 
 Size: We won’t spend too much time explaining the concept of size to 
you, but ATSC antennas fit into small, medium, and large groups.
 
 Directionality: Some antennas (multidirectional) can pick up signals 
coming from any point of the compass, whereas others (directional) 
need to be aimed toward the incoming signal.
 
 Amplification: Most antennas are unamplified (meaning they don’t have 
an electronic signal booster), but for weak signals, some antennas use 
a small preamplifier to boost the signals and help your TV tuner decode 
them.

102
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Tuning in over-the-air HDTV can be tricky. The good news is that digital 
broadcasts are free of the snow, fade, and other things that made broadcast 
analog TV so frustrating. The bad news is that instead of these distortions, 
digital broadcasts tend to be, well, digital. In other words, they’re either on 
(working) or off (nothing, nada, zip). It’s not even a matter of being too far 
from the broadcast tower either. We’ve heard of people being too close or 
being in the right range but behind a hill.
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has developed a great system 
to help you figure out which kind of antenna you need to get ATSC signals in 
your home. Go to its Web site at www.antennaweb.org, type some basic 
address information, and its database spits out an antenna recommendation 
for you. The CEA even has a color-coding system that participating antenna 
manufacturers put on the outside of their boxes so you can choose the right 
one at the store. Very handy.
Neat Network-based Services
As service providers (such as cable companies) have spent their billions of 
dollars building broadband networks for Internet access and digital cable, 
they’ve come across one big issue: They need to make money to pay back this 
investment. So they are constantly looking for new services that take advan-
tage of these high-speed networks — services they can charge users for.
Well, we’re often leery when service providers try to charge us more (well, 
not really; our day job is helping them figure out what these services might 
be!), but we definitely think that these new services are a case in which the 
customer also wins. These companies are looking at offering lots of differ-
ent entertainment services (including neat stuff such as video games on 
demand), but the two most interesting (in our minds) are the following:
 
 Video-on-demand (VoD): Like to watch movies but hate to go to the 
video store? One alternative is to join a service that does movie rent-
als online (and via the U.S. mail), such as Netflix (www.netflix.com). 
Another cool way to watch movies is to use a VoD service (now being 
offered by many cable companies as a part of digital cable services). 
VoD is kinda like pay-per-view (PPV). You pay for individual movies and 
shows, and you watch them on your cable-connected TV. But the simi-
larities end there because VoD movies aren’t run as scheduled broad-
casts (like every hour on the hour). Instead, VoD movies are stored on 
big computers (video servers) as MPEG-2 files. When you want to watch 
one, you simply select it on your onscreen guide and press Play on your 
remote. The movie gets streamed to your set-top box (just like movies 
you watch on the Internet, but at a much higher quality) and played 
back on your TV. You have complete control of the stream, so just like 
using a VCR or DVD player, you can start, stop, pause, fast forward, and 
rewind — the works — all for the same cost as regular PPV. One other 

103
 Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
neat VoD service is called SVoD (subscription VoD), which allows you 
to subscribe to a certain channel or show, such as HBO, and get VoD 
access to all the episodes of a favorite show (such as The Sopranos).
 
 Networked PVRs: This is a more futuristic service, but it’s on the verge 
of appearing on the market. Networked PVR is a cross between regular 
personal video recorders (PVRs), such as ReplayTVs, and VoD. Like 
a PVR, a networked PVR records the shows you want to save on a big 
computer hard drive. But like VoD, this big computer hard drive is 
located in the service provider’s office, not in your home theater. So 
you tell the system what you want to save, and it saves it in a central-
ized location. When you want to watch, you just click a button on your 
remote, and the programming is streamed to your TV over the cable 
company’s broadband network. You can still do all the fast forward and 
pause stuff you do on a regular PVR, but you have no extra boxes in 
your home theater and nothing to buy, except for a monthly fee.
Getting TV from Ma Bell
Many folks now have a fourth choice when it comes to getting TV broadcasts. 
That’s because the phone companies (believe it or not!) are getting into these 
services. Phone companies are installing new high-speed technologies (such 
as faster versions of the DSL Internet service they offer now, and even faster 
fiber optic–based services) that allow them to compete with the cable com-
panies. It seems fair enough, considering that cable companies are now start-
ing to offer Internet access and long distance services.
A phone company can offer television services in two ways:
 
 By providing cable-like services over their phone networks: This is 
what Verizon is doing with its FiOS service — using a separate wave-
length (or color of light) on its newly installed fiber optic to carry what 
is essentially a standard digital cable TV signal to the home. In this 
case, the cable signal is carried over fiber right up to the side of the 
house, and then converted to a traditional coaxial cable network inside 
the home. This isn’t all that different than what the cable companies 
do — they’ve got a lot of fiber in their networks too, but the “last mile” 
of cable connecting to the sides of customers homes is copper coaxial 
cable.
 
 By providing IPTV services: IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) is an entirely 
different way of offering TV services, using the same standard Internet 
systems used for carrying Web pages, e-mail (and yes, even Web video) 
to your TV over a broadband Internet connection. This is what AT&T is 
doing with its uVerse system and what many smaller TV providers are 
doing throughout the United States, Canada, and the rest of the world.

104
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
The biggest difference between IPTV and more traditional TV services 
(whether they’re carried over the phone network or a cable company’s net-
work) is what is being carried over those wires at any given time. In a tradi-
tional system, all channels being broadcast are sent to everyone’s home all at 
once (we’re ignoring VoD here, which is a special case). So that wire running 
through your walls has all 500 (or more!) channels on it at once, and your TV 
or set-top box simply tunes in to the channel you want when you want it. IPTV 
is a radical shift because the wires running into your home and TVs carry only 
the channels you have selected to watch right now. When you change chan-
nels, a signal is sent back to the network, and a video server device in the net-
work selects that different channel and begins to stream it to your TV.
Note: This is a vast oversimplification, but it covers about 95 percent of the 
truth of the situation. In fact, VoD selections in a traditional system work 
pretty much like IPTV (but they’re only a small part of what comes over the 
wire), and IPTV systems often will send you several channels at once in antic-
ipation that you’ll be wanting to change channels.
So what’s the difference from a user perspective? Well if everything worked 
ideally, you really wouldn’t see one. But in the real world, there are a few 
things to keep in mind:
 
 IPTV can potentially offer you more channels. Any cable or cable-like 
system (even Verizon’s FiOS system with its fiber-optic connection) has 
a limited amount of bandwidth. At some point, that big fire hose of 500 
channels that you’re drinking from will be full, and there won’t be room 
for any additional channels. So if you really (really!) want the Tibetan 
Yak Milking Channel and your provider is out of capacity in the network, 
you’re out of luck. In an IPTV network, there’s essentially an unlimited 
capacity for new channels (even HDTV channels), as long as the TV pro-
vider can make a business justification to offer it to you. Because IPTV 
doesn’t need to fit all those channels onto the cables running into every-
one’s home all at once, it can offer a wider range of channels.
 
 Conversely, IPTV can’t offer you as many channels at once. IPTV is 
limited by the bandwidth of the broadband (DSL or fiber-optic) con-
nection running into your home. If you have a fast DSL connection, 
you might be getting 20 or 30 Mbps of bandwidth. Each TV channel 
(standard definition) can take up 2 to 4 Mbps of that bandwidth, while 
each HDTV channel you want to watch can take between 10 and 20. Do 
the math — two HDTV channels can use up all the bandwidth on your 
broadband connection. As an example here, Pat tried the AT&T ser-
vice when it came out in San Diego in 2007 — and promptly dropped it 
because, at the time, it allowed only one HDTV channel at a time in the 
entire house (they’re up to two now). Imagine a scenario like this: Pat’s 
watching House on the HDTV downstairs when his wife decides to tune 
in to a rerun of Grey’s Anatomy (ahh . . . McDreamy) upstairs on the 
bedroom HDTV. Poof — one of the screens goes blank (literally). Not a 
recipe for domestic bliss and tranquility.

105
 Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
 
 Even if you have only one HDTV, this can still be problem. If you have 
a PVR, you may want to record one program while you watch another. 
Some IPTV systems won’t let you do this (at least in the realm of HDTV). 
Also, keep in mind that the broadband connection you’re using for IPTV 
is the same one you’re using for Internet and potentially phone calling 
(if you have a VoIP service such as Vonage). The more you use it for 
TV, the less you have left for downloading gigantic files or watching 
YouTube on your laptop while your wife is watching Grey’s Anatomy on 
the big-screen downstairs (hey, some of us like to multitask!).
 
 We don’t mean to scare you off of IPTV here. Pat’s experience was in 
the early days of IPTV — if you have only one HDTV in the house, you’ll 
probably never notice the issue, even with a DVR. But it’s something to 
keep in mind in an era when HDTVs start at around $500 and you can 
have one in every room in the house without breaking your budget.
In the final analysis, which technology a phone company uses isn’t a huge 
deal. The technologies have a good deal of overlap (as we mentioned, VoD 
services are essentially IPTV offered as part of a “traditional” cable-style TV 
service). And over time, as the technology improves, even cable companies 
are considering a move to IPTV. What you should keep in mind are the attri-
butes of the services you have available:
 
 What do they cost?
 
 How many channels do they offer?
 
 Which channels do they offer?
 
 What are the hidden costs (monthly rentals for set-top boxes, for example)?
 
 How many channels can you receive at one time (for IPTV)?
 
 How many HDTV channels can you receive at one time (again, for IPTV)?
 
 What other features are offered (VoD, audio/radio channels, and so on)?
What we want to let you know here is that your telephone company may very 
well be a viable competitor to your cable company (and to satellite TV). And 
more choices typically means better service!
DVRs Rock!
One of the biggest advances in TV watching over the past decade or so has 
been the advent of the DVR, or digital video recorder (often also called PVR 
with personal replacing digital). DVRs are basically purpose-built comput-
ers that record video onto a standard computer hard drive. Think of it as a 
computer-based VCR. There are no tapes to wear out, break, or jam — just a 
fast, reliable computer hard drive.

106
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Actually, the metaphor of a DVR being like a computer-based VCR sells the 
DVR short. Using a DVR is soooo much better than using a VCR that it’s hard 
to begin to describe the benefits of the DVR. Don’t just take our word for it, 
look at these things you can do with a DVR but not with a VCR:
 
 Play back one recorded show while simultaneously recording another.
 
 Pause live TV (if you’re recording it on your DVR).
 
 Skip the commercials with the click of a button if you are recording 
the show and have started watching a few minutes past the start time. 
(Broadcasters hate this feature and are suing some DVR vendors.)
 
 Let the DVR automatically record your favorite show every time it’s on. 
(All DVRs connect to a program service, usually via a telephone line, 
that has a complete program guide for weeks at a time, customized for 
your area.)
 
 Use the program service to help you find shows.
 
 Connect some DVRs to a computer network (some models even have 
built-in wireless network connections) and the Internet so you can share 
recordings with your friends or send copies of shows you’ve recorded to 
your DVR at your vacation home (if you have one).
The major manufacturer of DVRs is TiVo (www.tivo.com). The company 
pioneered the technology and remains the only large manufacturer of 
standalone DVRs (meaning an independent device that functions solely as a 
DVR — as you’ll see next, DVRs are also integrated into set-top boxes and 
satellite receivers).
TiVo has two models of DVRs: the Series 2 ($149.99), which is a standard 
definition model, and the $299.99 TiVo HD DVR, which (as the name implies) 
records high-definition content. Both models can record up to two shows 
at a time and include a number of cool features, such as the ability to bring 
Internet content (for example, YouTube) to your TV and the ability to con-
nect over your home network to your PCs and portable devices using TiVo’s 
Desktop Software. A TiVo DVR requires a monthly service plan that starts at 
$12.95 a month, but you can pay less if you buy a long-term plan (if you want, 
you can spend $400 on a lifetime plan).
Beyond TiVo, the real action in the DVR world these days comes in the form 
of PVRs that are integrated into other devices. The most common place you’ll 
see this is within a cable or satellite set-top box (and for those of you who 
can get TV services from the phone company, in their set-top boxes as well).
Integrating the DVR into the set-top box has several huge advantages:

107
 Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
 
 It makes setup and operation easier. With the DVR hardware and soft-
ware as part of the set-top box itself, you have nothing to hook up and 
nothing to configure; it’s just there. (Getting a standalone DVR config-
ured to control your set-top box or satellite receiver is a major pain in 
the rear end.)
 
 The whole experience is more integrated. As we discuss in Chapter 7, 
most TV providers include onscreen programming guides, video on 
demand, and more. DVR becomes just another one of these functions 
and is tightly integrated into the experience — so setting up a recording 
is typically the work of one or two button pushes while you’re looking at 
your onscreen guide.
 
 They can support HDTV. This is the biggest deal for us. Both satellite and 
cable providers are offering HDTV DVRs that can record and play back 
high-definition TV broadcasts, to which we can only say, “Thank you!”
 
 They can support two-tuner operation. Standalone DVRs can typically 
record only one show at a time, so you can watch a show while record-
ing it, or watch a recording while recording another show, but that’s it. 
Most cable or satellite DVRs are two-tuner models that allow you to view 
and record two shows at a time. This gives you the ability to watch one 
show while recording a different show or even record two shows at a 
time while watching a recording of a third show. You’d have to be a real 
TV junkie to miss anything with this capability.
 
 They might not cost anything up-front. While standalone DVRs require 
cash out of your pocket to buy the unit, most cable and many satellite 
DVRs don’t cost you anything up-front. You simply pay a monthly ser-
vice fee (which you also would pay for standalone DVRs), and you don’t 
need to buy any equipment.
Most people tend to choose the DVRs provided by their TV service 
provider — it’s easier and cheaper to do so. TiVo shouldn’t be ruled out, 
though — TiVo’s user interface is unmatched, and the additional feature set 
is top notch. Remember, though, that TiVo will cost a bit more over time, 
and it is not compatible with satellite (or telephone company-provided) TV 
services.
All we know for sure is that we gotta have our DVRs (no matter who makes 
them). It’s simply a must for our home theaters, and if you ever use a DVR, 
we’re sure it will become a must for your home theater, too.
 
You can also use a PC as a DVR. We talk about this more in Chapter 9.

oday’s video gaming systems are crammed full of high-powered audio 
and graphics chips that can put your home theater through its paces. 
With DVD-based games, you get audio that can use all the speakers in your 
surround-sound system and video that can fill up your screen. Video games 
aren’t just kids’ toys anymore; they can be an integral part of your home 
theater experience!
In this chapter, we talk about how video consoles can fit into your home 
theater system. (Okay, we realize some folks think they shouldn’t play any 
role whatsoever, but we disagree — and you’ll soon discover why.) We talk 
about the leading console systems as well as how you might bring PC gaming 
systems into your home theater. By the way, we think game consoles are the 
best way to bring gaming to the big screen, but if you’re handy with your PC, 
you can get a great gaming experience with a gaming PC as well.
Integrating Cool Consoles 
into Your Home Theater
If you have (or are considering buying) a modern gaming console, such as 
an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, you need to be thinking about how you plan to 
integrate it as a source device (in other words, a device that provides audio 
and video) into your home theater. Yeah, we know — some “high end” home 
theater folks might be cringing right now. Let ’em. We think video games fit 
into even top-of-the-line home theaters.

110
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Game consoles are, of course, built for video games, but if you’re not deep of 
pocket, you might even think about letting your game console do double duty 
as your DVD player (yep, they can do that) or even as a high-definition Blu-
ray disc player (as discussed in Chapter 6). Most of the consoles we discuss 
here can replace a DVD player or a CD player or both in your home theater, 
and more importantly, all of them can be a heck of a lot of fun. In the follow-
ing sections, we give you an overview of the different consoles and how you 
can integrate them into your home theater.
 
When we say a game console is fast, we’re not talking about how many MHz 
the processor operates at or other computer-centric measures of speed 
(though these are important). Rather, we’re talking about how much informa-
tion the console can push up onto the TV screen when it’s playing a game. 
(Okay — when you’re playing a game and the console is processing the game.) 
Most experts use the number of polygons per second as a measurement for 
speed, and that’s a pretty good measure, although some gaming experts use 
other graphics measurements.
Playing with Sony’s PlayStations
Sony has been leading the way in the game console world for years now, first 
with its popular PlayStation, then with the PlayStation 2, and now with the 
PlayStation 3. (The names don’t get any more original as time goes by, but 
the performance remains truly exceptional!)
In with the new: PlayStation 3
Sony’s top-of-the-line gaming console is the PlayStation 3 (or PS3). The PS3 
was designed specifically for high-performance gaming in a home theater 
with an HDTV display. (Say that three times fast.) The PS3 is built around 
an entirely new kind of CPU called the Cell processor, designed by IBM with 
a little help from Sony and Toshiba. The Cell processor has multiple inde-
pendent processing sections (called Synergistic Processing Elements, if you 
want to get technical) that give the PS3 the ability to render video at rates 
previously unheard of for consumer-grade computing devices. You’ve prob-
ably heard various PC and gaming manufacturers describe their systems as 
“supercomputer-like” over the years — this one truly is.
 
Because the PS3 includes a built-in Blu-ray disc player (see Chapter 6), it can 
support high-definition optical discs for playing movies, and the capacity of 
Blu-ray (well over 20GB of data per disc) lets game makers cram a ton of detail 
into their game software. Just as importantly, the PS3 makes a great choice 
for your home theater’s Blu-ray disc player. The PS supports all the video 
formats of Blu-ray (including 1080p24) over its HDMI output, and because it’s 
essentially a computer at heart, is easily upgradeable to support new Blu-ray 
features such as BonusView and BD-Live (check out Chapter 6 if you’re not 
sure what these features do). All for a price that’s little more than most single-
purpose, Blu-ray disc players on the market.

111
 Chapter 8: Gaming Galore 
Other features of the PS3 include
 
 Built-in wireless networking: You can easily connect to Internet online 
gaming services through your Wi-Fi network, as well as an Ethernet con-
nection for wired networks.
 
 A powerful graphics chip: The chip, developed by NVIDIA, processes 
the gaming graphics and displays them on your screen at the highest 
possible resolution.
 
 Connections galore: Connections include HDMI outputs for connect-
ing to your high-definition display (component video is also available) 
and optical and coaxial digital audio outputs for connecting to your A/V 
receiver for Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1-channel surround sound.
 
 Wireless (Bluetooth) controllers for cord-free game play: You can 
connect up to seven of these wireless controllers (called Sixaxis con-
trollers). They even include a less sophisticated version of the motion 
control found in the Wii gaming console.
 
 A hard disc drive (most versions): Store gaming data as well as your 
own pictures, music, and video. The PS3 can send this content to your 
home theater’s display and audio system.
 
 Two USB 2.0 (high-speed) ports: Connect peripheral devices such as 
digital cameras. The PS3 also includes a built-in card reader for Sony’s 
Memory Stick format as well as the SD and Compact Flash formats used 
by other camera manufacturers.
 
 A Web browser: Surf the Web or check your e-mail, all from the comfort 
of your favorite sofa!
Prices for the Playstation 3 range from about $400 to $600, depending on 
which bundle you choose. The bundles vary in terms of hard drive size, the 
number of controllers, and the included games.
But not out with the old: PlayStation 2
The best-selling gaming console of all time is Sony’s PlayStation 2 (known 
among the in crowd as PS2). This cool black slimline box (now also available 
in silver!) has a 300 MHz processor under the hood, which might not sound 
like much in PC terms, but this processor is especially designed for gaming 
and can really crank out the video. The processor includes secondary pro-
cessors, called floating-point processors, that help the PS2 do the math on a 
game’s polygons (remember polygons from geometry?) at supercomputer 
speeds.
Besides this high-powered processor, the PS2 includes a bunch of additional 
features:

112
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 A powerful graphics chip: The Graphics Synthesizer chip does the work 
of creating all the pixels (or colored dots) that show up on your TV 
screen as the game video. For you tech types out there, this is a 256-bit 
graphics chip.
 
 32MB of RAMBUS: RAMBUS is a high-speed type of RAM or computer 
memory, and it holds all the computer instructions and codes that make 
up the game.
 
 A DVD-ROM drive: This drive plays the optical discs containing the PS2 
games and can also play PlayStation 1 games, movie DVDs, and CDs.
 
 Lots of ports and connections: You get the following:
 
• Two gaming controller ports. (The controllers are the physical 
interface between you and the game.)
 
• Two USB ports. USB stands for Universal Serial Bus — like on a PC.
 
• Two memory card slots (to store game data, such as your current 
level in a game), as well as an expansion bay that lets you install a 
computer hard drive for even more storage.
 
• An Ethernet port that lets you connect your PS2 to your home 
network for networked and online gaming (this is standard only on 
PS2s built since 2004, but folks with older PS2s can buy an expan-
sion kit that includes Ethernet).
 
• A single i.LINK port (Sony’s name for IEEE 1394 or FireWire — a 
super-high-speed connection used for all sorts of computer-related 
devices, such as hard drives and digital video cameras) that lets 
you connect multiple PS2s for head-to-head gaming.
 
 We talk about these fancy connections in Chapter 16.
You can find out more about the PS2 (and the hundreds of games available 
for it) online at www.playstation.com.
Xbox marks the spot
Microsoft hasn’t just let Sony own the gaming console business. In fact, it’s 
quickly established itself as the number-two console maker and may move 
ahead of Sony with its latest console, the Xbox 360 — which beat the PS3 to 
market by at least six months.
Get your HDTV gaming on with the Xbox 360
Microsoft didn’t just rest on its laurels with the Xbox; it went back to the 
drawing boards and came out with an entirely new, better, and faster console 
at the end of 2005: the Xbox 360.

113
 Chapter 8: Gaming Galore 
The Xbox 360 uses a custom version of the IBM PowerPC chip, with three 
cores (or independent processing units) providing a huge speed boost over 
the older Intel chips in the original Xbox. The 360 also includes a much faster 
graphics processing unit from ATI that can support high-definition (1080i) 
video on your HDTV.
Other features of the Xbox 360 include
 
 512MB RAM: Eight times the memory in the original Xbox for faster 
access to gaming software. (You always get better response times when 
you access your game in RAM rather than from the DVD or other optical 
drive.)
 
 A 32-bit audio processor: This supports 5.1-channel Dolby Digital sur-
round sound.
 
 A wireless controller system: No need to worry about tripping over the 
cords; the Xbox 360 offers wireless controllers that operate in the 2.4 
GHz frequency band (the same frequencies used by Wi-Fi). Note that this 
is an optional component — not all Xbox 360s include these controllers 
in the package. You can “connect” up to four controllers at once using 
the wireless system.
 
 An optional hard drive: Two of the three Xbox 360 models include hard 
drives for storing your photos, music, and video for playback in your 
home theater.
 
 Network capabilities: The Xbox 360 includes an Ethernet networking 
port that lets you connect your console to a home network for online 
gaming and for media purposes (such as playing video and audio files 
on your PC). Microsoft also sells an 802.11 (Wi-Fi) wireless networking 
adapter that lets you connect to a wireless network (802.11a or 802.11g).
 
 When you read that the Xbox 360 has “built-in wireless” capabilities, 
remember that this is for the controllers. If you want to use the wireless 
networking capability to connect your Xbox 360 to a home network and 
the Internet, you need this optional 802.11 networking adapter.
 
 Front USB ports: The Xbox 360 has two USB ports hidden under a 
port on the front of the unit (and a third USB port on the back) that let 
you connect devices such as an iPod, a Sony PSP (handheld gaming 
machine), or even a digital camera.
 
 Media Center capabilities: This is one of our favorite features of the 
Xbox 360 — if you have a Windows XP Media Center Edition PC, you 
can use your Xbox 360 as a Media Center extender that will allow you 
to access the TV, music, photos, and video functionality of your Media 
Center PC over your home’s wired or wireless network. So you can have 
your media stored on the Media Center PC in your home office and use 
the Xbox 360 to access and enjoy the media in your home theater. Pretty 
darned cool if you ask us.

114
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
The Xbox 360 comes in three versions. Xbox 360 Elite is the fancier package, 
with a 120GB hard drive and an HDMI cable. Xbox 360 comes with a smaller 
20GB hard drive and no HDMI cable. Finally, Xbox 360 Arcade has no hard 
drive and no high-definition cables (neither component video nor HDMI are 
included — you’ll have to spring for the optional cables), but it is the cheap-
est way to get into the world of Xbox 360.
 
If you want to get a lot of detail about the Xbox 360, check out Xbox 360 For 
Dummies, by Brian Johnson and Duncan Mackenzie. Those guys have the 
insider scoop and can give you levels of detail that we simply don’t have room 
to include.
 
Unlike the PS3, the Xbox 360 does not have a built-in optical drive that can 
play high-definition movies (the PS3 has a Blu-ray disc drive built-in). You can 
play DVDs using the Xbox 360’s built-in DVD player, but there’s no support yet 
announced for Blu-ray discs. Microsoft did offer an accessory external HD-DVD 
player for the 360, but that was discontinued in 2008 when the HD-DVD format 
was killed off by Toshiba (see Chapter 6 for more on this event).
Still worth eBaying: the original Xbox
Way back when, in November 2001, Microsoft launched its first competing 
game console — the Xbox (www.xbox.com). If you’ve ever picked one up 
and tried to move it around, you probably already know that this is a serious 
chunk of hardware. And even though it’s old (and discontinued now), it’s still 
a seriously fast gaming console with high-definition capabilities and many 
hundreds of games available.
Not surprisingly, because Microsoft is primarily a PC software company, 
the Xbox has a lot in common with a Windows PC. However, everything has 
been altered, modified, and tweaked for gaming, and you can’t use an Xbox to 
write a book in Microsoft Word. Intel built the main processor, which is a 733 
MHz variant of the Pentium III PC processor. More PC hardware can be found 
in the Xbox in the form of the graphics processor, dubbed the X Chip, which 
NVIDIA built and which is a variant of the company’s GeForce 3 PC video 
cards.
Other cool features of the Xbox include
 
 A built-in 8GB hard drive (like a PC hard drive): You can use the drive 
to save game data or to store audio tracks ripped from your own CDs 
so that you can customize your game soundtracks with your favorite 
music. (Ripping is the process of converting CD audio to files on the 
hard drive, like the creation of MP3 music files.)
 
 64MB of high-speed RAM: This is good for holding the game data that 
the Pentium processor and NVIDIA chip are processing.

115
 Chapter 8: Gaming Galore 
 
 A built-in Ethernet port: Ethernet is the high-speed (10 Mbps) network-
ing system that most computer networks use. Ethernet is also the con-
nection found on the majority of DSL and cable modems for high-speed 
Internet, and this port lets you connect your Xbox to the Internet for 
online gaming — as we discuss in the section, “Playing games online.”
 
 A DVD optical drive for games, CDs, and video DVDs: You’ll need to 
make sure that any Xbox you choose has the optional remote control, 
which plugs in to one of the USB game controller ports and is needed for 
DVD playback.
 
 Ports and slots: You get four USB-type game controller ports (two more 
than the PS2) for multiplayer games, as well as a slot for an 8MB memory 
card.
What’s cool about the Xbox from a home theater perspective is that the Xbox 
was the first console that could display its games on 1080i high-definition TV. 
(It has been joined in this capability by the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3.) 
This means you can have some awesome high-resolution gaming going on 
in your theater. However, as of this writing, few games have been specially 
designed (as they must be) to take advantage of HDTV. But even if games 
aren’t 1080i games, they still work well with (and look good on) HDTVs.
Giving your thumbs a 
break: Nintendo’s Wii
Not to be outdone by Sony and Microsoft, the granddaddy of game consoles, 
Nintendo, has its own new, high-powered home theater–ready gaming con-
sole called the Wii.
 
By the way, Wii is pronounced “we” or “wheeee!,” which is what you’ll say 
when you’re playing it.
 
We need to get one thing (the only real disappointment, in our minds) about the 
Wii out of the way up front. It’s not a high-definition video console. Unlike the 
current generations of Xbox and Playstation, the Wii doesn’t support a 720p or 
1080i/p video output. You’re limited to standard-definition 480p — though you 
can at least select a widescreen output (16:9) to fill your HDTV’s screen. Check 
out Chapter 3 if any of these terms we just threw at you aren’t familiar.
Now let’s talk about the good things about the Wii (and there are a lot of 
them!). First (and foremost, in our minds) is the Wii’s motion-sensing control 
system. The Wii comes with a matched pair of wireless (Bluetooth) control-
lers known as the Wii Remote (all the cool kids call it the Wiimote) and the 
Nunchuck. These controllers include special sensors (both optical, using 
infrared signals, and mechanical, using special miniature sensor chips called 
accelerometers).

116
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
These sensors can tell where your controllers are pointing and which way 
they are moving (and even how fast they are moving). So instead of getting a 
sore thumb trying to hit all the little buttons on a traditional gaming control-
ler, you just move the controller through the air to control the action on the 
screen. Yes, there are still some buttons, but for most games you’ll need to 
use only a few of them. If you’re new to gaming or haven’t done it since you 
owned a pong-playing Atari console in grade school, the Wii is your friend. 
The youngest and oldest gamers can keep up when using the Wii — in fact, 
it’s a huge hit in senior centers.
Some other features of the Wii include the following:
 
 Built-in Wi-Fi networking: You can easily connect to your home 
network and broadband connection for online gaming.
 
 Built-in solid state (flash) memory: Store game information, photos, and 
more.
 
 A memory card slot that accepts SD cards: Use this for adding addi-
tional memory to the console and for displaying photos on the screen.
 
 Two USB ports: Use these ports to connect devices or for additional 
memory.
 
 Some serious horsepower under the hood: The Wii has an IBM Power 
PC CPU and an ATI “Hollywood” graphics chip.
Beyond the lack of HDTV support mentioned earlier, the Wii doesn’t have a 
few other things that the bigger, badder Sony and Microsoft consoles offer:
 
 The Wii doesn’t play DVDs. The Wii uses optical discs for games, but 
they’re a special proprietary type. You can’t play DVDs on a Wii (though 
this feature will eventually be available in future models).
 
 The Wii doesn’t support Dolby Digital or DTS like the other consoles 
do. You have to make do with Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound. See 
Chapter 3 for more on this topic.
 
 The Wii doesn’t come with the higher-quality component video cables 
that give you the highest quality video possible. You need to buy a 
component video cable set as an option.
Despite these shortcomings, we love our Wiis (so do our kids!). We wouldn’t 
recommend that you try to use a Wii as the basis for a home theater (some-
thing you could arguably do with a Blu-ray–disc playing PS3 or even with an 
Xbox 360). But the Wii is (relatively) cheap, at $299, and lots of folks have 
one, sitting right alongside their Xbox 360 or PS3, just for the fun of motion-
sensing games. And it’s not only cheapish but also tiny, about the same size 
as three stacked DVD cases, so it will fit into your home theater room without 
taking up a whole shelf on your rack by itself.

117
 Chapter 8: Gaming Galore 
Playing games online
Playing a video game by yourself can be a lot of fun, but some games are just 
meant to be played head-to-head against a human opponent. It’s a lot more 
fun to blow up your friends than it is to bomb an artificial computer oppo-
nent. Unfortunately, your friends can’t always come over to play — especially 
if, like Pat, you’ve bumped into the big “FOUR OH” and find yourself trying to 
convince your friends to come over to play games. (“Uh, no, you can’t bring 
your baby.”)
Luckily, the broadband revolution that’s given so many of us high-speed 
Internet access at home (using cable modems or DSL) has come to the video 
game world. All three of the gaming consoles we discuss in this chapter now 
have optional online gaming kits that enable you to connect your console not 
only to the home theater but also to the Internet.
This connection opens up a world of new opportunities in game play. Play 
head-to-head against your buddy across town — or across the country. Join 
online games with complete strangers. Whatever floats your boat.
The Xbox 360 comes with online gaming capabilities as well — a Silver level 
is free and lets you join online gaming communities, download (or purchase) 
games online, set up a profile for yourself, and even communicate with 
others via voice (using the Xbox 360’s headset). If you want to get involved in 
playing head-to-head against other gamers online, you need to upgrade to the 
Gold level. Everyone gets a free month of Gold with their Xbox 360 — if you 
like it and want to keep your Gold status, you must pay. There are several 
subscription levels, depending on whether you buy in a store or online, and 
for how long. The one-year subscription purchased online is $49.99. Check 
out www.xboxlive.com for more info.
Playstation 3 users can take advantage of the Playstation Network (http://
www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Network). This is a free network that 
allows game downloads, chat, and online head-to-head networked game play. 
To use Playstation Network, just sign up from your console (its one of the set-
tings options on the PS3’s onscreen display), and you’re ready to go. Certain 
games may require a paid subscription, and you’ll have to pay to download 
some games as well, but the underlying service itself is best described by our 
four favorite letters: F R E E.
The Wii also includes networking capabilities and online game play through 
Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (http://www.nintendowifi.com/). As with the 
other consoles, you can play networked games against others (for free), and 
you can also download and purchase content of all types from Nintendo and 
other providers. Nintendo uses a system called Channels to display various 

118
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
types of content on your TV screen — particularly cool, in our minds, are 
the news and weather channels that let you use the Wii Remote to navigate 
around a virtual globe, finding current news and weather predictions around 
the world just by pointing. The Wii also includes an avatar (an online graphi-
cal representation of yourself) called Mii, which is your face when you go 
online on the Wi-Fi Connection network.
Consoles aren’t just for games
A game console isn’t just fun — it can also be a multipurpose device that 
does more than just games. In fact, all manufacturers of game consoles have 
scores of engineers in white lab coats squirreled away at their headquarters, 
developing new ways that game consoles can be the centerpiece of a home’s 
media room. So, although we’re about to mention a few of the things that 
game consoles can do in the here and now, there’s more to come.
Let’s stay in the present for a moment, however, and look at what game con-
soles can do today:
 
 Play DVD movies: The Xbox, Xbox 360, and PS2 can all do this, although 
neither the Xbox nor the PS2 has progressive-scan DVD functionality. 
(See Chapter 6 if you’re not sure what that means.) The PS3, with its 
built-in Blu-ray disc drive, is capable of playing high-definition movies as 
well as standard DVDs.
 
 Play audio CDs: Again, both the Xbox and the PS2 can play any audio 
CDs when connected to your home theater. The Xbox 360 goes further 
by letting you integrate a USB-equipped portable music player such as 
an iPod into the system. And if you have a Media Center Edition PC or 
Windows XP PC, your Xbox 360 can access all the music you’ve stored 
on that device.
 
 Surf the Web: The PS3 includes a cool Web browser (developed in-
house at Sony) that lets you surf the Web right out of the box. The Wii 
has an optional Web browser called the Internet Channel that you can 
download from the online Wii store for about $5. The Internet Channel is 
actually a special version of the Opera browser (www.opera.com), and 
it works really well — a number of Web sites (such as Google’s Google 
Reader RSS reader program) have been optimized for the Wii Internet 
Channel and the Wii Remote (which acts just like a computer mouse 
when you’re surfing the Web). Unfortunately, the Xbox 360 doesn’t have 
a Web browser — c’mon Microsoft, we’re waiting!
This last item isn’t exactly a typical use of gaming consoles, but it gives you a 
good idea of where consoles are heading — right into the PC mainstream.

119
 Chapter 8: Gaming Galore 
 
Because video game consoles tend to display parts of their images in a static 
fashion — in other words, part of the picture never, or rarely, changes — you 
need to be careful when choosing a television for your video game–enhanced 
home theater. Some projection televisions (mainly those that use CRT picture 
tubes) and some flat-panel TVs (plasma screen TVs) can experience “burn in” 
when you use video games on them a lot. This means that the thin phosphor 
layers that light up to show your picture on these TVs become permanently 
etched with the images from your video game. Check the TV manufacturer’s 
instructions before you use a video game console with one of these TVs.
Integrating PC-based Gaming 
into Your Home Theater
Although most people think of console gaming as something you do in the 
living room (or home theater room) and PC gaming as something you do in 
the home office or at a desk somewhere, PC-based games do have a role in the 
home theater. Speaking even more generally, we think PCs have a place in — or 
connected to — your home theater for a lot of functions. (Read Chapter 9 for 
more on this.)
Gaming on the PC has evolved over the years to be as sophisticated, fast, and 
graphics-rich as console gaming. In fact, if you want the ultimate in gaming 
machines — the no-holds-barred, polygon-generating king of the hill — you 
need to look at a PC, not at a console. And PCs are inherently more network-
able than a console; these days, you have to try hard to find a PC that doesn’t 
have a modem, an Ethernet port, and a dozen other ways to connect to other 
devices and networks. So PC-based gaming can be a great alternative to the 
consoles we discuss earlier in this chapter. You’re no longer limited to that 
Minesweeper game that comes loaded on all PCs.
 
We should mention right up front in this section that purpose-built gaming 
consoles make the most sense for most people in a home theater. They’re 
ready to go out of the box; with Plug-and-Play, they’re simple to connect, set 
up, and play. Most PCs, on the other hand, need some serious tweaking to 
do gaming in a home theater environment (and by that, we mean using the 
surround-sound system and television or monitor of your home theater). So 
keep that in mind.
Upgrading to Vista Home Premium
The easiest way to get your PC involved in your home theater is to go out and 
buy an entirely new PC — one that uses the Media Center Edition software 
included in certain versions of the Vista operating system (the Vista Home 

120
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Premium and Vista Ultimate versions include Media Center). You can find out 
a ton about this new evolution of Windows at Microsoft’s “test drive” site at 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/media
center/default.mspx.
Media Center is all about the convergence of the PC and the TV (and other 
home theater components). It was designed from the ground up as an operat-
ing system and a set of PC hardware that lets you easily connect the PC to 
your home entertainment gear. To get the most out of Media Center Edition, 
you need to buy (or build) a PC that includes some hardware that is designed 
around the new operating system and that will facilitate this new PC-to-TV 
connection.
Media Center Edition PCs usually include the following extra (or enhanced) 
components, compared to a regular PC:
 
 A graphics card (or controller) with a TV Out connection that uses 
component video, S-video, or composite video (RCA) cables to connect 
to your TV or home theater receiver. (Check out Chapter 16 for more 
details on these connections.)
 
 A sound board that can output surround sound using Dolby Digital 5.1. 
(See Chapter 5 for details on Dolby.)
 
 A remote control so you can sit on the couch and click away at your PC.
The only things you need to transform a Media Center PC into a full-fledged 
member of your home theater are the cables to plug things together and, of 
course, the games and controllers that you want to play with.
 
Media Center Edition plays very nicely with the Xbox 360. If you have a Media 
Center Edition–equipped PC anywhere on your home network, you can access 
the content on that PC via your Xbox 360. This won’t necessarily help you do 
PC gaming on your TV, but it’s a nice feature. We talk about this Media Center 
extender technology in Chapter 10.
Building your own gaming PC
You don’t need to get a Media Center PC to get your PC games hooked in to 
your home theater. Creating your own home theater PC is a valid approach — 
as long as you keep in mind that it might take a bit more PC expertise than just 
buying a new PC designed for such use. We talk at length in Chapter 9 about 
how to choose PCs and PC components and accessories as source devices and 
video recorders for your home theater, and the same rules that apply there 
apply to using your PC as a gaming machine in your home theater.

121
 Chapter 8: Gaming Galore 
You need just a couple of things:
 
 A graphics card that can connect to a television and display properly on 
the television (meaning it can output the right resolution for your par-
ticular TV)
 
 A sound card that can connect to your home theater receiver using analog 
(RCA) jacks or a digital connection and that can provide the receiver with 
analog Dolby Pro Logic or (preferably) Dolby Digital signals
That’s basically it. In Chapter 18, we talk more about setting up your PC and 
home Internet connection with your home theater.
Adding Extra Game Controllers
Whatever game system you choose — console or PC, Xbox or PS2 (or Xbox 
360 or PS3) — you need to interface with it. That is the whole point of games: 
interactivity. Of course, by connecting your game system to your home theater, 
you’ve covered how your eyes and ears (and rear end, if you’ve got a big enough 
subwoofer) interface with the system. The other key interface is, of course, your 
hands (and sometimes feet), which connect to your games with a controller.
All game consoles come with one or two basic multipurpose controllers that 
usually have enough buttons and joysticks and four-way pointers to drive us 
adults crazy (though the kids seem to catch on to them right away). These 
controllers (sometimes called gamepads) allow you to play just about any 
game if you can twist your thumbs in the right direction and have the appro-
priate level of dexterity and coordination. You might, however, want to con-
sider some specialized controllers if you have certain games that you simply 
love to play again and again. (You might save yourself from repetitive stress 
injuries this way — and increase your score!)
Some of the controllers you can buy are
 
 Wireless controllers: These are usually just like general-purpose con-
trollers, but they connect by using radio waves, not wires. If you have 
dogs, small kids, or are simply sick of tripping over wires, pick up a pair 
of these wireless wonders.
 
 Wheel controllers: The kids like Mario, but we like Grand Turismo 3 
(at least Pat does). In other words, we want to pretend that we’re not 
stuck in traffic, that we’re Colin McRae zipping through the World Rally 
Championship in our WRX. Thumb buttons don’t cut it for this activity. 
Get a wheel controller that includes brake and accelerator pedals, a big 
fat racing wheel, and a nice short-throw shift knob. Racers, start your 
engines! Check out www.madcatz.com for our favorite wheels.

122
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 Joysticks: Want to pretend you’re “Cool Hand” Grafton’s wing man in 
Flight of the Intruder? Well, need a joystick controller with enough but-
tons to “pickle” your bombs on target. Check out www.thrustmaster.
com for some cool joysticks.
You can buy a ton of controllers (really, we bought one of each and weighed 
them! — okay, that’s a lie), including some funky ones. There are skateboard-
shaped controllers that you stand on for skating, surfing, or boarding games, 
and even one that consists of a mat for replicating dance moves you see 
onscreen. You can find something for everyone, and groovy controllers are 
truly a way to maximize your home theater fun.

F
or years now, a huge digital divide has existed between the PC world 
and the consumer electronics world. You have no doubt been exposed 
to the concept of multimedia in a PC in the form of animations, video games, 
MP3 audio, and maybe even short movie clips. Indeed, the ability to play 
these forms of media is a basic requirement of a multimedia PC.
Similarly, consumer electronics devices have been enabling much of the 
same entertainment content (video games, audio, video, and so on), but 
within its domain — the home entertainment center or home theater.
What most people have been waiting for is a sensible, economical, standard-
ized, and indeed mass-market way to link the two. Well, wait no more — the 
era of the home theater PC is here and now.
In this chapter, we talk about what a home theater PC is, what kinds of pieces 
and parts you need to create a home theater PC out of your present PC, and 
also how you can buy a home theater PC right off the shelf (or off a Web 
page). We also talk a little about the kinds of content (audio and video) that 
your home theater PC can feed into the rest of your A/V gear in your home 
theater (and vice versa).
 
You don’t need to put a PC physically in your home theater to gain access 
to the audio and video content that you might store on the PC. You can 
also look at the various media players and media center extender devices 
discussed in Chapter 10. These devices connect to your home network 

124
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
(and all the PCs on it) and also to the Internet, and adapt the audio and video 
on those networks to a form that can be displayed in your home theater.
 
If you use digital cable as your primary source of broadcast TV, turning a PC 
into a full-fledged personal video recorder (PRV) can be a bit problematic. 
Most of the systems we discuss in this chapter do include hardware and soft-
ware to enable TV viewing and recording, but only a handful of Windows Vista 
systems (with a CableCARD-enabled tuner system) can support encrypted 
digital cable (those scrambled premium channels that require a set-top box 
to descramble and view). When it comes to satellite TV, you’re pretty much 
out of luck when it comes to using the PC’s TV tuner for watching or recording 
TV. In both cases you can use an external set-top box or satellite receiver and 
connect its outputs to the video inputs of the PC. In our opinion, however, this 
is a lot of work (particularly with regards to handling program guides and pro-
gramming recording) that doesn’t offer much benefit when cable and satellite 
PVRs are so inexpensive and capable. However, you may still find that a PC is 
worth incorporating in your home theater for its ability to play DVDs or Blu-
ray discs, serve up digital music files and photos, and access Internet-based 
video. All we’re getting at here is that the PVR functionality we talk about 
in this chapter is most useful if you get your TV over the air or using unen-
crypted cable/digital cable systems.
Meet the Home Theater PC
You should think of a home theater PC (or HTPC, as all the cool kids refer to 
them) as a high-quality source device attached to your A/V system, just as 
you think of a DVD player as a high-quality source device. In fact, if you go 
relatively high end, you can create an HTPC that funnels audio and video into 
your system at a higher quality level than many moderately priced, stand-
alone components. HTPC can be that good.
 
Building an HTPC is not something you can expect to do without a fair amount 
of knowledge about PCs, including some skill at opening up a PC and installing 
new cards and drives and being able to install and troubleshoot drivers (the 
software that integrates hardware devices with the operating system of a PC) 
and other software. We simply don’t have room in this book to give you all 
the nitty-gritty details, but we will give you a good grounding in the essential 
pieces and parts you need to build your own HTPC. If you don’t want to build 
your own, you can buy a ready-to-go version of the HTPC (and we explain how 
later in this chapter).

125
 Chapter 9: Introducing the Home Theater PC 
Sizing up a home theater PC
Depending on your needs, a home theater PC should be able to do some or 
all of the following:
 
 Store audio (music) files: No matter the file type, HTPCs need hard drive 
space and software for audio files.
 
 Store video clips: Homemade camcorder movies, downloaded movie 
trailers, or even downloaded full movies and TV shows belong on the 
HTPC. You need (again) hard drive space and software to make this 
happen.
 
 Play CDs and DVDs: This is an easy requirement because most PCs can 
at least play back CDs, but playing DVDs is also essential in a home 
theater environment.
 
 Act as a DVR (digital video recorder): This is an optional (but almost 
essential, we think) function that uses the HTPC’s hard drive to record 
television shows — essentially making it act like a TiVo or your cable or 
satellite provider’s DVR.
 
 Let you play video games on the big screen: With the right hardware, 
PCs are sometimes even better than gaming consoles (which we cover 
in Chapter 8) in terms of game-type stuff, such as frames per second (or 
things blown to bits per millisecond).
 
 Tune in to online music and video content: You can grab a lot of awe-
some content on the Internet these days. If you pay for this content (and 
you do have to pay for the good stuff, legally speaking), why not enjoy it 
on the big screen and with the good audio equipment?
 
 Provide a high-quality, progressive video signal to your display: All PCs 
have a built-in video system that’s designed to display on a PC monitor 
(which, by the way, is inherently progressive — check out Chapter 4 if 
you don’t remember what this is). Most PCs, however, can’t display on 
a TV, at least not at a high quality. An HTPC needs special hardware — 
which doesn’t cost too much money — to make this happen. (This invest-
ment also gives you better performance on your PC’s monitor, which is 
never bad.)
 
 Decode and send to your display HDTV content: This is another 
optional function but a cool one. With the right hardware inside (an 
HDTV-capable video card and a TV tuner card), HTPCs can provide a 
cheap way to decode over-the-air HDTV signals and send them to your 
home theater display.

126
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Building an HTPC
If the idea of putting together your own HTPC puts a twinkle in your eye, 
this section is for you (and the HTPC we describe here involves a building 
process — although an increasing number of small, specialty PC builders, 
such as the folks at www.digitalconnection.com, will put one together 
for you). So what do you need besides steady hands, nerves of steel, and a 
handy-dandy TORX screwdriver or two? Well, let us tell you. The key pieces 
and parts to any HTPC are the following:
 
 Fast processor: Generally, you need a fast Core II Duo processor (pref-
erably 2.0 GHz or faster) or an equivalent AMD processor. You can get 
away with less, but you might have performance issues (such as DVDs 
having artifacts, or leftover or poorly presented pixels, on the screen 
because the PC can’t keep up the decoding of the DVD’s MPEG content).
 
 Sufficient RAM: For an HTPC, you need at least 2GB of RAM, and 4GB or 
more is a good idea.
 
 A big hard drive: If you’re not planning on saving a lot of video on 
your HTPC (meaning you won’t be using it as a PVR — personal video 
recorder), you can probably get by with a 200GB hard drive. If you are 
going to start doing the PVR thing (or if you’re going to put a lot of MP3 
files on the HTPC), we recommend a much bigger hard drive (think 
terabytes!). You can buy a 750GB drive for about $125, or a terabyte 
(1000GB) drive for about $200, and most nonlaptop HTPCs have room 
for several drives inside.
 
 You should also consider some additional storage for your media on the 
network in the form of a network attached storage (or NAS) system. Big 
PC manufacturers, such as HP, are also selling network storage solutions 
designed to hold media using the Windows Home Server software system.
 
 A powerful, high-quality video card with an appropriate TV inter-
face: This is perhaps the most important feature. You need a graphics 
card that has TV outputs (at least component video outputs, prefer-
ably HDMI). If you’re using a front-projection TV system (see Chapter 
13), you might be able to use a different interface (such as a VGA or 
DVI cable) that is more common to PC applications than home video 
(because many projectors can also be used as PC projectors — in meet-
ing rooms, for example). We like the graphics cards available from ATI 
(www.ati.com) and NVIDIA (www.nvidia.com). Some specific things 
to look for in a video card are the following:
 
• Look for a card with a built-in video processing engine (or VPE). 
These are designed for video.
 
• Don’t look for a gaming card. Super-high-end graphics cards 
designed for the ultimate in PC gaming are typically not optimized 
for video display. They work, but you can probably do better with 
a (cheaper) card designed for video.

127
 Chapter 9: Introducing the Home Theater PC 
 
• Look for a card with a built-in TV tuner. Some products, such as 
ATI’s “All-in-Wonder” series of cards, have a built-in, cable-ready 
TV tuner, so you can plug your cable TV or broadcast antenna 
directly in to the card for TV viewing. Many cards have built-in 
ATSC tuners (see Chapter 7 for more on this topic) so you can tune 
in high-definition TV channels. There are also some systems that 
can handle digital cable TV, but these are typically external boxes 
that plug in to your HTPC’s USB ports.
 
• Remember HDTV. If you’re using your HTPC to record and display 
television signals, you’ll want an HDTV tuner. You can find both 
internal (PCI) cards and external HDTV tuners that plug in to your 
USB ports. So if you want to feed HDTV into your HTPC (wow, acro-
nyms galore — sorry!), you need to add an HDTV tuner card (such 
as the ones made by Pinnacle, www.pinnaclesys.com).
 
• Check the supported output resolutions of the card. If you have a non-
HDTV-ready display unit (such as a regular NTSC direct-view TV), 
you need only a 480-line output (with progressive scan, if your TV 
can handle it). If you have a projection TV or a plasma flat-panel 
TV, it may have a native resolution (which we discuss in Chapters 
13 and 14). Make sure your card can display video at this resolu-
tion (you normally set the resolution of the card by using software 
bundled with your video card).
 
 A high-end audio card: Because you’ll probably be playing surround-
sound formats on your HTPC, you’ll want an audio card that can support 
this. Audio cards may have either a coaxial or an optical output. (Make 
sure you get one that has the same kind as what you have on the back 
of your receiver.) Many sound card manufacturers call this an S/PDIF 
(Sony/Philips Digital Interface) interface.
 
 A CD/DVD-ROM drive: This one is kind of a no-brainer — you’re going 
to want to listen to CDs and watch DVDs. You might, however, also want 
to create your own CDs and DVDs, so consider a DVD-RW/DVD+RW 
drive (that can record DVDs). If you have a slower PC, you might con-
sider adding a hardware device called a DVD decoder — this device 
performs hardware-based decoding of the MPEG video on DVDs, leaving 
your computer’s main processor free to do its thing (like running the 
operating system). You can get DVD decoders from companies such as 
Creative Labs and Sigma Designs (www.sigmadesigns.com).
 
 You should at least consider installing a Blu-ray disc drive in your home 
theater PC. Dozens of them are available, and Blu-ray discs are not only 
the only prerecorded high-definition format on the market, they’re also 
the best in terms of picture quality — even HD content you download 
from online services will be more compressed (and have a worse pic-
ture) than Blu-ray, not to mention the fact that most online content is 
not yet HD. Blu-ray discs can also be used for backup and can hold as 
much as 50GB of data.

128
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 An appropriate operating system: We recommend that you use a 
modern operating system, such as Windows XP/Vista (with the corre-
sponding Media Center or Macintosh OS X. (If you use Linux, you’re on 
your own — though we give a few tips in the “Got Linux?” section.)
 
 Software for playing or recording content: At a minimum, you need 
some MP3 jukebox software to take care of your CD/MP3 playing, stor-
age, and organization needs, and a similar DVD player program. For 
music, we like Musicmatch Jukebox (www.musicmatch.com) or iTunes 
(www.apple.com), and for video, we like InterVideo WinDVD (www.
intervideo.com) — and don’t forget that Microsoft’s built-in-to-the-
system Windows Media Player does a great job with both audio and 
video. A great free option is the VLC Media Player (VideoLAN Client, 
www.videolan.org/vlc), available for Mac, Windows, and Linux! If 
you want to use your HTPC as a PVR, you need some software (and per-
haps hardware) to make that work, which we talk about in the following 
section.
 
 A remote control: Now, very few PCs come out-of-the-box with a remote 
control, but many of the HTPC video and audio cards we’ve discussed 
do. The key attribute of any remote for an HTPC is that the accompa-
nying software can control all your applications — MP3 jukebox, DVD 
player software, and so on. (All these remotes come with software that 
makes the PC recognize them.)
 
We’re focusing on the Windows operating system here, but Apple Macintosh 
computers can also make great HTPCs, with the right accessories and soft-
ware. See the section, “Putting a Mac in your home theater,” for more informa-
tion about Mac-based HTPCs. That’s really all there is to say (at our high-level 
view) about HTPCs. In Chapter 17, we discuss what you need to do to get this 
beautiful, high-tech monster hooked into your home theater.
Getting a TV tuner in your PC
While many HTPC video cards include a built-in 
TV tuner, you can also add a TV tuner to your 
HTPC separately. In fact, even if your video card 
has a tuner, you may want to add an additional 
TV tuner to your PC so that you can record one 
program while watching another (or record two 
at once). Some folks even go beyond two and 
put three or more tuners in their HTPCs.
You can add tuners in two ways: You can install 
an internal card that fits into one of your PC’s 
PCI card slots, or you can add an external tuner 
card that plugs in to a USB 2.0 or FireWire port 
on your PC. If you’re making a laptop PC into an 
HTPC, you’ll probably need to use an external 
tuner card because most laptops don’t have a 
PCI slot for internal cards.

 Chapter 9: Introducing the Home Theater PC 
Getting an HTPC the Easy Way
What if you don’t want to go through all this computer building? Well, your 
friends at Microsoft (really, they’re your friends) got together with a handful 
of their closest PC hardware partners and came up with their own version of 
the HTPC called the Media Center Edition (www.microsoft.com/windows/
products/winfamily/mediacenter/default.mspx).
Media Center (we’re just going to shorten the name to that) is available on 
both the soon-to-be-discontinued Windows XP and the new Vista operat-
ing systems. With Vista (which is standard on most new PCs, though a few 
manufacturers are sticking with XP until Microsoft makes them stop), Media 
Center is part of Vista Home Premium and Vista Ultimate editions (these are 
two of the six versions of Vista available.
 
With Windows XP, you could get Media Center only by buying a new PC with 
Windows XP Media Center Edition preinstalled — along with specific hard-
ware (such as a TV tuner and a remote control) included in the package. 
With the advent of Vista, Microsoft will let you buy and install Media Center 
without buying it on a new PC. An online tool (Windows Upgrade Advisor) at 
the site just listed lets you scope out your PC’s capabilities — this will let you 
see whether your PC can handle Windows Home Premium before you spend 
money on the upgrade.
If you buy a new PC with Media Center, what do you get out of that Media 
Center PC? Well, the details (such as the exact model of graphics card) 
depend on the vendor, but the basic features of a Media Center PC follow:
Understanding Viiv
If you’re looking for a home theater PC, Intel’s 
got your back. It’s created a system called 
Viiv that is based on its latest Core Duo chips 
and includes a range of hardware, software, 
and even service components (meaning that 
various entertainment providers are creating 
music, video, and other entertainment ser-
vices that work specifically with Viiv-based 
equipment). Viiv-equipped PCs (and consumer 
electronics devices) include extra hardware 
and software features on the motherboard 
that provide support for 1080p video, 7.1-chan-
nel audio, enhanced networking, and storage 
features to help you get content onto your PC 
and store it safely. For more information on 
Viiv as well as a list of Viiv-enabled PCs, check 
out www.intel.com/products/viiv/
index.htm.

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 A remote control: All Media Center PCs come with an infrared remote 
control that lets you control the various A/V functions from across the 
room (including other devices, such as cable boxes).
 
 An “advanced” graphics card: We put advanced in quotes because 
that’s Microsoft’s official term for describing it. These “advanced” cards 
almost always include a TV tuner function and a TV output for connect-
ing to your display.
 
 Many Media Center PCs include ATI’s ATI TV Wonder HDTV tuner 
(http://ati.amd.com/products/tvwonderdigital/index.
html). This isn’t inside the PC (as part of the graphics card system), but 
is instead an external HDTV tuner that plugs in to your PC’s USB port. 
The cool thing about the TV Wonder HDTV tuner (beyond the fact that 
it brings HDTV to your PC) is that it’s the only solution we know of that 
uses the CableCARD system (see Chapter 7) for decoding encrypted 
digital cable services. If you’re on digital cable and want to get those 
encrypted premium channels into your PC, this is your only choice.
 
 A hardware encoder: This turns video from your TV source (such as a 
cable TV) into MPEG digital video and turns your Media Center PC into 
a PVR.
 
 A digital audio output: As we discuss in the preceding section, this lets 
you connect your PC to your A/V receiver for surround-sound purposes.
 
 Software that makes it all work: This is the cool part (well, the whole 
thing is cool, but this makes it even cooler). Software to play your MP3s, 
CDs, and DVDs, and to run your PVR is included and well integrated. So 
you don’t have to bend over backwards to make it all work.
A Media Center PC acts just like a regular PC most of the time. You use it for 
e-mail, Web surfing, writing books, and whatever. But when you click the 
remote, the PC shifts over to Media Center mode, and your normal PC desk-
top is replaced by a simplified interface (designed to be read from across the 
room on either a PC display or a home theater display). You can perform all 
the HTPC functions we discuss earlier in the section, “Sizing up a home theater 
PC,” and also play games, manage and display digital photographs, and more.
 
There are dozens of Media Center PC vendors as we write, and more hit the 
market every month. Our favorite model so far is the Alienware Hangar 18 
(www.alienware.com). Check it out; this baby can support up to four TV 
tuners (so you can record three shows and watch a fourth at the same time!) 
and can pack in as many as two terabytes of storage, allowing you to put hun-
dreds of hours of video on its internal hard drives. Plus, it looks just like a 
piece of home theater gear and not like a bland beige PC.

131
 Chapter 9: Introducing the Home Theater PC 
Other HTPC Software Packages
Windows Media Center is the most popular (and easiest) way to get a Media 
Center PC, but it’s not the only such package out there. You can add HTPC 
software and hardware to a Windows PC, or even build an HTPC using a 
Macintosh or a Linux-powered PC.
Building a Windows HTPC
You can build a home theater PC by using one of the following solutions (and 
these aren’t the only ones out there, only the most popular!):
 
 BeyondTV (www.snapstream.com): BeyondTV is SnapStream’s media 
center/DVR software system. It offers a free onscreen program guide, 
customized to your area, and support for multiple TV tuners (for record-
ing more than one program at a time). BeyondTV supports HDTV view-
ing and recording. One neat feature of BeyondTV is its remote recording 
feature that lets you log in and set up recordings from any Web browser, 
including those found on many mobile phones! An optional compo-
nent, BeyondMedia, allows you to control all the media on your PC via 
SnapStream’s interface and your remote control. The price ranges from 
$69.99 for the basic BeyondTV application up to $199.99 for the full 
bundle, which includes the BeyondMedia software and a TV tuner card.
 
 SageTV (www.sagetv.com): SageTV is a cool media center application 
that can control your TV, DVR, music, video, and photos. One feature that 
we like about SageTV is its ability to work across a home network — so 
you can easily access media located on any PC attached to your home’s 
wired or wireless network. You can even access and control the TV tuners 
located on other networked computers, creating, in effect, a whole-home 
DVR system that spans all your TV tuner–equipped PCs.
Leave the PC on the sidelines: Media servers
You can certainly use a PC as a wonderful 
source for home theater content — audio, video, 
television, and so on. But not everyone wants to 
dedicate a PC for this purpose — or even use a 
PC part time for this purpose. An alternative is 
to install a media server in your home network 
that can be used as a whole-home storage 
device for your digital media. In simple terms, a 
media server is a big hard drive with a network 
connection and specialized software that lets 
it stream media data from the hard drive over 
the network to PCs, media adapters, and other 
devices. In Chapter 10 we talk in detail about 
some of the leading home server systems and 
tell you how to integrate them into your home 
theater.

132
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 Pinnacle TV Center Pro (www.pinnaclesys.com): Pinnacle sells both 
hardware and software — TV tuners and DVR/media center software. Its 
top-of-the-line software system, Pinnacle TV Center Pro, is included with 
its PCTV HD Pro Stick and PCTV Ultimate Stick — these are both exter-
nal (USB) HDTV tuners. The PCTV HD Pro Stick can pick up both analog 
and digital (ATSC) TV broadcasts — the PCTV Ultimate Stick adds unen-
crypted digital cable (QAM) broadcasts. The TV Center Pro software 
turns your computer into a PVR. The HD Pro Stick is $99; the Ultimate 
Stick is $129.
Putting a Mac in your home theater
Apple has launched its own answer to the Windows XP Media Center Edition. 
Called Front Row, it’s a media center (in the generic sense) application 
built right into the Macintosh OS X (10.4 Tiger and 10.5 Leopard) operating 
system. Front Row is a combination of software (the Front Row software) and 
hardware (in particular, Apple’s elegant new remote control) that works with 
the inherent media capabilities of Apple’s hardware and software to present 
audio, pictures, downloaded and/or home video, and DVDs on your Mac’s 
display or an attached TV.
What Front Row doesn’t include is functionality for watching or recording 
TV. For that, you need to add hardware (a TV tuner) and software, such as 
Elgato’s EyeTV Hybrid ($149, www.elgato.com) or Elgato’s EyeTV 250 Plus 
($199). These systems include an external TV tuner and decoder hardware 
(which connect to your Mac’s USB or FireWire ports) and DVR software 
(called EyeTV 3) that turn your Mac into a full-fledged DVR.
The Front Row software (everything minus the DVR, in other words) is avail-
able only from Apple — it’s standard on several Mac models, including (as 
we write) the iMac, the Intel-powered MacBook Pro, and the Intel-powered 
Mac Mini. There’s no additional charge for Front Row; it comes as a standard 
feature of these models. We expect Apple will add Front Row to more models 
over time, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see Mac hardware that uses Front 
Row and adds the DVR and TV capabilities that you have to add today.
Got Linux?
If you’re running a PC with the Linux operating system instead of Windows, 
you don’t have to give up on creating an HTPC. In fact, some of the most pop-
ular HTPC media center software packages are available only for the Linux 
operating system.

133
 Chapter 9: Introducing the Home Theater PC 
It ain’t no Myth
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer (as many Linux enthusiasts are), check out 
MythTV (www.mythtv.org) to see whether MythTV will work on your par-
ticular Linux distribution and hardware.
Like most Linux software, MythTV comes with a great price — it’s free! And 
also like many Linux programs, it’s updated constantly. While the basic 
MythTV software is designed solely for DVR TV control functionality, the 
open-source nature of MythTV means that other folks can develop additional 
functionality for the product — and they have, creating plug-ins to do other 
HTPC/media center functions such as photo viewing, music playback, and 
management.
The best place to get more info about MythTV is on the MythTV wiki, at the 
following URL: www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.
By the way, if you’re not familiar with wikis, check out http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/wiki. This site explains the concept and uses of the wiki, which 
is basically an online encyclopedia format that allows multiple users to add 
and edit entries — a community-maintained encyclopedia or data source. 
They can be handy!
Linux MCE to the rescue
An alternative to MythTV comes in the form of Linux MCE (www.linuxMCE.
org), an add-on to the popular Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.org) Linux build (Ubuntu 
is often considered the most “regular person friendly” variant of Linux, with a 
pretty graphical user interface that feels like home to PC and Mac users).
Linux MCE runs on a PC, but the cool thing is that it can run on more than 
one PC in your home. You can install Linux MCE on one central PC (called the 
core) and then run remote instances of it on other PCs throughout the home. 
So you could have a core in your home office and other PCs throughout the 
home that connect to the core over your home network and turn into media 
centers whenever needed. Linux MCE provides the standard audio/video/
PVR functionality you’d expect of any home theater PC but expands beyond 
that to include features such as home automation and control, home server 
functionality — heck it can even act as a phone system.
You can find out all about Linux MCE on its Wiki, located at http://wiki.
linuxmce.org/index.php/Main_Page.

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I’m on Fiire
If you’re not feeling like too much of a do-it-yourselfer but are looking for an 
alternative to Windows Vista and Windows Media Center, consider Fiire. Fiire 
(www.fiire.com) is a company that builds turnkey (as in, bring it home and 
turn the key, it’s ready to go) media center devices based on the Linux MCE 
system.
Fiire offers a number of systems. The core of the system (the core in Linux 
MCE terms) is a honking big PC called the FiireEngine. This system is packed 
with storage (up to 12 terabytes of hard drive space!) and supports audio, 
video, PVR and more. The FiireEngine starts at $1899, and the price goes up 
as you add more storage and features.
If you want one HTPC in your home, you need one FiireEngine. If you want to 
make a whole-home network of the system, you can buy FiireStations (start-
ing at $549). These connect back to the FiireEngine and can be connected 
directly to TVs, home theater audio systems, and the like throughout the 
home.
Finally, Fiire offers a motion-controlled remote control (like the Nintendo Wii 
remote) called the FiireChief. This remote is based on Gyration’s technol-
ogy (www.gyration.com) and lets you point in free space (like a computer 
mouse in the air) to operate your FiireEngine and FiireStations.
 
Gyration also sells similar motion-controlled remote controls for Windows 
Media Center, so if you’re not Linux inclined, you can still get Wii-like control 
of your HTPC.

Accessing Digital Content at Home 
and Over the Internet
In This Chapter
 Understanding Internet-based audio and video content
 Figuring out home broadband network requirements
 Finding content around the house
 Using a Media Center PC to display content
 Using a media adapter to display content
U
ntil recently, most of the content destined for your home theater came 
in the form of DVDs, camcorder tapes, VHS videos, burned MP3s, CDs, 
audio tapes, and other such content in and around the home. Not much of it 
came directly and in real time from Internet sources (except to those of you 
who figured out Napster before it was shut down!).
Soon the Internet will be the main way you get content into your home thea-
ter. Believe us — we do this for a living. You are just seeing the earliest move-
ments toward the flood of Internet content — buying music and TV shows 
from Apple’s iTunes, searching for home videos at YouTube.com, accessing 
streaming video of your local high school basketball team being filmed live 
by students. Video (and other content) will come from everywhere, and the 
vast majority of it will be delivered to your home theater over the Internet.
High-speed Internet connectivity — which again we argue is a baseline 
requirement for any home theater — will enable you to download a lot of 
content for viewing whenever you like. This will put lots of pricing and prod-
uct pressure on cable, satellite, and telephone company TV offerings, and 
that doesn’t bother us a bit!
A large number of diverse players are trying to make Internet-based content 
as easy for you to adopt as finding a sports score or weather forecast on any 

136
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
portal site. Yahoo!, MSN, Google, and others will be trying to convince you to 
search, view, and even buy content through their portals.
Having an Internet-based home theater is step one. After you are plugged in, 
the Web is open to you. You’ll have digital content around your house from 
all over the world to keep you busy at night! Whew, and you thought you 
were going to get some sleep!
Understanding Digital Content 
for Your Home Theater
Grabbing music and video off the Internet is likely not a new topic for you. 
Companies such as Napster and Kazaa started the trend years ago, and 
online music and video stores such as Apple’s iTunes Store are an often-
mentioned item in almost any magazine or newspaper.
But when you get right down to it, a few high-level constructs would be 
good to introduce, so you know what all the fuss is about. Whether it’s on 
a computer hard drive down the hall or on a server in Outer Mongolia, the 
concepts surrounding content are the same. So here’s a quick hit of the key 
concepts we want you to know about electronic content:
 
 File encoding: Digital music and video files are encoded (converted to 
digital formats) using specific encoding formats. For audio, MP3 is most 
common, but many others are out there, including Windows Media 
Audio (WMA), Advanced Audio Code (AAC), and even weirdly named 
ones such as Ogg Vorbis. We discuss these audio formats in detail in 
Chapter 3. Similarly, there are a number of video formats (such as WMV 
and MPEG), discussed in Chapter 4.
 
 The key thing you must keep in mind about the encoding format used 
for your audio or video is that your home theater equipment (be it a 
PC, a media player, or something else entirely) must support the format 
you’re downloading. If it doesn’t, well you’re out of luck. For example, 
if your digital media adapter doesn’t support Apple’s encrypted AAC 
format, you won’t be able to play music from the iTunes Music Store on 
your home theater system. We should note here that Apple is trying to 
get the content owners (the music labels) to let them sell music without 
digital copy protection included in the encrypted version of AAC — the 
less of this DRM (digital rights management) copy protection we’re all 
required to deal with, the better!
 
 Streaming versus downloading: Not all audio or video is delivered in 
the same fashion. In fact, there are two predominant ways of sending the 

137
 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
content: streaming and downloading. Streaming video means that there 
is no local copy of the video on your device. It plays while it is delivered 
over your home network, or the Internet, or both. Many Internet con-
nections aren’t fast enough to play really high-quality streaming video, 
so you find that many Internet movies are downloaded to your machine 
instead. Downloaded video is delivered as a file to be stored inside your 
set-top box, Media Center PC, or other device, and then played back 
from that local storage. So while downloaded video can deliver a TV-like 
quality viewing experience, complete with the ability to fast forward, 
pause, rewind, and so on, you have to wait a while — usually up to an 
hour or more — for full-length movies to download.
 
 Internet radio: Internet radio is exactly what it sounds like — radio sta-
tions broadcasting in a streaming fashion over the Internet. So if you are 
a college student and you miss your favorite radio station back home, 
you can still listen to it via streaming audio over the Internet. We discuss 
Internet radio later in this chapter and briefly in Chapter 5.
 
 Podcasts: Podcasts are the equivalent of downloaded Internet radio. 
These files contain audio (and, more and more, video) that often is 
packaged like daily newscasts or commentary. Podcasts are so-named 
because they initially were targeted toward easy dissemination of con-
tent to iPod users.
 
 Video search: Video search is catching on fast. Video search engines 
scour the Web and find content based on keywords and file formats and 
then make this available through an onscreen interface. Google has per-
haps the best-known search interface at http://video.google.com, 
but there are others, such as Yahoo! (http://video.search.yahoo.
com) and AltaVista (www.altavista.com/video/default). These 
search engines marry the best of non-X-rated amateur videos from the 
Web with the ability to buy videos of TV show series and movies.
 
 Most video search mechanisms today rely on metadata about the 
video — data collected by a person that describes what’s in the video, 
such as subject, actors, directors, file formats, and length. A lot of smart 
folks are looking at ways to have machines do even more classification 
of video content. Eventually these systems will feed into video search 
mechanisms and assist the human-fed metadata search elements (which 
are often incomplete or unreliable). We can’t wait!
 
 File sharing: File-sharing networks are networks set up for, not sur-
prisingly, sharing files. In a very “free love” approach to content, early 
file-sharing networks adopted a “What’s mine is yours, and vice versa” 
approach toward exchanging content. Basically, you were encouraged 
to make your music available to anyone who wanted it, and they would 
do the same with you. Napster, Grokster, and other early leaders in this 
space were taken to court by the music industry, proven to be in 

138
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
violation of Federal copyright laws in the United States, and shut down. 
Most of the large, worldwide music-sharing services used peer-to-peer 
technologies, described next.
 
 Peer-to-peer: Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a concept often associated with music 
file sharing because it is the way most of the illegal music download 
services worked. Peer-to-peer simply means that you directly connect to 
other people’s computers to download files, instead of going to a central 
file server. See, not only are central file servers expensive and require 
a lot of costly broadband bandwidth to support music and video down-
loading, they’re also easy to find and shut down.
 
 Peer-to-peer networks operate without such central control and allow 
multiple users to share files at the same time — you’ll often be down-
loading and uploading different “chunks” of a file to and from numerous 
folks at the same time. Peer-to-peer is not just used for file sharing — 
you also probably use it for some instant messaging services, too.
 
 Digital rights management (DRM): No initials in your Home Theater 
Glossary (you keep it under your pillow, don’t you?) are more accursed 
than DRM — digital rights management. If you download a lot of iTunes 
songs, you’ve run into DRM restrictions when trying to load your songs 
to other devices. (Most portable music players — besides the iPod — 
can’t play back iTunes Music Store downloads.) If you’ve ever tried to 
copy a DVD, you’ve encountered DRM. DRM is everywhere you don’t 
want it to be.
 
 To be fair, DRM exists for a reason — to protect the copyright inter-
ests of the music, movie, and other content owners. Managing who has 
rights to do what with which digital assets is a key function of any DRM 
system.
 
 DRM is often in the news, but you may not hear it referenced as such. 
Back in 2006, when you saw all the hubbub over Sony putting DRM soft-
ware on their CDs to protect against unauthorized copying — software 
that was resident in a PC’s rootkit — that was a DRM issue. (Though the 
issue itself wasn’t the activity of the DRM system, but rather the “secret” 
software that the CD installed onto people’s hard drives.)
 
 The rules for sharing content are defined both technically and legally. 
You can do a lot of stuff technically — that does not make it legal. You 
can safely assume that the law says you can’t copy anything unless you 
are told you explicitly can. You also can pretty much assume you cannot 
rebroadcast or retransmit the content in any way. Indeed, some analysts 
question whether the Slingbox, mentioned later in this chapter (it’s a 
device that sends your home theater TV signals across the Internet to 
your laptop or mobile phone), violates copyright rules by retransmitting 
the signals received by your set-top box.

139
 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
 
 But we did say that part of sharing content is defined technically. This 
is true. In many instances, you cannot record or copy content because 
special coding in the content itself prevents you from doing this.
 
 Some of the music services explicitly allow you to make one copy, or 
play the songs on up to five machines, or some such limitation. This 
will be part of your subscription contract and should be obvious. For 
instance, if you download content from iTunes, you can house that con-
tent on up to five computers (and an unlimited number of iPods). Look 
for this when trying to decide which service to use.
 
 We specifically talk about DRM issues throughout this book as we 
encounter DRM problems. For the sake of this chapter, know that much 
of the Internet content you download will have strong limits on where 
you can put it, and you will most likely be able to view or listen to the 
content only on the machine to which you download the content.
 
Over the past few years, DRM restrictions have loosened up on music, to 
some small degree. For example, as we mentioned earlier in the chapter, 
Apple has been able to offer some of its music without any DRM (this music is 
called iTunes Plus), and the company has publicly stated that it wishes to do 
the same with all the music in the iTunes store. Emusic.com, another popular 
online music store, has always been DRM-free (though it doesn’t offer as much 
mainstream music as does Apple). Amazon.com has launched its own MP3 
music store, also DRM-free. So the DRM situation is getting a bit better in the 
music world.
In the video world, no such luck. Except for the mainly amateur short clips 
offered on sites such as YouTube.com, you’ll find that essentially all video 
content available online is heavily DRM-protected. What this means to you 
is that you can watch content (free or paid subscription content) on your PC 
or in your home theater, but can’t do much else with it. In most cases, you 
can’t save it (if it’s streaming content), burn it onto a DVD, or share it. The 
DRM implementation of the video content provides a specific list of ways in 
which the content can be used, and (for the most part) there are few ways 
of getting around those restrictions. Our advice is to read the fine print — if 
the content you want to watch is, for example, restricted to streaming using 
only Microsoft’s DRM system, you’ll need a PC or other device in your home 
theater that can handle that.
 
Right now, no single device can handle all online audio and video content 
available to you and your home theater. A PC probably comes closest, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 9, but that approach is expensive and a bit of work to get 
into your home theater. And even with a PC you won’t be able to access every-
thing that’s available online. Our recommendation is to look at the content 
sources online that best fit your needs and then look at devices that support 
that content.

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Gauging Your Network Requirements
Figuring out digital content’s impact on your computing and network require-
ments is a lot like trying to figure out how much space you need in your living 
room for books. There are big books, small books, fat books, thin books. 
Music, videos, and even pictures, are a little more predictable than book 
sizes because of the following:
 
 You can usually decide the quality of the content recording you are 
obtaining or making.
 
 You can determine how long you want to have the content.
 
 You can determine when you want to have it.
It goes without saying that if you want to download the biggest movie at the 
best quality and you want to keep it stored on your hard drive (you just love 
those high-definition mini-series don’t ya!) and you want it now, you’re going 
to need a lot more capacity than someone who merely wants to stream a 
movie to his or her small TV set in average-quality mode and be done with it.
Figuring out the basics
You’ll hear companies talk about the number of songs or movies you can 
store on their MP3 players and other digital content media. To make these 
statements, the manufacturers have to make an assumption about your 
encoding format, and they will generally assume a lower-quality format to 
boost the number of songs they can brag can fit on their devices!
 
 For music, 384 Kbps encoding is very high quality to most people, and 
that implies that you can fit about 6,600 songs onto an 80GB hard drive.
 
 Many folks encode their songs at lower bit rates, such as 192 Kbps or 
even 128 Kbps, allowing even more songs to fit on the drive. You’ll have 
to make your own judgment about quality versus space. We think 384 
Kbps is a good balance between audio quality and storage space; you 
may be happier with a higher or lower bit rate.
 
 For video, near-DVD quality is about 1.5 Mbps bit rate and full DVD qual-
ity is about 4 Mbps. At these bit rates, you can fit about 130 or so near-
DVD-quality movies on a 250GB hard drive, or about 50 full-DVD-quality 
movies on the same size drive.
 
 For photos, a high-resolution photo is about 2.5MB. You can fit about 
30,000 pictures onto an 80GB hard drive.

 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
 
 If you’re going to be streaming a lot of content from the Internet, we 
think you should have at least a 4 Mbps download speed from your 
broadband access service — though you can get by with less if you’re 
going to forgo trying to stream high-definition content.
Broadband access into your home is typically asymmetrical, meaning that 
your download speeds are different — and almost always higher — than your 
upload speeds. The nature of the Internet has been that you ask for something, 
be it a Web page or anything else, and you get it. The size of your question 
uploaded to the Internet (a few bytes worth of “Show me www.dummies.
com”) and the size of the file downloaded in response (all the files that con-
stitute the whole Web page) are drastically different, and the broadband 
network technologies were skewed toward larger download speeds for this 
reason.
 
While truly high-speed Internet connections (such as the fiber-optic connec-
tions offered by Verizon’s FiOS service) can theoretically support streaming 
of full bit rate (approximately 20 Mbps) high-definition programming, you 
won’t typically find any online sources of streaming video that use this much 
bandwidth. Most streaming providers use significant amounts of video com-
pression to make their programming fit onto standard broadband connections 
with download speeds of 10 Mbps or less. Download video sources similarly 
will compress their files to lessen the amount of time it takes to download a 
movie or show.
Checking your in-home capabilities
In addition to the capabilities of your PC and of your Internet connection, you 
need to concern yourself with the capabilities of your in-home network con-
nections — the wired or wireless networks that carry content between your 
broadband modem, your computers, and your home theater and networked 
source devices in the home theater.
The size of the network within your home is not as asymmetrical, and files 
are flying all over the place between computers, your modems, printers, 
scanners, cameras, and so on. So your home’s computer network is consid-
ered symmetrical and is designed out of the box as such. Thus, you see home 
networking measured in terms of overall bidirectional capacity at any one 
time, such as 10 Mbps. We discuss home networking for your home theater in 
detail in Chapter 18.

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Making Your Content Digital
Although you can obtain a lot of cool digital content for your home theater 
from the Internet and online services and stores, you’ll probably find that a 
good deal of things you’d like to display in your home theater comes from 
sources inside your home. You probably already have collections of movies, 
songs, and photographs that are not digital, but that you’d like to display in 
your theater. There’s nothing wrong with using analog source devices (such 
as VCRs, cassette decks, and turntables) to get this content into your home 
theater, but many folks like to go all digital.
Why is this the case? Well, first, digital media is typically more durable than 
analog media. LP records scratch and tapes break and wear out, but digital 
files can be played over and over without any degradation. Second, digital 
media is physically space efficient — you can cram a lot of video, music, 
and photos onto a small computer hard drive and then put the bulky tapes, 
records, and cassettes away in the attic. Finally, digital media is more conve-
nient — instead of pulling out a tape (for example), you can simply browse 
for that video on a computer interface and instantly start playing it (and 
pause, rewind, and skip around more easily, too!).
If your content is not yet digitized — for instance, it’s still on VHS tapes, 
paper photographs, photo negatives, cassette tapes, and so on — you might 
want to digitize it.
There’s an art and a process to getting your content digitized and putting it 
on your network — much more than we can cover in this one book. But in a 
nutshell, here are some options to consider:
 
 Photos: Although you can use any scanner to scan your photos into 
an electronic file, we recommend that you use a scanner designed to 
scan old photos and negatives. Most of the experts we know in this area 
point to Nikon’s CoolScan family of slide and film scanners (http://
nikonimaging.com/global/products/scanner/index.htm, 
$500–$2,000). You feed your negatives and slides into the scanner, and 
the system converts them into digital files. You will have to spend time 
reviewing the output, but with Nikon’s raved-about software, the fixes 
made for dust and scratches are amazing. You can get cheaper scanners, 
but you get what you pay for. We advise you to spend the money and get 
the best you can get — there’s a reason you are scanning all these pic-
tures to begin with, so do it right.
 
 If you’ve moved on from film to digital cameras, you may not have a 
long-term justification for getting a film scanner — your new pictures 
will already be digital. In this case, it makes sense to consider using one 
of the myriad of film-scanning services. These services will charge you 
a fee to scan all your pictures. Many will have you physically mail them 
your film, and they then scan it and present it online for your review. 

143
 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
You choose only the pictures that you want (typically there will be a 
minimum — for example, you have to buy 50 percent or more of the 
scans) so you don’t end up paying for scans of those pictures where you 
had your thumb over the lens.
 
 Movies: If you have shelves of VHS home movies you need to convert to 
DVD, doing so is a straightforward and simple process. Unless you want to 
pay a lot of money for an all-in-one conversion device, you can get by with 
a PC, a VCR, a device that converts the VCR’s analog signals into digital, 
and some editing software to make sure everything is just right. Pinnacle 
Systems (www.pinnaclesys.com, $50–$130) offers an easy-to-use range 
of products just for transferring tapes. Its top-of-the-line Digital Video 
Creator 150 ($130) comes with the hardware and software to do the con-
version. (The cable has RCA jacks on one end for connecting to your VCR 
and a USB 2.0 jack on other for connecting to your PC.) If you don’t have a 
DVD burner in your home theater, you can get an add-on burner that will 
connect to your PC starting around $75 at any PC store.
 
 Mac users might consider El Gato’s EyeTV system, which does most of 
the same things that Digital Video Creator 150 does, only on the Apple 
Mac OS. Check it out at www.elgato.com.
 
 Music: If you have shoeboxes full of old cassettes and peach crates full 
of vinyl LPs, these too can be converted to digital. You don’t need any 
special hardware — just your old turntable or tape player. Grab a cable 
with two RCA plugs at one end and a mini 
1⁄8-inch stereo plug at the 
other, which you can get at RadioShack. Connect the RCA plugs to the 
Tape Out jacks on your preamplifier or receiver and connect the other 
end to the Line In jack on your PC sound card. Then you load equaliza-
tion/sound processing software, such as Nero 7 Ultra Edition (www.
nero.com, $80), turn on your source player, and the software will clean 
up your vinyl and cassette recordings, lifting out any annoying scratches 
and pops along the way. If you want, it will break the long taped record-
ing into smaller music files so you can have each song isolated on the 
CD. When it’s ready, it will help you burn the results to CD. If you have a 
LightScribe burner, it will even help you label the CD. (See the “Burning 
labels onto your discs in your PC!” sidebar.). An option for folks with 
milk crates full of old LPs (and no tapes) is to invest in the ION TTUSB 
(www.ion-audio.com, $149). This is an actual turntable (with all of the 
equalization/processing software built in) that plugs in to your PCs USB 
port and converts vinyl to MP3.
If your content is already digital — on mini-DV tapes in a FireWire-accessible 
camcorder, in a Wi-Fi outfitted digital camera, on secure digital (SD) storage 
cards from your cell phone camera, digital camera, or video camera, or some-
thing similar — getting it into your home theater merely involves a simple file 
transfer.

144
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
If you don’t have an SD (or other digital card) reader in your home theater, 
get a universal or all-in-one card reader device that can access a wide range 
of memory cards and process them into your home theater gear. Transferring 
files directly off your digital devices really eats into the battery charge, which 
in turn, over time, reduces the life of the battery unnecessarily. Just pop out 
the card and stick it in these readers, and your files automatically transfer to 
the reader’s parent device. If you get devices with a USB connection, make sure 
it supports the faster USB 2.0 high-speed version. Dazzle’s Cameramate 10-in-1 
Memory Card Reader/Writer (widely available online for under $20) is a great 
example: It reads the ten most popular memory cards from one device. That 
should cover all your memory card–outfitted digital devices in your home.
When it comes to getting camcorder movies into your home theater, check 
out Microsoft’s Movie Maker software, which resides on most Windows XP 
and Vista PCs. (If by chance your PC lacks a copy, you can download it for 
free from the Microsoft site at www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/
moviemaker/default.mspx.) This will help you get your movie onto your 
PC, where you can add music, move scenes around, and add onscreen text. A 
bit too techie for you? Then consider Muvee’s Reveal software (www.muvee.
com, $99). With Reveal, you select your video file, plus the music you like and 
style of movie you want to create, and press a button — Reveal will create 
the movie for you. It selects the scenes with the most apparent action and 
best shots and dubs in the music, resulting in a more concise view of your 
hours of home film footage. Your neighbors and friends will thank you. If 
you have a Mac running OS X, you can use Apple’s iMovie software. It’s stan-
dard on most new Macs, or you can buy it as part of the Apple iLife software 
bundle (www.apple.com/ilife). It’s considered by many to be the easiest-
to-use movie-making software system, but this ease of use doesn’t come 
at the expense of capabilities. (It has all the features most nonprofessional 
movie makers need, and works well with Apple’s iDVD software to create 
DVD movies you can bring with you.)
Burning labels onto your discs in your PC!
You might encounter a cool new technol-
ogy when shopping for a CD or DVD burner. 
LightScribe Direct Disc Labeling enables 
you to burn professional, silkscreen-quality 
labels directly on your CDs and DVDs — if 
you have a LightScribe-enabled optical disc 
drive and LightScribe-compatible media. With 
LightScribe, you create or download the label 
of your choice. Then, after you burn your data, 
music, or video onto a CD or DVD, simply flip the 
disc over, put it back into the drive, and burn 
your newly created label design directly onto 
the disc. It looks professional and way cool. 
Look for LightScribe when buying a burner.
You can save a few bucks (and get results 
almost as good as LightScribe) by combining 
“printable” CDs and DVDs (look on the label 
when you buy) with a printer such as Epson’s 
$99 R280 — this combination lets you pop the 
disc right into a slot on the printer to create 
high-quality labels using the inkjet printer.

 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
Finding Sources of Content Online
Finding online digital content can be hard if you don’t know where to look. 
Thousands of radio stations broadcast over the Internet, for instance. Most 
mainstream FM stations also simulcast over the Internet. On the video side, 
CNN, MSNBC, Yahoo!, and others offer lots of Internet video content; Google’s 
video search capability gives surfers access to amateur video as well as 
Hollywood fare. Content is simply all over the place.
Lucky for you, lots of industry players have stepped up to the challenge of 
organizing all of this content for you through content portals.
When it comes to buying or accessing online content, there are three main 
forms of content services:
 
 Download: You download a file, and it’s yours to use forever. Music 
downloads tend to be in this category. Downloads may be free or not.
 
 Rental: You download a file, and it’s yours to use for a limited time. 
Many movie rentals allow you a certain number of days to view the 
movie before it expires and is no longer viewable. Rentals are usually 
paid for, but can be free on promotion.
 
 Most video rentals have two time restrictions. The first, as we just men-
tioned, is how long you can keep the file on your hard drive before it is 
disabled — this is usually a week or two. The second clock starts when 
you begin watching the video — you typically have 24 hours (on the 
clock) from starting the video for the first time before it expires.
 
 Subscription: You subscribe to a service that gives you access to 
unlimited use of the content as it is presented on the portal, such as 
subscribing to 120 channels of streaming audio for a monthly fee.
In this section, we’ll look at a few of these portals offering downloads, rentals, 
and subscriptions for audio and video content.
Audio content
Audio preceded video in terms of portals on the Internet, largely because 
audio could be listened to via dial-up Internet connections because of the 
much smaller file sizes relative to video. Video had to wait for mass broad-
band deployment to really take off. Some of the most popular online audio 
content providers (with Web addresses conveniently appended) follow:
 
 Apple’s iTunes Music Store (www.apple.com/itunes)
 
 Rhapsody (www.rhapsody.com)
 
 eMusic (www.emusic.com)

146
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 Amazon.com (www.amazon.com/mp3)
 
 Napster (www.napster.com)
The pricing and options for these services change rapidly, and we’d be 
doing both you and us a disservice if we tried to describe all these services 
in detail. Instead, we’ll give you advice about how to find the best service to 
match your needs:
 
 Number of songs: The bigger services offer more choices — it’s as simple 
as that. If you are concerned about the variety and depth of content, you 
should be aware that there is a big variance in the number of songs — 
and the number of songs from high-profile artists — each service makes 
available. Big services such as iTunes, Rhapsody, and Amazon.com’s MP3 
store have many millions of titles. In general, the wider your tastes, the 
more you want to go with the larger services. But smaller services such as 
eMusic (which isn’t exactly tiny, with more than 3.5 million tracks avail-
able) have a lot of interesting music too — and may offer independently 
produced content that the big guys don’t have.
 
 Flexibility in use: If you want to own all your own tracks and movies 
and have no problem limiting your player choice to iPod models, iTunes 
is a great option for you. It’s simple, has an extensive catalog, is leading 
the pack with video purchase options, and allows things such as shar-
ing over your LAN and on multiple PCs. The downside of iTunes is that 
you are married for life to the proprietary Apple world, and that world, 
as of the time of this writing, is very closed. You simply can’t play your 
iTunes-purchased music or video on alternate players, set-top boxes, 
and so on — only Apple’s own Airport Express will play iTunes Music 
Store–purchased songs remotely. On the other hand, if you go with the 
more widely accessible Microsoft Windows Media Audio–based systems, 
you open up your entire home to a range of players, set-top boxes, and 
other platforms to access your digital content. The most flexible, for 
music at least, are Amazon.com and eMusic, which do not use any sort 
of DRM (discussed earlier in the chapter) system, so you can use them 
on anything that plays the MP3 format.
 
 Quality desired: Digital content has a range of quality as well, mostly 
based on the encoding sampling rate used. None of the online digital 
content services store content in a lossless fashion, so all of them end 
up compromising the original recordings to some extent. You can truly 
notice a difference between tracks encoded at 128 Kbps, 160 Kbps, and 
192 Kbps, for instance. (The higher the number, the better the quality, 
for those keeping track.) You do trade off the amount of music you can 
store on your player, though, because the file sizes are larger for higher 
sampling rates. But we think going for the higher sampling rate — 192 
Kbps — is the appropriate trade-off.

147
 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
 
 Try before you buy: If you like to try out lots of new bands and watch all 
the new indie movies, you should look at subscription services because 
you can listen and watch to your heart’s content and buy what you like. 
If you go the download route, you’ll buy a lot of content you end up not 
liking — and that’s simply a waste of money. (You could buy more of our 
books with all that wasted money.) Of the subscription services, we like 
Rhapsody the most because of its user interface.
 
 “On the go” services: If you are constantly downloading your content 
and then hitting the road, you need to look at the available to-go ser-
vices, such as Napster To Go and Rhapsody To Go, which take their 
subscription services and package them for road warriors. For about 
the cost of a CD each month, you can grab your music player, download 
anything in their full catalog, and hit the road. That’s well worth it in our 
book. Only specific music and video players are supported, so check 
their sites.
We’re not so sure you can make much of a decision based on sheer numbers — 
if you care about certain types of music or specific artists, avail yourself of 
the free trials and check them out.
Some services limit access to downloaded content to a specific number of 
computers, often called authorized computers. Be sure to understand where 
you can play your downloaded content because there usually are lots of 
restrictions.
If you like audio books, check out www.audible.com for audio content you 
can download to your portable music player to hear your latest book on tape. 
Also, if you like Internet radio, be sure to check out the following Internet 
radio hosting or search sites for cool stations:
 
 SHOUTcast: www.shoutcast.com
 
 Live365: www.live365.com
 
 Radio-Locator: www.radio-locator.com
Pat’s favorite Internet-only radio station is Radio Paradise (www.radio
paradise.com). You should check it out!
Video content
Many audio portals and services are getting into the movie act as well. Danny 
downloaded the first eight episodes of the second season of Lost from iTunes 
to catch up on what he’d missed. Some of the most popular online video 
sources (again, with handy Web addresses appended) follow:

148
Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 Movielink (www.movielink.com)
 
 CinemaNow (www.cinemanow.com)
 
 Vongo (www.vongo.com)
 
 Hulu (www.hulu.com)
 
 Netflix (www.netflix.com) — yup, the folks who mail red envelopes 
containing DVDs also have online movie viewing options.
 
 Apple iTunes Music Store (www.apple.com/itunes) — yes, it has 
video, too!
The video search engines we discussed earlier in the chapter (such as 
Google’s and Yahoo!’s) can also be great sources of downloadable or stream-
ing video content.
Video services change quickly as well. When looking at video services, you 
come up against some of the same issues you see with audio services:
 
 Content: Not all video services have the same content. As we write, 
iTunes has some TV shows and movie sales and rentals. CinemaNow 
and MovieLink focus on Hollywood movie fare. Over time, all of these 
players will move toward offering the same lineup of video content, with 
probably some exclusive showings here and there. But if you want to 
catch up on old TV shows (Danny really wants to watch the Rome series 
he missed), look specifically for such offers.
 
 Subscriptions versus downloads: For the most part, Internet-based 
video is offered as pay-as-you-go downloads. But some services, such 
as iTunes, have subscription-based services for certain types of content 
(such as a season of a TV series). And Netflix lets you stream an unlim-
ited number of movies — right to your TV — with its new Netflix Player 
by Roku, discussed later in the chapter.
 
 Terms of use: Some video download services let you watch a show 
once. Some let you start and stop it as often as you want, but you have 
to finish within three days. Some let you keep it forever. The models are 
all over the place. Be sure to check out what you are buying. The price 
might be the same, but the terms could be very different.
Video content is a developing market, and lots of the involved players are 
trying to figure it out. Video is starting to take up more and more traffic on 
the networks, and at some point, there will be internal pressures on cable 
and telephone companies to put limits on their unlimited broadband Internet 
access subscribers — in other words, they’ll probably figure out a way to 
charge more to users downloading a lot of content from the Internet. Watch 
for announcements along these lines if you are a big video downloader.

149
 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
Using an MCE PC to Access Content
In Chapter 8, we discuss home theater PCs (HTPCs) and Microsoft’s XP or 
Vista Media Center software for your home theater. In this section, we discuss 
how you might use such a PC as a source device in your home theater —
specifically, how you’d use it to access Internet content.
HTPCs are good as an alternative to other home theater source devices — for 
example, as a high-quality way to play back DVDs. But for most folks, they’re 
not worth the trouble just for that purpose. What really makes an HTPC 
useful is its ability to provide a portal to all sorts of great Internet-based con-
tent. Now, if you’re a real PC aficionado, you might build an HTPC just for fun. 
But if you’re like us, you’re going to go down this road only if there’s some-
thing in it for you. There is!
Most HTPCs and Microsoft’s Media Center systems enable users to seek out 
and find all digital content in the home’s network. So it will scan all attached 
computers for songs, videos, photos, and other content and then make it 
available to you in a consolidated portal interface, where you can view photo 
slideshows, watch home movies, or play music from your library.
Microsoft’s Media Center Edition software has a special section for access-
ing Internet content — Internet TV and Online Services sections (in the XP 
version of Media Center this was called Online Spotlight). This area displays 
products and services from Microsoft’s content partners. Some of the part-
ners are ones mentioned earlier in the chapter — CinemaNow, MovieLink, 
and Napster, to name a few — and others are just more products to help with 
digital content, such as Ofoto’s photo-sharing service or ABC’s Enhanced TV 
for interactive entertainment from that network. Selecting any Spotlight part-
ner is as simple as clicking its icon in Media Center and working in its Media 
Center–compatible portal.
While it doesn’t specifically include an exact equivalent, Apple’s Front Row 
software (found on most new Macs including the iMac, the Mac Mini, and the 
latest PowerBooks) will let Mac users gain access to downloaded Internet 
content in their home theater from the Apple iTunes store. And El Gato’s 
EyeHome software/hardware combo (discussed in Chapter 8) provides full 
access to a Web browser on your home theater’s display, meaning you can 
access just about any Internet content through a networked Mac. For more 
details on HTPCs, check out Chapter 9.

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Using a Media Server or Adapter to 
Access Content Online
You don’t have to own a home theater PC to access Internet content — some 
companies make it easy for you to download Internet content to your TV via 
a special unit that you connect to your TV set.
There are two main types of devices on the market:
 
 Media adapters/servers: Media adapters communicate with a PC and 
facilitate the flow of content from and through your Internet-connected 
PC to your home theater.
 
 Standalone devices: Standalone devices connect directly to the Internet 
and do not require an intermediary PC. While they usually can catalogue 
and access PC-stored content, it’s not the main focus of these devices — 
so you don’t need an actively running PC to gain access to Internet con-
tent with standalone devices.
Media adapters and servers
Many leading consumer electronics manufacturers offer media adapters, and 
capabilities and quality can vary substantially among these products. Media 
adapters “adapt” the PC content to the home theater environment, offering 
content to common stereo interfaces such as RCA and digital audio jacks, 
instead of the more computer-oriented USB and Ethernet jacks.
The typical media adapter is wireless, supports 802.11g or n, has video inter-
faces such as HDMI and a remote control, and has an onscreen or LCD inter-
face for selecting the content choices on your linked PC.
The list of media adapter players is long. The following gives you a flavor for 
what’s out there:
 
 Roku Labs SoundBridge: Roku Labs (www.rokulabs.com, $199) make 
some of the sexiest products on the market. Its SoundBridge M1001 
elegantly links your home theater to a remote PC via 802.11g wireless. It 
supports Apple’s Bonjour technology (formerly known as Rendezvous) 
and iTunes, as well as Windows Media Connect, Windows Media Player 
10, and Windows Media DRM 10 — it’s the most compatible music player 
around.

151
 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
 
 Remember, Apple does not allow streaming of its purchased music 
yet (except through its own Airport Express device), so any songs 
bought through iTunes cannot be played through the SoundBridge. But 
SoundBridge does support the AAC format, so that when Apple opens 
this up, Roku will support it — the SoundBridge does support any music 
that you’ve imported (ripped) into iTunes on your own.
 
 Squeezebox: Mama’s got a Squeezebox, and it’s made by Logitech’s 
Slim Devices division (www.slimdevices.com, $249). The Squeezebox 
Classic has standard analog as well as digital optical and coax outputs, 
so you can link this to your stereo directly with high-quality inputs if 
you like. The Squeezebox has “always-on” Internet Radio, powered by 
its own SqueezeNetwork, that lets you tune in to Internet radio streams 
even when the home PC is switched off. It features Ethernet and 802.11g 
connections. Overall, very nice. Roku also offers a new whole-home 
audio player called the Squeezebox Duet ($399) that can bring music to 
multiple rooms and includes an LCD screen–equipped remote control 
that shows your entire music library right on the remote.
 
 Apple AirPort Express: Aside from being one of only two devices we 
know of that can stream Apple songs purchased in the iTunes Music 
Store (the other is Apple’s AppleTV), the AirPort Express (www.apple.
com, $99) is a small, funky little device that serves multiple roles: media 
adapter, travel router, print server, Wi-Fi repeater, and more. You don’t 
get a remote control, LCD, or onscreen display. For that, you’ll want 
to upgrade to the $229 Apple TV discussed in the “Standalone media 
devices” section.
 
 Other media adapters: Media adapters are all over the place and 
include the following
 
• D-Link’s MediaLounge products (www.dlink.com, $150–$229), 
including the DSM-520 Wireless HD Media Player and the DSM-120 
Wireless Music Player
 
• Netgear’s Wireless Digital Media Players (www.netgear.com, 
$199–$349), including the high-definition capable EVA8000 Digital 
Entertainer HD
 
• Linksys’s wireless entertainment products (www.linksys.com, 
$89 and up), including the WMB54G Wireless-G Music Bridge and a 
pair of Windows Media Center extenders (discussed in the “Extend 
your Media Center PC” sidebar.)

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
Standalone media devices
Whereas media adapters were first out of the gate with lots of units, stand-
alone media devices are growing rapidly. Here’s a sampling of what’s on the 
market:
 
 TiVo: While TiVo (www.tivo.com, starts at $149, $299 for the HD ver-
sion) is known for its personal video recording (PVR) functionality, it is 
moving well beyond that space with deals with Yahoo!, Live365, Netflix, 
and others that in aggregate will open up the TiVo box to the whole 
Internet. Under the Netflix deal, for instance, you would not have to wait 
a day to get your disc — it would be downloaded in an hour to your unit. 
With your Live365 subscription, you can access thousands of radio sta-
tions on Live365’s network through your home theater setup without 
even needing a PC.
Extend your Media Center PC
If you have a Media Center PC (using Microsoft’s 
Windows Media Center software on XP or 
Vista), you don’t have to put it right next to your 
home theater. Go ahead, leave the PC in your 
home office and use a Media Center extender. A 
media extender is a specialized media adapter 
that replicates the Media Center interface on 
your TV without requiring the PC to be locally 
connected to your home theater. You can get 
a Media Center Extender in your home theater 
in two ways:
  Get an Xbox 360: Microsoft’s latest gaming 
console includes Media Center extender 
functionality built right in. You don’t need to 
add hardware or software — just connect 
the Xbox 360 to your home network and you 
can access any content (including recorded 
TV) on your Media Center–equipped PC(s). 
That’s simple. (We talk about the Xbox 360 
in Chapter 8.)
  Buy a standalone Media Center Extender: 
Major manufacturers such as Linksys, HP, 
and D-Link sell these devices (prices range 
from about $250 to $350). Media Center 
Extenders include networking capabili-
ties (Ethernet or Wi-Fi), video connec-
tions (including HDMI, in most cases), and 
audio connections (including digital audio 
outputs).
But wait — there’s more (we can never resist a 
Ginsu knife commercial reference). HP (www.
hp.com) sells a line of high-definition LCD 
TVs (HP MediaSmart LCD HDTVs) with the 
Media Center extender built into the television. 
Nothing to add — just make a network connec-
tion to your PC and you’re all set. Pretty neat 
stuff. You can find out a lot more about Media 
Center extenders (including a list of current 
products — more are coming out all the time) 
at www.extenderforwindowsmedia
center.com.

 Roku Netflix Player: The folks at Roku have branched out beyond their 
audio-only Soundbridge players and into the home theater video world 
with the Roku Netflix Player (www.roku.com, $99), shown in Figure 
10-1. This inexpensive player is designed for use with the Netflix video 
rental service (which starts off at about $5 a month). About 10 percent 
of the hundreds of thousands of DVDs available in Netflix’s catalog are 
available also for streaming. If you’re a Netflix customer, you can go to 
Netflix.com now and start streaming movies to your Windows PC. With 
any plan above $9/month, you’re allowed unlimited streaming. With the 
Netflix Player, you can move this capability right into your home thea-
ter. The Netflix Player includes Ethernet and 802.11g capabilities (for 
connecting to your home network and the Internet), and has component 
and HDMI outputs for making a video connection to your HDTV (as well 
as analog and optical digital audio inputs for connecting to your home 
theater receiver).
 
Figure 10-1: 
Netflix 
Player is a 
cheap and 
easy way 
of getting 
Internet-
based 
movies 
into your 
theater.
 
 
 The Netflix Player can access any streaming videos stored in your 
Netflix Queue and displays them on your TV screen almost instantly. As 
we write there are no high-definition movies available through this ser-
vice, but the box is capable of high-definition. You use your PC only to 
select the movies that go in your queue — otherwise the Netflix Player 
is independent of your PC. For $99, it’s a neat way of getting movies into 
your home theater.

Part II: Getting Video and Music into Your Theater: Source Devices 
 
 VUDU: VUDU (www.vudu.com, starting at $299) is a relatively new (but 
up and coming) player in the standalone video player market. Like the 
Netflix Player, it is tied to a specific service (in this case, VUDU’s own 
service) and is a standalone device that doesn’t need to work with your 
PC. A couple of big differences between the Netflix Player and the $299 
VUDU Box (the primary VUDU product — there’s also a $999 VUDU 
XL model for custom installations with systems such as Control4 and 
Crestron): First, VUDU uses a download model rather than streaming 
(VUDU has the first five minutes of about 5000 movies downloaded on 
your hard drive; when you select a movie the remainder is downloaded), 
and second, VUDU offers full 1080p HDTV content (something that we’ll 
eventually see from Netflix).
 
 The VUDU Box has a 250GB hard drive, HDMI and component video 
outputs, and digital audio outputs (both optical and coaxial). These 
attributes combine to give you storage space for about 50 high-definition 
full-length movies and full connectivity to your HDTV and home theater 
receiver.
 
 VUDU works on a rental model, with more than 6000 high-definition 
movies available from the major studios. You pay for each movie indi-
vidually, and once you rent a movie it is stored on your hard drive for 
30 days — once you start watching, you have 24 hours to complete the 
movie.
 
 AppleTV: Like the Apple iTunes store? Want it in your home theater? 
Check out the AppleTV (www.apple.com/appletv, starting at $229), 
which looks a lot like a shrunken down Mac Mini PC. The AppleTV 
comes with a built-in hard disk drive and Ethernet and 802.11n Wi-Fi 
connectivity. It connects to your HDTV with an HDMI connection and 
to your home theater receiver with an optical audio connection. The 
AppleTV can support 720p high-definition video, and the Apple iTunes 
store provides both purchases and rentals (with similar rental terms to 
those offered by VUDU) of Hollywood movies and TV shows. Of course, 
you can also access iTunes music, podcasts, and other content, as well 
as your photo library and YouTube videos. If you’re a Mac fan, we 
recommend that you check out the AppleTV.
Taking Your Video with You
Getting Internet and computer-based content into your home theater is a 
neat trick (and one that we highly recommend you explore). But what’s even 
neater is being able to access your home theater content away from your 
home theater. Imagine watching a show that you’ve recorded on your DVR 
and having to hop on the train to work before it’s over. Well, with the right 
hardware and software, you can take that content with you and watch it on 
a laptop or handheld device wherever you are (as long as you have Internet 
connectivity).

155
 Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet
This is a new area in home theater, and one that still has some bugs to work 
out, both technical and legal — DRM raises its ugly head again! But it’s 
something that you can do today and will become even more common in the 
future. Following are the first few fruits of this new category of home enter-
tainment gear:
 
 TiVo Desktop: If you have a Series 2 or 3 TiVo DVR, you can use the TiVo’s 
Desktop software built into the product to take your recorded shows 
on the road with you. This isn’t an Internet-based product (such as the 
Slingbox, which we discuss next). Instead, it uses your home network to 
transfer recordings from your TiVo to a Windows 2000, XP, or Vista laptop, 
or to an iPod or other PMP (portable media player) before you leave home. 
When the transfer is done, you can use TiVo’s software (a free download 
from TiVo’s Web site) on that device to watch your recorded programs 
whenever and wherever you like. Check out www.tivo.com for more info. 
TiVo Desktop also works with Mac PCs if you have Roxio’s Titanium Toast 
software ($79, http://partner.roxio.com/enu/oem/tivotoast/
default.html). You can find out more about TiVo Desktop at www.tivo.
com/whatistivo/tivois/anywhereyougo/index.html.
 
 Slingbox: The Slingbox AV ($149 list price) is perhaps the coolest thing 
to come along the home theater and Internet pike in many years. It’s a 
funky-looking box that you connect to your home theater and to your 
home network/Internet connection. Slingbox hooks into your TV source 
devices (such as a cable or satellite set-top box, a DVD player, or a DVR) 
and allows you to remotely control, record, and watch video content. 
You can use a Slingbox to tune in to live TV (for example, catch the local 
baseball game while you’re on the road in your broadband-equipped 
hotel room) or to access recorded content on your DVR or DVD player. 
The companion to Slingbox is SlingPlayer software, which resides on a 
Windows 2000 or XP computer and controls the Slingbox and let’s you 
view content across an Internet connection. SlingPlayer optimizes the 
content you’re viewing to the speed of your connection, so if you’re on 
a broadband connection, you can get a high-quality picture. SlingPlayer 
Mobile is also becoming available (from Sling’s Web site for $29.99), and 
it will allow this capability to work on any Windows Mobile device as 
well. Check it out at www.slingbox.com).
 
 Sony LocationFree: Sony’s $249 answer to the Slingbox, the LocationFree 
player performs similar tasks, sending live TV and content from various 
DVRs across an Internet connection to remote PCs. Like the Slingbox, 
LocationFree let’s you access your home TV programming — both live 
broadcasts and shows you’ve recorded on your DVR — from any remote 
location with a broadband Internet connection (such as a hotel or your 
office). The biggest difference between the two is that Sony’s system sup-
ports playing back content on the PSP handheld gaming device (which 
can connect to Wi-Fi wireless networks). As we write, there’s no mobile 
device capability here (beyond the PSP, that is), but we wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see that added over time. You can find out more at http://
products.sel.sony.com/locationfreetv/.

and Control Devices

In this part . . .
Your journey through Home Theater Land continues 
with a look at the heart of your system — the receiver 
and controller devices. We start this part by looking at 
what’s important about these systems in terms of interfaces, 
power levels, multizone capabilities, and so on. We also help 
you decide whether you want an integrated box (a receiver) 
or separate components. We even talk some about power 
amplifiers, which is a topic of conversation that makes lots 
of guys — yes, 99 percent of guys, sorry — very excited.
Then we walk you though a discussion of everything 
you’ve ever wanted to know about speakers, building off 
the surround-sound knowledge from Part I.
The next chapter delves into your TV display options. 
Your home theater’s display often overwhelms the home 
theater with its presence — not to mention that, with dis-
plays that can go to 120 inches and higher, the options 
can get overwhelming. You can go in lots of directions, 
and we talk about choosing an HDTV and making the all-
important choice between LCD and plasma. (Hint: there’s 
no right answer, both are great!)
Then we get to the projectors. We talk about all the latest 
technologies and devices — including all-in-one projec-
tors — and the pros and cons for each. LCD, DLP, LCoS — 
we have all the hot acronyms here.
And then finally we help you make your way through the 
myriad of options for remotely controlling your system.

T
he A/V receiver is the hub of your home theater. It’s the device that has 
both the brains and the brawn to control and drive your home theater 
experience. A growing home theater market, intense competition, and com-
puter industry–like efficiencies at making electronic components have all 
benefited the A/V receiver. It’s no longer a rarefied, esoteric piece of equip-
ment. In fact, you can get a good one for a reasonable price. Understanding 
the lingo and marketing speak and choosing a good one can still be difficult, 
but that’s why you bought this book!
In this chapter, we describe the features and specifications that are impor-
tant to keep in mind as you evaluate A/V receivers. We also talk about a dif-
ferent approach to controlling your system — using separate A/V controllers 
and power amplifier systems.
Digging In to the A/V Receiver
Think of the A/V receiver as the digital and electronic hub of your home 
theater. An A/V receiver does a bunch of things, all in one nice and relatively 
compact package. (It’s sort of the Swiss army knife of the home theater, 

160
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
except you can’t fit one in your pocket.) Among the tasks assigned to the A/V 
receiver are the following:
 
 Connects and switches your audio sources: Every audio source in your 
home theater should connect to your A/V receiver. The preamplifier sec-
tion of the receiver allows you to easily switch to (or select) the audio 
source that you want to listen to.
 
 Connects and switches your video sources: With a few exceptions (which 
we discuss later), all your video source devices are also connected directly 
to the A/V receiver, which is connected in turn to your display device. This 
setup greatly simplifies the selection of video sources when you want to 
play a DVD, a show recorded on a PVR (such as a TiVo), or anything else. 
In most cases, you select what you want to watch on the receiver’s remote 
and don’t have to adjust anything on the display.
 
 Some folks feel that they can get the highest video quality by not connecting 
video sources through the receiver. With the advent of high-quality compo-
nent video and even HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) switching 
(see Chapter 16 for more on these connections), we feel that there’s a lot 
to be gained by switching your video through the receiver, and little, if any, 
degradation in the quality of your video picture.
 
 Tunes in radio programming: Part of the definition of a receiver is that 
it includes a radio tuner so you can tune in PBS or Lil’ Wayne (or what-
ever floats your boat between those two extremes).
 
 A number of A/V receivers include satellite radio receivers for XM 
or Sirius radio (see Chapter 5 for more on this). So if you want to get 
Howard Stern, sports programming, or other satellite-exclusive content, 
you might want to consider getting this capability built in to your A/V 
receiver. However, you’ll have to pay extra for the subscription. If you 
don’t want to pay more but are still interested in “digital” radio, you 
might also look for a receiver that can pick up the new (and free) HD 
Radio format, also discussed in Chapter 5.
 
 Decodes surround-sound formats: The ability to decode analog and 
digital surround-sound formats (we talk about these in Chapter 3) is one 
of two features that distinguish an A/V receiver from a more traditional 
stereo receiver (the plain old stereo you’ve had around for years).
 
 A few receivers now have the ability to decode the Dolby TrueHD and 
DTS Master Audio formats found on some Blu-ray discs.
 
 Amplifies audio signals to drive multiple speakers: Another distin-
guishing characteristic of an A/V receiver is the fact that it contains at 
least five channels of amplification to drive (or provide power to) your 
surround-sound speaker system.

161
 Chapter 11: The Hear t of Your Home Theater: The A/ V Receiver 
 
 Provides the user interface for your home theater: The interface 
includes the receiver’s remote control (or your own favorite remote, as 
we discuss in Chapter 15), the displays on the receiver’s face, and (in 
many cases) an onscreen display on your television. All these elements 
enable you, the human (or your dog, if he’s very talented), to command 
all the electronic components in your home theater.
In the following sections, we discuss each of these A/V receiver responsibili-
ties in more detail.
Counting Inputs
Most people like to ooh and ahh at the bells and whistles — pretty design, 
big macho power ratings, and the like. When evaluating any A/V receiver, 
however, we think a good place to begin is by counting the inputs that let you 
connect source devices to the receiver. After all, if you have a Blu-ray disc 
player, a cassette deck, a satellite receiver, an Apple TV media player, a turn-
table, a PVR (personal video recorder), an Xbox 360, and a VCR, you want to 
hook all these devices into your home theater.
To use all your components, you’d better have enough inputs on the back of 
your receiver. A receiver may have enough power to wake up people across 
town and a design so beautiful that your home theater skeptic spouse begs 
you to buy it, but that beauty won’t do you much good if you have to climb 
behind it and switch wires every time you want to switch sources. So before 
you buy anything, think about the components you have and what you’ll 
soon be getting and make sure the receiver has enough inputs.
 
Most A/V receivers have enough inputs for most people. We don’t want to 
scare you. In fact, most have enough jacks on the back to make your head 
swim. But many inexpensive receivers don’t have enough of the right kind of 
jacks for some folks. This is particularly true for digital audio and video jacks 
but can also be true for analog audio inputs if you’ve decided to go down the 
SACD or DVD-Audio path, which we cover in Chapter 5, and for many Blu-ray 
disc players, which can use analog outputs for their higher-resolution 
surround-sound formats.
Deciphering digital audio inputs
Digital audio inputs (we show examples of these in Chapter 16) on an A/V 
receiver let you connect the audio outputs of DVD players, CD players, 
game consoles, HDTV tuners, Media Center PCs (Chapter 9), digital audio 

162
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
players for MP3 and other computer audio (Chapter 10), and many newer 
digital cable set-top boxes or DSS satellite receivers. Connecting these audio 
sources by using digital inputs (instead of the traditional analog inputs) is 
always a good idea because the digital signals are much less prone to electri-
cal interference than analog signals. A more important consideration is that 
digital inputs are required to get digital surround-sound formats, such as 
Dolby Digital and DTS, into your receiver. (The two-channel analog outputs 
on DVD players and other devices move you down to the lesser Dolby Pro 
Logic surround-sound system. You can’t get digital surround sound from 
these connections.)
 
An exception to this rule involves devices (mainly DVD players) that have a 
built-in Dolby Digital or DTS surround-sound decoder. You can connect these 
to your receiver using analog audio connections, but this may not be the opti-
mal solution for the following reasons:
 
 You need to use six cables instead of one.
 
 You may lose some signal quality due to interference in the analog 
signal.
 
 You need a receiver that has the necessary six analog inputs on the 
back — and even if you have these, they may be “taken up” by the six 
channel outputs of a DVD-Audio or SACD player.
There are two types of digital audio connections (which we discuss in more 
detail in Chapter 16): coaxial and optical. Some high-end audio folks believe 
that coaxial sounds better; it may have a slight sonic benefit, but not so much 
that regular people can tell. Just make sure that you don’t buy a receiver with 
three optical connections and one coaxial connection and then find you have 
three source devices with coaxial connections only. Oops. (If you don’t know 
what these look like, again look in Chapter 16.)
 
One set of digital audio signals won’t be carried over the coaxial or optical 
digital audio inputs we just discussed. These are the newest (and highest qual-
ity) surround-sound signals found on many Blu-ray discs — Dolby’s TrueHD 
and DTS-HD Master Audio. These lossless systems use much more data to 
digitally encode the surround-sound audio — which makes them sound better 
but uses more data bandwidth than these coaxial or optical cables can carry. 
To get these signals into your home theater receiver, you’ll need to use either 
analog cables (as we just discussed — you’ll need as many as eight cables for 
a 7.1-surround signal) or an HDMI connection to your receiver.
That’s right, a third type of digital connection can carry digital audio signals: 
the HDMI connection, which is increasingly used for HDTV tuners/satellite 
receivers and set-top boxes and which is also common in other devices such 
as DVD players (both regular DVD players and Blu-ray disc players, which we 
discuss in Chapter 6) and even in the newest game consoles such as the Xbox 
360 and PlayStation 3. If you use HDMI to connect these devices to your home 

163
 Chapter 11: The Hear t of Your Home Theater: The A/ V Receiver 
theater receiver, you don’t need to use a separate digital audio connection — 
the audio and video are both carried over the HDMI connection.
 
You can still find a number of current model A/V receivers without support for 
HDMI. So if you want to use HDMI to connect your video to your HDTV, you’ll 
run an HDMI cable from your source device directly to the TV, not to the 
receiver. In cases like this, you’ll want to use a coaxial or optical digital audio 
connection to handle the surround-sound connection to your receiver. We dis-
cuss this in more detail in Chapter 17.
The key measurement here is the total number of connections — as long 
as the types of connections match up with your other equipment, which is 
usually not a problem because most source devices have both kinds of con-
nectors on the back. Look again at the devices with digital connections men-
tioned at the beginning of this section. Count how many of those devices with 
digital outputs you have. Do the math. Many inexpensive receivers have only 
three digital inputs (some even fewer). If all you have is a DVD player, you’ll 
be fine. After a few years of home theatering, however, we bet you’ll have 
multiple devices with digital outputs, so plan ahead.
 
It’s not just the number of digital inputs but also the type of inputs. Most A/V 
devices offer both a coaxial and an optical audio output, but some offer only 
one or the other. When you are counting up your digital input requirements, 
make sure that you account for the number of coaxial and optical inputs you 
need and choose a receiver accordingly.
Analyzing analog audio inputs
Now that we spent all that time telling you that digital inputs are so much better 
than analog inputs, why are we emphasizing analog inputs’ importance? Well, 
first of all, they’re not really that awful. We think digital connections are the 
way to go when they’re available, but analog is just fine when it’s all you can 
get. Devices that use analog audio connections include the following:
 
 Older CD players (without a digital output)
 
 External radio tuners
 
 Analog VCRs
 
 Cable set-top and DSS receivers without digital outputs
 
 Cassette recorders
 
 Older game consoles (such as Nintendo 64 and the original PlayStation)
 
 The newest digital audio sources, SACD and DVD-A, which we discuss in 
Chapter 5

164
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
Just about any device that uses a digital audio connection into your receiver — 
discussed in the previous section — can also use analog audio connections. We 
recommend using digital connections to your receiver when they’re available, 
but if they’re not, don’t forget the fact that you can go analog. It may just get that 
piece of gear connected and save the day!
All the devices we mention in this list — except for SACD and DVD-Audio — 
use a simple pair of analog audio connections, one for the left channel and 
one for the right. It’s not hard to figure these out. Just count up your inputs 
on the receiver and count up your devices. The inputs on the receiver are 
labeled, and these labels correspond to the buttons on the front of the con-
sole and on your remote control. It’s always nice if the names on the receiv-
er’s inputs match input names on the device to which you’re connecting the 
receiver, but it’s not essential. It may not even be possible if you have some 
funky device that no one ever thought of when your receiver was designed.
 
The one exception to this flexibility in making connections are the inputs on 
your receiver marked phono. These are for your record player (phonograph) 
and are not standard inputs. If you have a record player, use these inputs for 
it. If you don’t have a record player, don’t use these inputs for anything else. If 
you do use them, it won’t blow anything up, but it will sound amazingly awful, 
and your dog will hide under the bed until you turn it off.
For DVD-Audio and SACD players, you need a special set of analog inputs 
with six connectors. These formats can support multichannel audio (five 
channels plus a subwoofer for bass) and therefore need the extra inputs. 
Many newer receivers have a six-input section (called a 5.1 analog input), so 
you can use an SACD or DVD-A player.
Some receivers also have a section on the back with six (or more!) inputs 
for an external decoder. These allow you to hook up a newer decoder in the 
future. The idea is that the future decoder will handle surround-sound for-
mats that weren’t even thought of when the receiver was designed — a nice 
bit of futureproofing.
 
The 5.1-channel input for DVD-A/SACD and the input for an external decoder 
are functionally identical. Some receivers will have one set of 5.1 inputs 
labeled for DVD-A/SACD and another labeled for an external decoder. Others 
have only one set. In the majority of cases, you can use these inputs for either 
purpose.
Some receivers also have a set of six similar-looking outputs. These allow you 
to bypass the internal amplifiers in the receiver and use a set of separate, 
more powerful amplifiers to drive your speakers. Again, this is a nice feature 
to look for if you think you might need more power some time in the future.

165
 Chapter 11: The Hear t of Your Home Theater: The A/ V Receiver 
Verifying video inputs
When hooking up a home theater, some folks try to connect all their video 
devices directly to the TV or display, but they usually don’t succeed because 
most displays have a rather limited set of inputs on the back (though some 
have a ton). We prefer to connect all our video devices directly to the 
receiver and let the receiver switch (that is, select) which video source goes 
to the display. It’s just easier, neater, and simpler that way.
We’re talking about the video signal coming out of these devices here. They 
all have an audio signal as well (for the soundtrack), and that should also be 
connected to the receiver using one of the two methods described in the pre-
vious sections. You won’t get any surround sound if you don’t perform that 
basic step.
Analog video connections
As we discuss in Chapter 16, there are five common types of video connec-
tions (in order of worst to best): coaxial (also called baseband — rarely 
found in a receiver), composite, S-video, component, and the digital HDMI 
system. Virtually every A/V receiver has yellow color-coded composite video 
inputs on the back. (They’re usually right next to the audio inputs for a 
source device, so they’re labeled DVD, VCR, and so on.) Coaxial is the pits, so 
the less said about it the better. Composite video basically stinks (relative to 
S-video and component), so use it only for low-resolution video sources, such 
as low-end VCRs; otherwise, just leave those composite plugs unused.
What you want to look for in a receiver are both S-video connections and 
component video connections for your analog video sources. The picture 
quality you get when using these connections is almost always better than 
what you get with a composite video connection. S-video connections can 
be found on better VCRs (the S-VHS models), most DVD players, DSS receiv-
ers, digital cable set-top boxes, PVRs, and older gaming consoles (Xbox, 
PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube, for example). Component video con-
nections can be found on DVD players, HDTV tuners, gaming consoles such 
as the PS3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo Wii, and on many PVRs (such as TiVo and 
those built-in to high-definition set-top boxes for cable and satellite TV).
 
HDTV signals need a special kind of component video connection called a 
wideband component video connection. Some receivers have component video 
connections but can’t handle the higher frequencies of HDTV. If a specification 
is given, look for something higher than 25 MHz.
Until recently, component video inputs were a rarity on inexpensive and 
even moderately priced receivers. Because the popularity of DVD and other 
sources that can use component video (particularly HDTV) has risen, 

166
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
however, component video has moved into the mainstream. Even the cheap-
est receivers typically have two or three sets of component video inputs these 
days. If you run a bit short on component video inputs, you can use S-video for 
nonprogressive or non-HDTV sources (such as a PlayStation 2) and reserve the 
component inputs for your progressive-scan DVD and your HDTV tuner.
 
Many otherwise excellent displays have only a single-component video input, 
and few displays have enough S-video inputs for everything you might want 
to connect to them. This is a strong argument for finding a receiver that has 
a sufficient number of inputs. Like the audio inputs discussed earlier, this is a 
pretty simple thing to figure out while you are shopping. Count up what you 
have that uses S-video or component video and start eliminating A/V receivers 
that don’t have what you need from your shopping list.
HDMI hits the receiver
Digital HDMI audio/video connections are used for both audio and video — 
all over a single cable. We talk about HDMI in more detail in Chapter 16, but 
here’s an overview of how HDMI fits into the receiver world.
First, HDMI is still a relatively new technology in the receiver market — it’s 
become pretty much the “go to” video connection technology for HDTVs and 
for high-definition sources feeding into those TVs (such as DVD, Blu-ray disc, 
and set-top boxes). But receiver manufacturers are still slowly incorporating 
the technology into their receivers. Most receivers that cost $500 or more 
have at least a few built-in HDMI inputs (and one HDMI output). Many under 
that price have just component video inputs and no HDMI. Over time, you’ll 
find that HDMI will become standard on just about all receivers, but today 
you’ll probably have to pay more for it.
Because HDMI has become the primary means of connecting high-definition 
source devices, you’ll want to have as many HDMI inputs on your receiver as 
you can. Even expensive receivers often top out at three HDMI inputs (which 
would allow, for example, a Blu-ray disc player, a high-definition gaming 
console, and a TV set-top box to connect through your receiver). It’s rare to 
find any more than that at any price today, though we suspect that receiver 
manufacturers will follow the lead of TV manufacturers (who routinely offer 
four HDMI inputs on their TVs) in the near future.
 
If you don’t have enough HDMI inputs on your receiver, you can use HDMI 
cables to connect some of your sources directly to the TV, and then connect 
the audio outputs of those sources to your receiver using digital audio con-
nections. If you have a Blu-ray disc player in your home theater arsenal, make 
sure you connect it directly to the receiver using HDMI, to ensure that you’ll 
be able to get the highest quality surround-sound audio using DTS-HD Master 
Audio or Dolby True HD.
There’s one small gotcha to keep in mind about HDMI (and we discuss this 
in detail in Chapter 16). HDMI comes in two versions: HDMI and HDMI High 

167
 Chapter 11: The Hear t of Your Home Theater: The A/ V Receiver 
Speed (what folks often call HDMI 1.3). The High Speed version lets you send 
a 1080p video signal over the HDMI connection; the regular version tops out 
at 1080i. This isn’t an issue if you don’t have a 1080p HDTV (see Chapter 13), 
but if you do have 1080p, you’ll want to make sure that anything connected 
via HDMI supports High Speed — if your receiver doesn’t support this, you 
might want to connect any 1080p HDMI sources directly to the TV.
Switching sources
With all these inputs, an A/V receiver can do all the source switching for your 
home theater system. Plug all your source devices in to the receiver, connect 
your speakers and display to the receiver’s outputs, and let the receiver do 
the work of sending audio and video to these devices — rather than having a 
bunch of individual cables running to your display. As we mentioned earlier, 
most displays simply don’t have enough inputs (particularly on the video 
side) to allow you to connect the myriad video sources you have (or will 
soon have) directly into them. Allowing the A/V receiver to concentrate and 
switch between all these sources just plain makes sense.
As you audition receivers, check out the quality of their video switching. 
We can’t give you a quantitative piece of advice here, but we can tell you to 
do some research. Read the reviews. Most good reviewers comment on the 
video-switching capabilities. If you can, do your own quick test. Watch a bit 
of video on a DVD player hooked up through the receiver and then try watch-
ing the same video using the same type of connection plugged directly in to 
the display. If the picture is softer or less detailed when running through the 
receiver, it might not the receiver you want.
Another factor to keep in mind regarding video switching is how the A/V 
receiver itself connects to the display. You’ll likely have a mixture of com-
posite, S-video, and component video connections running into the receiver 
from your source devices. Some more capable receivers convert signals 
from lower-quality to higher-quality connections. For example, a receiver 
may convert all composite and S-video incoming connections to component 
video. This doesn’t make the picture any better, but it does enable you to use 
a single output connection from the receiver to the display. It also enables 
you to set the display on its component input and then just leave it there and 
forget it, which is handy.
 
Many receivers use the home theater display to provide onscreen system 
controls. If your system converts composite or S-video to a higher-quality con-
nection, make sure it also sends the onscreen display over that connection. 
Switching the display back to the composite video input just to tweak a control 
is a real pain in the tonsils (as Pat’s mom says — though he’s not sure what 
that means).

168
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Understanding upconversion
A feature that has hit the market by storm recently (and that we think can be 
handy) is video upconversion. Essentially, a receiver with upconversion takes 
lower-resolution video input (such as composite or S-video) and converts it 
to a higher-resolution format, such as component video or even HDMI.
The two primary reasons to consider video upconversion in a receiver are
 
 Fewer cables
 
 Improved picture quality
You’ll see two types of upconversion when you’re shopping for receivers:
 
 Component upconversion
 
 HDMI upconversion
Uh oh, too few inputs on your receiver?
Sometimes, you do your homework and buy a 
receiver with enough inputs, and then some 
new video source plops into your life unan-
nounced, leaving you an input or two short. (Or 
maybe you just plain fell in love with a receiver 
that didn’t have enough inputs. We forgive you.) 
What to do?
Well, first check your display for extra inputs 
on the back (or front). Using these isn’t quite as 
neat and integrated as using the receiver, but 
doing so won’t hurt the image quality.
If you’re still running short, look into an exter-
nal video switcher. You can get your hands 
on a cheap one at any electronics or home 
theater store. You usually switch this device 
manually (meaning you walk up to it and push a 
button). Switchers accept several video inputs 
and send them to your receiver over a single 
output connection. Many switchers include an 
autoswitching capability (so that the active 
source is sent to your TV, without any action 
from you), which is a very nice feature. At a 
minimum, you’ll want a switcher that can be 
controlled by a remote control — it’s no fun 
to have to get up and push a button to change 
sources — yes, we’ve all been spoiled rotten by 
the remote control.
Most folks these days run out of HDMI inputs 
on their receivers before any other type (as 
more and more sources move to HDMI). A good 
example of an HDMI switcher is Oppo Digital’s 
HM-31 (http://oppodigital.com/
hm31/), which can switch three HDMI inputs 
into one HDMI output cable. For only $99 you 
get HDMI High Speed, capable of supporting 
1080p video and just about anything that HDMI 
is capable of carrying. You don’t get autoswitch-
ing, but the cost is about one-fourth the price of 
most competing solutions.

 Chapter 11: The Hear t of Your Home Theater: The A/ V Receiver 
Assessing Your Amplifier
Another essential job for any A/V receiver involves amplifying outgoing audio 
signals so that your speakers can do their thing. We discuss in greater detail 
how speakers work in the following chapter, but for now let’s just say that they 
are based on electromagnetic systems that need a lot of electricity. The elec-
trical signals coming out of audio source devices, however, are relatively low-
powered. The amplifier does what its name says; it increases this power level.
Unscrambling power ratings
The first thing most folks look at when they see a shiny new receiver is the 
power rating. The rating is measured in watts per channel (usually measured 
as RMS, or root mean square, instead of peak, which means that it is a mea-
sure of sustained power, not the highest possible instantaneous peak). The 
problem is that you can’t take these ratings at face value because manufac-
turers play a lot of interesting tricks when they give these watt ratings. The 
result is that a receiver can be more or less powerful than another receiver 
with the same rating. To get a feel for a receiver’s power, examine the follow-
ing four things closely:
 
 Distortion: Power is measured at a certain number of watts at a certain 
level of distortion (noise created by the amplifier). You want low distor-
tion (of course). The tricky part comes in when you examine how the 
amplifier’s power output is measured — specifically at what distortion 
level it’s measured. An amp that is measured, for example, at 100 watts 
per channel at 0.02 percent THD (total harmonic distortion, the standard 
measurement) is quieter and is probably more powerful than one that 
is measured at 100 watts per channel at 0.2 percent THD. You can do a 
direct comparison only if both are measured at the same THD percent-
age. Another way of looking at this issue is this fact: If manufacturers 
measure power at a higher distortion rating, they can squeeze more “on 
paper” power out of the receiver.
 
 Impedance: Almost all amplifiers are rated at 8 ohms impedance (a mea-
sure of electrical resistance, discussed in Chapter 12), so you can com-
pare ratings this way, but a few are also measured at 6 or even 4 ohms. 
These lower resistances can give an artificially high power rating — be 
suspicious.
 
 Not all amplifiers built into receivers (or even in separate power ampli-
fiers) can power 4-ohm speakers without overheating, popping a circuit 
breaker, or just plain breaking down. Check to see whether a receiver 
can support these lower impedances if you choose speakers that require 
it. This is rare unless you are buying high-end gear — most home theater 

170
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
speaker systems are rated at 8 ohms of impedance (though the actual 
number varies as the speakers reproduce different frequencies).
 
 Frequency range: Lower frequencies (the bass frequencies) require more 
amplifier power than higher frequencies. Because of this, some receiver 
manufacturers test their systems not at the full 20 to 20,000 Hz range 
(which is what we call full range), but with a limited range (such as 40 to 
20,000 Hz). This can also create an artificially high power rating. Receivers 
that are measured at full range are often called full bandwidth rated.
 
 Number of channels driven: Home theater receivers should be capable of 
driving at least five speakers (some have amplifiers for six, seven, or more 
speakers for extra surround channels). Power ratings should state how 
many speakers are being driven when the system is tested. Preferably, all 
channels are driven simultaneously at the stated power. Some systems 
give power ratings in stereo mode (with only the front left and right speak-
ers driven), which means that the power with all speakers being driven is 
less than the stated amount.
Determining how much 
receiver power you need
How much power do you need in your receiver? Well, we’re going to weasel 
out by saying, “It depends.” Which speakers you choose plays a key role 
here. Different speakers have different sensitivities, a measure of how loud 
they are, given a certain amount of power. The standard measure for this is 
how many decibels they produce with 1 watt of power at 1 meter’s distance 
from the speaker. A more sensitive speaker requires less amplification to 
reach the same volume level.
You also need to consider the size of your home theater and how loudly you 
plan on playing your movies and music. If you want to create permanent 
hearing loss or have a room the size of the Taj Mahal, you might need a 
receiver that can pump out 150 watts per channel. If you have relatively sen-
sitive speakers and a moderately sized home theater, and you don’t plan on 
testing the thickness of your window glass with really loud music, a receiver 
with 70 watts per channel (or less) might do the trick. We think that receivers 
with about 100 watts per channel (honestly measured) are more than power-
ful enough in just about any home theater.
 
Amplifiers (whether separate or in a receiver) make their power by using tran-
sistors. In the old days, amplifiers used vacuum tubes, and some really expen-
sive high-end amps still use tubes because some audio enthusiasts prefer their 
sound. Inexpensive receivers use an IC (integrated circuit), which provides 
the power-generating transistors for several audio channels on a single chip. 
Better receivers have discrete amplifier output transistors — separate 
transistors for each channel. Typically, you get more power and better sound 
from a discrete design.

171
 Chapter 11: The Hear t of Your Home Theater: The A/ V Receiver 
Zoning Out to the Rest of the House
Many home theater receivers — particularly those $1,000 or higher — include 
a multizone functionality. This lets your receiver not only control your home 
theater but also provide music to other rooms in your house. A multizone 
receiver is a good way to get started down the whole-home theater path.
The simplest multizone receivers have a pair of stereo audio outputs (not 
speaker connectors or amplifier channels, just outputs). These outputs 
enable you to run an audio cable to another room and connect to a separate 
amplifier and speakers in that room (or to a pair of active speakers that have 
a built-in amplifier). The key feature to look for here is that this second zone 
is truly a second zone. That is to say, the receiver lets you send a different 
audio source to the second room, not just the one you are playing in the 
home theater. So the kids can listen to Barney the dinosaur sing “I love you” 
in the den, while you watch Memento in the home theater.
As you get into more sophisticated systems, you can find receivers with 
extra built-in amplifiers (so you don’t need an amp in the extra room) and 
with extra zones (so you can send different audio sources to a third or fourth 
room). You may even find multizone A/V receivers that send out a composite 
video signal. With this signal, you can watch the video from a home theater 
video source elsewhere in the home.
In Chapter 18, we get into more detail about sharing home theater sources 
throughout the home. If you want to get really sophisticated with a true 
“every room in the house” system, you might need some more gear (which 
we discuss in that chapter).
Having Fun with DSPs and Decoders
Another key responsibility of the A/V receiver is to decode surround-sound 
formats in your audio and video programming so that sound can be sent to 
those six or more speakers in your theater. Two kinds of chips in the receiver 
handle all this digital magic: the DSP and the DAC.
Digital Signal Processors
The DSP (Digital Signal Processor) is the brains of the decoding process. 
This chip handles all the steering of surround sound, sending musical 
signals to the correct channels. The DSP also can provide its own sound field 
enhancements — essentially electronic changes in tone and timing (echoes) — 
though some people hate them and wouldn’t use the term enhancement to 

172
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
describe them! These enhancements are called DSP Modes, which are modi-
fications to the signal to create delays in the sound. The delays can make 
your home theater sound like something else — for example, a cathedral or a 
smoky jazzy club (you have to provide your own smoke).
One feature that DSPs enable (and that we love!) is the ability to dynamically 
compress music and, more importantly, movie soundtracks. Dynamic com-
pression makes the louds less loud and also makes the quiet parts not quite 
so quiet. When someone is sleeping two rooms over while you watch a movie 
at night, you don’t necessarily want that Top Gun F-14 flying overhead at full 
roar. (Pat was in the Navy and spent too much time in the Persian Gulf with 
jets taking off about 15 feet over his head and doesn’t ever want to hear that 
again, but that’s a different story.) This feature, often called nighttime mode, 
is great for family harmony.
 
Many receiver manufacturers make a big deal about which DSP they use. It 
does make a difference, and some aficionados have their own preferences. 
The key is that the DSP can support the decoding of the surround-sound 
formats you want and need in your home theater. At a minimum, you should 
pick a receiver that can decode Dolby Digital and DTS (the plain-Jane 5.1 ver-
sions of these standards) and Dolby Pro Logic II (for VHS and other nondigital 
sources). We like receivers that can also decode Dolby Pro Logic IIx, which 
does a much better job on VHS and regular TV — luckily Pro Logic IIx is 
becoming pretty much standard these days.
If you’re getting a six- or seven-channel system, you want a receiver that can 
support DTS-ES or Dolby Digital EX (or THX Surround EX). We don’t think 
that’s necessary for an entry-level home theater, but if you’re getting fancy, 
why not?
Make your receiver automatic
A cool feature that’s increasingly being built 
into home theater receivers is an autocalibra-
tion system. If you read Chapter 19, you’ll see 
our discussion of receiver calibration, which is 
essentially adjusting the volume and time delay 
of signals sent to each of the speakers in your 
surround-sound system so that your system 
sounds right for your room and speaker place-
ment. This is a painstaking and somewhat inac-
curate process if you do it manually. Luckily, 
many manufacturers now incorporate an auto-
mated system that lets you plug a microphone in 
to your receiver, press a button, and essentially 
walk away while your receiver calibrates itself.
The biggest manufacturer of such software 
systems is Audyssey (www.audyssey.com). 
You can find a description of its MultEQ system, 
along with a list of receivers into which it has 
been incorporated, at the company’s Web site.

173
 Chapter 11: The Hear t of Your Home Theater: The A/ V Receiver 
 
The Blu-ray disc player has brought Dolby’s TrueHD and Digital Plus as well as 
DTS’s DTS-HD Master Audio formats, all discussed in Chapter 3, to the home 
theater. For the most part you’ll find the decoders for these formats inside the 
Blu-ray disc player and not in the receiver, but a number of fancier receivers 
are beginning to include decoders inside the receiver itself. To recap what we 
said in Chapter 6 (where we discuss Blu-ray disc players), you can get these 
high-quality surround-sound formats into your receiver in three ways:
 
 If you have HDMI and a decoder for these formats in your receiver, and 
your Blu-ray player supports it, you can send the TrueHD or Master 
Audio bitstream over HDMI to your receiver, and let the receiver’s inter-
nal decoder handle the surround-sound decoding. This is great, if you 
can do it, but not very common as we write this.
 
 If you have HDMI in your receiver and a decoder in your Blu-ray disc 
player (not in your receiver), you can send the surround sound as PCM 
audio over your HDMI cable. This is just about as good, soundwise, as 
decoding inside the receiver and is much more common.
 
 Finally, if your receiver has no HDMI connection and your Blu-ray disc 
player has a built-in decoder, you can use analog connections for your 
audio. This is less convenient (eight cables for audio plus a video cable 
to your TV), but the quality is also quite good. This is also common.
Digital Analog Converters
DACs (or Digital Analog Converters) take the digitally encoded musical 
signals (from a Dolby Digital or DTS DVD soundtrack or the PCM — short 
for Pulse Code Modulation, a standard way of storing digital audio — from 
a digitally connected compact disc) and convert these digital signals into 
analog signals that the receiver’s amplifier and the speakers can understand. 
Receiver vendors seem to be going through some kind of a race with DACs 
these days. Each vendor is coming out with models that have new DACs with 
even higher capacities.
DACs are rated by the frequency of digital signal and the number of bits they 
can decode (for example, 96 kHz and 24 bits). We’ve seen receivers with 
multiple DACs (up to 16 in a single receiver) rated at 192 kHz and 24 bits. You 
should choose a receiver with at least 96 kHz/24-bit DACs. If digital connec-
tions for systems such as SACD or DVD-Audio ever become common, those 
higher-capacity DACs will become a minimum recommendation. (Today, they 
are not, in our minds.)

174
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Sometimes, you don’t want to mess with all that digital stuff. Analog signals 
coming into the receiver are typically converted to digital signals (using 
ADCs — the opposite of DACs). The digital signals run through the DSP and 
are then converted back to analog signals with the DACs. Many audio purists 
feel that all this conversion can create minor (but to them, not insignificant) 
distortions in the audio. If your receiver has analog bypass, you can stay in 
straight, old-fashioned, pure analog all the way to the amplifier section. We 
recommend analog bypass for the analog inputs from an SACD or a DVD-
Audio player, as well as for turntable inputs. Some receivers automatically 
bypass the digital stuff for these inputs whereas others have a switch on the 
remote. Some don’t bypass it at all; so if you want this feature, check to see if 
your receiver will give it to you.
Dealing with Bass
Connecting a subwoofer (or more than one if you love the bass) to your 
home theater is an essential part of providing the sound for your movies and 
TV. The majority of subwoofers are active (they have their own built-in ampli-
fiers). You need an output on your A/V receiver to connect a standard analog 
audio cable to the subwoofer. On most receivers, this output is labeled the 
LFE (Low Frequency Effects) channel and is indicated by the “.1” part of 5.1-, 
6.1-, and 7.1-channel surround-sound formats. We highly recommend you 
get a receiver with this output; most receivers have one — it’s pretty much 
assured if you buy a Dolby Digital– or DTS-equipped receiver.
The other subwoofer-related thing to look for is an adjustable crossover that 
lets you select which audio frequencies go to the subwoofer and which go 
to the main front speakers. Different speaker systems sound better with the 
crossover set at different frequencies. If you have small bookshelf speakers in 
the front, you might set the crossover to a higher frequency. If you have a set 
of huge tower speakers with giant woofers (bass speakers) of their own, you 
might set the crossover to a lower frequency and let the subwoofer concen-
trate on only the really deep sounds.
We discuss speakers in more detail in Chapter 12.
Interfacing with Your Receiver
A/V receivers control a lot of things in your system, such as selection of 
audio and video sources, volume, surround-sound formats, relative volume 
levels for surround speakers, and more. You interface with the receiver 
through the buttons and knobs on the front and, more importantly, through 
the remote control.

175
 Chapter 11: The Hear t of Your Home Theater: The A/ V Receiver 
The receiver gives you feedback on your control actions through one or both 
of two means: lights and displays on the face of the receiver and an onscreen 
display on your television set. We like onscreen displays (they’re easier to 
read), and we’d be willing to bet you will, too. However, you’re not going to 
find this feature on most inexpensive receivers.
Whether or not you have an onscreen display, we think that checking out 
how the receiver’s interface works is important. For example, most receivers 
use menu-driven controls (like the menus in a computer program). In some 
cases, you need to push a lot of buttons and navigate through several menus 
to get to important controls. That’s okay for things you set once and forget 
about (such as your initial setup), but such controls are a real pain for proce-
dures you do over and over again (such as selecting a video or audio source). 
We like systems that have easy-to-understand menus and direct access to key 
functions (meaning you have to press only one button to get to them).
When evaluating a receiver’s interface, you also want to check out the remote 
control. These days, most A/V receivers can control other devices (such as 
DVD players). Many remotes are learning or programmable ones that can 
control devices from other manufacturers. Cheaper programmable remotes 
work only with equipment from the same manufacturer. When you start 
getting fancy, you find remotes that are backlit (so you can see them in the 
dark) or even touch-screen remotes (with a touch-sensitive LCD panel instead 
of a million tiny little buttons). We talk about remotes in much more detail in 
Chapter 15.
Making the Separates Decision
As you start moving up the price scale, you begin to reach a decision point: 
Do you want to stick with a (very, very good) all-in-one high-end A/V receiver, 
or do you want to move into separates? Separates break down the functions of 
the receiver into three (you guessed it) separate components: a radio tuner, a 
power amplifier (or power amplifiers), and an A/V controller. You can probably 
guess what the tuner and amplifiers do; the controller performs the switching 
and preamplification tasks (basically adjusting the levels of audio signals to 
control your volume) and includes the DSPs and DACs that do surround-sound 
decoding and conversion of digital audio into analog audio.
You might go with separates for a couple of reasons:
 
 More flexibility: A separates system lets you choose exactly which 
components you want. Like the amplifiers from Brand X but the controller 
functions from Brand Y? Mix and match! Separates give you a more flexible 
upgrade path, too. If you buy a Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 decoder but 

176
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
someday want to move up to Dolby Digital Plus (or some future sur-
round-sound format), you need to upgrade only the decoder, not the 
whole system. Keep in mind that you might have to buy extra amplifiers 
for extra surround-sound channels, but that’s easy to do.
 
 Better performance: A/V receivers can offer excellent sound quality, but 
for that last bit of sonic realism, separates can offer the ultimate in sound. 
Putting all the electronics for your A/V components in separate chassis can 
reduce the possibility of these electronic gizmos interfering with each other 
and causing distortions in your sound. For example, many folks going the 
separates route buy fancy mono power amplifiers — a separate amplifier 
(with its own power supply and other internal components) for each chan-
nel. Most people don’t have the space, budget, or (to be realistic) the need 
for such a setup. But it’s a nice possibility to consider.
We talk about separate components in more detail in Chapter 21, where we 
describe moving up to the high end of home theater. If you can afford the 
additional expense, you might want to consider using separates. If you don’t 
want to spend any more than you have to and prefer the simplicity (and 
space savings) of an all-in-one solution, stick with an A/V receiver.

lthough your video display often hogs all the attention in your home 
theater, the speaker system is what really makes your theater sing — 
literally.
Speaker systems don’t get the attention they deserve. Many people actually 
see the speaker system as almost an afterthought — something bundled with 
the receiver or other equipment. Speakers have a double curse: They lack 
oodles of fancy features and display screens, and the features they do have 
are tied up with technical descriptions that most people can’t decipher.
Not paying enough attention to your speaker system is a huge mistake. 
People notice bad audio a lot faster than they notice bad video. In this chap-
ter, we explain how to evaluate your speakers, and we discuss issues to think 
about when buying speakers for your home theater. In Chapters 17 and 19, 
we talk about how to install your speakers and tweak them to perfection.
Understanding How Speakers Work
Unlike other components in your system, speakers are differentiated (more 
than anything else) by somewhat obscure technical characteristics. So an 
understanding of how speakers work may be just what you need to stay un-
glassy-eyed when we go on and on about making sure your speakers are in 
phase and things like that.

178
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Drivers
Speakers are actually relatively simple devices. Basically, you have an enclo-
sure (typically a box) into which speaker drivers are attached. The drivers 
are the round elements that many people call the speakers (they’re not). 
The drivers look like cones or horns (or even ribbons or domes), and in fact, 
the large surface area of the drivers is called the cone or diaphragm. These 
surfaces move back and forth to make the sound. If you have ever pulled the 
front screen off your speakers or have seen speakers without their front grille 
on, you’ve seen speaker drivers au naturelle.
Driver sizes
Drivers come in different sizes and modes, but generally speaking, you’ll find 
three types, based on the frequencies they handle:
 
 Tweeter driver: These handle the high-frequency treble range (above 
2000 Hz).
 
 Midrange driver: These, not surprisingly, handle midrange frequencies 
(200 Hz to 2000 Hz).
 
 Woofer driver: These handle the low-frequency bass range (below 200 Hz).
No single driver is well suited to handle all sounds from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz; mul-
tiple drivers are commonly used to be able to span the full spectrum. A speaker 
that handles the full frequency is called, not surprisingly, a full-range speaker.
How drivers work
 
Speaker driver cones are typically made from paper, plastic, or metal. This 
material moves back and forth and creates changes in the air pressure (sound 
waves) that ultimately arrive at your eardrum and cause it to move back and 
forth in a corresponding fashion. This causes you to hear the sound. The cone 
is moved by an electromagnetic process that’s caused by a coil of wire, called 
the voice coil, at the base of the cone. The electrical impulses coming from the 
amplifier (or the amplifiers built into your receiver) drive the voice coil, and 
the voice coil interacts with a permanent magnet attached to the speaker’s 
cone or dome or whatever shape it may take. (If you want a great explanation 
of how speakers work in more detail, check out www.howstuffworks.com/
speaker.htm.)
Drivers come in all sorts of different sizes, but (again) generally speaking, 
the larger the driver, the lower the frequencies it was designed for. Because 
higher frequencies require sound waves that have high and low pressure 
points close together, the cone must be smaller to be able to move back and 
forth fast enough to keep up. Lower frequencies have to move back and forth 
more slowly, and smaller drivers have a hard time with these. So you find 
that drivers are designed for specific audio frequency ranges.

179
 Chapter 12: Speaker of the House
Most speakers that have multiple drivers in their speaker enclosure have 
electronic circuits known as crossovers, which divide up inbound speaker sig-
nals and distribute them to the appropriate driver.
Drivers in speaker-market lingo
You’ll most often run into two types of speakers on the market:
 
 Two-way: These have a woofer and a tweeter in one speaker enclosure.
 
 Three-way: These have a woofer, a tweeter, and a midrange driver in the 
same enclosure.
 
You’ll also find speakers with multiple tweeters or midrange drivers, and 
occasionally four-way speakers with two of the frequencies divided among 
four different drivers (or four different sets of drivers — for example, two 
tweeters and two pairs of different-sized midrange drivers). You can even 
find some speakers (typically smaller satellite speakers designed for wall 
mounting) with only one driver to handle both the bass and the treble. A 
huge amount of variety is out there.
 
More drivers doesn’t always mean better sound, but often speakers with mul-
tiple drivers sound better because each of the individual woofer, midrange, 
and tweeter drivers can be optimized to reproduce a specific range of frequen-
cies. Keep in mind that it’s hard for a driver to reproduce the whole range of 
audio frequencies equally well.
The use of the cone-shaped diaphragm and electromagnetic-powered move-
ment is specific to dynamic speakers, the class of speakers we’ve been 
discussing so far in this chapter. Generally, these are the speakers we recom-
mend for home theater. We should tell you, though, that you may run across 
other speakers when touring your local audio showroom or electronics 
superstore — speakers that are more expensive and are used for specific pur-
poses. In most cases, we don’t recommend the following speakers for home 
theater use:
 
 Electrostatic speakers: These are used primarily for stereo audio listening 
and are rare in home theater systems. They can’t handle bass and are 
rather limited in where and how you position them.
 
 Planar-magnetic speakers: For similar reasons, these are not likely to be 
useful for your home theater application because they are best used for 
the higher frequencies only.
 
We mention electrostatic and planar-magnetic speakers in case someone tries 
to sell you some. Unless you really know what you’re doing with these types of 
speakers, you’re better off spending your money on quality dynamic speakers.

The pole position
You’ll also run into speakers with more than one set of speaker drivers, 
facing in different directions:
 
 Monopole: These speakers have all the drivers on one face of the enclo-
sure and are known as direct radiating speakers. These can be used any-
where in your home theater.
 
 Bipole: These speakers have drivers on two faces, opposite each other. 
They are designed for side/rear surround speaker applications.
 
 Dipole: These speakers have drivers on two faces, opposite each other. 
They are designed for side/rear surround speaker applications.
 
 Bipole and dipole speakers sound pretty much the same, huh? Well, 
physically they are quite alike, but we’ll discuss in the following section 
how the differ functionally.
 
 Omnipole: These speakers radiate their sound in all directions, in a 360-
degree fashion, and are popular for outdoor applications. We won’t talk 
much about these here. We just wanted you to know they exist.
To understand the difference between bipole and dipole speakers, we have to 
get technical for a minute, but it’s an important tangent discussion.
Harken back to your science class days when you studied topics of phase, 
specifically being in phase and out of phase. In a general sense, something is 
in phase when it acts in the same pattern and time session as something else, 
and out of phase when it doesn’t. Because controlling the way sound waves 
interact with each other is a key component of home theater, you have to 
deal with the concept of phase.
Bipole and dipole speakers are designed to help contribute to your surround-
sound field. All you need to know for now, however, are some basics about 
how they work. Bipole speakers fire their cones to the front and rear (remem-
ber, they have drivers on two planes) at the same time and in phase. In other 
words, the cones go out or in together, in the same direction (both out or 
both in) and at the same time. Dipole speakers are out of phase with each 
other. When one side’s drivers are pushing out, the other side’s drivers are 
pulling in. See the section, “Surround speakers,” later in this chapter, for an 
explanation of how these speakers help create surround sound.
 
Although the electrical phase in bipoles and dipoles is different, the basic 
construction of bipoles and dipoles is very similar. You can find speakers on 
the market that can be both bipoles and dipoles. Most of these speakers have 
a switch that lets you switch the mode they operate in. Some people prefer 
music played back through bipoles and movies through dipoles, and these 
speakers let you make that choice on-the-fly.

181
 Chapter 12: Speaker of the House
 
Bipoles and dipoles (and omnipole speakers for that matter) all provide a 
more diffuse surround-sound experience. There’s nothing wrong with this, and 
in some cases it can enhance your experience, but today’s surround-sound 
soundtracks are recorded and mastered (the final mixing, volume leveling, and 
so on) using direct radiating speakers and the discrete surround-sound chan-
nels with Dolby Digital or DTS (or their new higher-resolution counterparts 
such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio). You’ll get the best and 
most precise surround-sound performance when all of your speakers (front, 
center, and surround) are direct radiators. If you find a set of nondirect radiat-
ing speakers that you love, go for it, but if you’re looking for the most precise 
surround sound, go with direct radiators.
Enclosed for your convenience
Your speaker enclosure, it turns out, is critical. You see, with all the shaking 
your drivers do, if you have a flimsy speaker encasement, it’s going to make 
a lot of noise, fall apart, or both. Your enclosure should be able to handle the 
vibrations with ease and should add little sound interference to the sound 
emanating from the drivers.
The two major types of enclosures are sealed (also known as acoustic suspen-
sion) enclosures and ported (also known as bass reflex) enclosures. A sealed 
enclosure is what it sounds like; it’s an airtight case. As your driver moves 
back and forth, the air pressure in the speaker constantly changes. This puts 
extra pressure from behind on the diaphragm as it moves in and out, and 
that takes extra power to overcome. On the positive side, that extra pressure 
makes the cone snap back and forth faster and with more precision, giving 
you a crisper, more accurate sound.
A more efficient speaker design is the ported enclosure. In the front of this 
enclosure is a hole (port) that equalizes pressure between the inside and 
outside of the speaker. When the diaphragm moves back into the speaker, it 
increases the internal pressure, which is funneled out through the front port 
of the speaker. This augments the sound waves traveling from the speaker, 
and increases the efficiency tremendously. The downside is that you may get 
less accurate results from a reproductive sound perspective. That’s because 
a ported enclosure doesn’t have the benefit of the extra pressure influencing 
the reverberating diaphragm. So the speaker sound might reproduce bass 
notes less precisely — substituting a louder boominess for a more realistic 
reproduction of the low notes. (Less realistic reproduction here means that 
your low notes don’t have as much house-shaking “oomph” as they should.)
 
Ported enclosures can dramatically decrease your power requirements 
because they increase the bass output of a speaker by around 3 dB compared 
to a sealed enclosure. To match a 3 dB output boost through amplification, 
the power applied to the speaker needs to be doubled. So if a bass reflex 

182
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
enclosure speaker was powered with a 150-watt amplifier, a sealed enclosure 
speaker would require a 300-watt amplifier to produce the same output. That’s 
a pretty awesome improvement.
In the end, you can be happy with either sealed or ported designs. Just keep 
in mind that these units handle bass differently and that good design and 
construction can minimize problems associated with either speaker design.
Inside, outside, upside down?
As if all this were not enough, you’ll probably run into four generic shape and 
size categories of speakers for your home entertainment system:
 
 Floor-standing: These speakers can be as tall as you are, can handle the 
full range of frequencies, and may or may not be used to produce the 
low-bass frequencies often taken over by the subwoofer.
 
 Bookshelf: These aptly named speakers are designed for smaller foot-
prints (the amount of space they take up). You often find them on a 
bookshelf or discreetly mounted on the wall. Sometimes, you see them 
on speaker stands to bring them up to ear level (which is the best way 
to install these types of speakers, in our opinion). They are usually 
designed to handle the midrange and high-end frequencies and are typi-
cally mated to a subwoofer in your installation. You may hear bookshelf 
speakers described as satellite speakers.
 
 Many manufacturers have designed special bookshelf-style speakers 
with mounting brackets and a sleek (and thin) enclosure designed for 
wall mounting next to a flat-panel plasma or LCD display. These speakers 
are usually referred to as wall mounts.
 
 Subwoofer: These speakers are larger and heavier than the bookshelf 
models and are usually kept on the floor due to their size and weight. 
These contain the large drivers for low-frequency use.
 
 In-wall: In-wall speakers share most of their characteristics with book-
shelf models; these are smaller speakers designed more for the mid-
range and high-end frequencies. Although some have enclosures that 
are mounted into the wall, the majority of these systems use the wall’s 
own enclosed nature as its enclosure. The drivers and other pieces and 
parts (like the crossovers) are mounted in a frame that is fitted flush 
with the wall or ceiling.
 
 In general, in-wall speakers are more for whole-home background music 
and to contribute to the surround-sound of a home theater. For the most 
part, the benefit of these speakers is their ability to be installed in places 
that have more aesthetic than acoustic appeal. They stay tucked away 
in corners or low on walls. Also, depending on the construction of the 

183
 Chapter 12: Speaker of the House
walls themselves, in-wall speakers that lack their own enclosure may 
spread sound along the wall rather than direct sound forward. If you 
find yourself planning in-wall speakers, take some extra time to study 
the best ways to optimize their location and performance. This is not to 
say that there aren’t good-sounding in-wall speakers — there are, and 
many high-end manufacturers make in-wall speakers these days. But 
good in-walls are typically more expensive than otherwise comparable 
bookshelf or floor-standing speakers.
Active and passive speakers
Finally, all speakers, regardless of the number of drivers, pole type, enclo-
sure type, or whatever, fall into one of two categories: active or passive. How 
they’re classified depends on their relationship to the amplifier driving them.
The vast majority of speakers are passive. A passive speaker doesn’t have a 
built-in amplifier; it needs to be connected to your amplifier through normal 
speaker wire. This speaker-level signal has been amplified enough to drive 
the speakers sufficiently.
Active speakers, on the other hand, have a built-in amplifier and are fed by a 
low-level (line-level) signal passed along an interconnect cable originating at 
your preamplifier or controller. Because the amplifier is an active electronic 
device, it needs power, and so you have to put any active speakers near 
power outlets.
For most home theaters, the subwoofer is probably going to be your only 
active speaker (though you can also find passive subwoofers; some high-
end home theater systems use these). There’s no practical reason for any of 
your other speakers to be active. Active speakers limit your ability to choose 
amplifiers tailored to your home theater and are generally more expensive 
than what we’ve been talking about. They are also much harder to find. Most 
active speakers are in either the low price/low-end category (designed for 
hooking into PCs or portable CD/MP3 players) or the really high end (where 
the speakers cost $5000 to $10,000 each).
Setting Up Surround Sound
Whew. You still with us? Well, if you are, the worst is behind you. Now you 
can apply all this newfound knowledge to a discussion of your surround-
sound system. In this section, we talk about the different speakers found in 
any home theater system — the center channel speaker, the left and right 
front speakers, the surround channel speakers, and the subwoofer. (To see 
what a surround sound setup looks like, see Figure 12-1.

Center speakers
We start with the center speaker. On the one hand, the center speaker is 
probably the most important speaker in your system; on the other hand, it’s 
(supposedly) optional. How can that be, you ask?
Stereostone Age
If you decide to extend your home theater 
outside the boundaries of your home theater 
room, you may consider outdoor speakers 
for your gardens, pool area, or soon-to-be-
outdoor theater greens. The discussion in this 
speaker section is pertinent also to shopping 
for outdoor speakers. One of the leading ven-
dors is Stereostone (www.stereostone.
com), which makes speakers in all sorts of 
simulated rock forms and colors, such as brown 
sandstone and black lava. There are omnidirec-
tional speakers, subwoofers, and even stereo 
fountains. You can get them with or without 
visible grills in the layers of the rock, and with 
volume controls for individual speaker control. 
All this in weatherproof enclosures that start 
as low as $150 and go up to $1000 for the most 
sophisticated models. Other manufacturers, 
such as Klipsch, have begun offering their own 
outdoor “rock” speakers.

185
 Chapter 12: Speaker of the House
 
Well, many people say the center speaker is optional because the left and right 
speakers can handle the sound that comes from the center speaker. However, 
we think that you miss out on a lot, and we don’t recommend this setup at all. 
The front center speaker, we feel, is critical and not at all optional, but some 
budget crunchers will try to convince you that it is.
Now, why is it critical? Ah, our favorite subject. The center speaker anchors 
your onscreen dialog and serves as a seamless connection between your 
left and right speakers. As that boat zooms by from left to right, you don’t 
want to have a gap in the middle of your sound field (a concern as screens 
get larger and larger). Center speakers are usually located behind the screen 
or above or below displays so that you can localize the onscreen sound as 
much as possible.
To achieve this seamless harmony with the left and right front speakers, your 
choice of center speaker is important. Don’t skimp on the center speaker in 
favor of your other front speakers. Each speaker (left, center, and right) is 
equally important and should be of similar size, similar capability, and pref-
erably come from the same manufacturer. In fact, if you can use an identical 
model speaker for the center, left, and right speakers (we talk about them in 
just a second), do it. Many folks can’t do this because they’ve chosen tower 
speakers for their left and right speakers, and can’t possibly install a tower 
speaker on top of their display as a center channel speaker. (And if you’re 
not using dipole or bipole speakers for your surround channels, you should 
consider using another identical pair of speakers for your surrounds as well.)
 
Make sure any speakers that will be close to a cathode ray tube (direct-view) 
video display are video shielded — especially the center speaker. If not, the 
speakers will cause video distortion on your screen. This is most important 
for your center speaker (which may rest directly on top of your display), but 
can also be an issue for your left and right speakers if they are close to the dis-
play as well.
Connections are everything
When connecting your receiver or amplifier to 
your speakers, you’re pretty much going to find 
two types of connectors: spring clips and five-
way binding posts. Spring clips are considered 
the lower end of the two, and most audiophiles 
tend to put them down. You see, spring clips 
have more exposed wiring, less surface contact, 
and greater likelihood of signal degradation over 
time due to this exposed wiring. Five-way bind-
ing posts, on the other hand, have a much more 
flexible connection structure. Not surprisingly, 
you can connect at least five ways. There are 
pin-form connectors, spade lugs, banana plugs, 
and a large washer-like area at the base that 
allows for more extensive contact with bare wire. 
There’s too much to try to put into words here; 
we recommend that you get someone at a stereo 
store to show you a five-way binding post. Just 
know that the five-way binding posts are the way 
to go if you have a choice.

186

Left and right speakers
We’ve cheated somewhat by talking a lot about the front left and right 
speakers already in this chapter. If possible, these speakers should be
 
 Full-range speakers: Yes, even if you plan on using a subwoofer.
 
 Ear level: We’d recommend this level even for your bookshelf-style 
speakers. If the speakers are large, try to arrange it so that the tweeters 
are at ear level.
 
 Of similar performance capability as the center speaker: We’d even 
say they should come from the same manufacturer.
We talk in Chapter 2 about whether you can use your existing speakers with 
your home theater, and the bottom line is that if you do, try to buy a center 
speaker from the same manufacturer and class for the best results.
 
In an ideal world, you use exactly the same model of speaker for your center, 
left, and right speakers — all your front speakers. This isn’t always practical, 
but we highly recommend you buy all three of these speakers from the same 
manufacturer and make sure that the manufacturer has designed them to be 
timbre matched — in other words, that they sound alike. This ensures that you 
get a more seamless listening experience.
Surround speakers
No matter what the setup of your speakers for surround sound — whether 
you have two, three, four, or more side and back speakers — your surround 
speakers play a role in your home theater that’s just as significant as that 
played by the speakers up front. Specifically, the surround speakers add a 
third dimension to your audio programming — bringing a front and back 
dimension to the left and right dimension provided by the front speakers.
This brings us back to the bipole/dipole speakers we discuss earlier in the 
chapter. Recall that the purpose of the center speaker is to provide highly 
localized speaker information; it’s coming from the center of the screen. 
There’s a high correlation between what you see on the screen and where 
the sound comes from.
And likewise, the left and right speakers provide more lateral, but still highly 
localized and directed, sound. Together, the three represent the frontal face 
of your home theater sound experience. When there is a specific sound — 
the clash of swords, the shout of the main character, the click of a trigger 
being pulled back — the sound comes predominantly from these speakers.

187
 Chapter 12: Speaker of the House
When it comes to surround speakers, you will find some differing philoso-
phies about how precise the location information provided by the speakers 
should be. Traditionally, before the discrete surround-sound systems such 
as Dolby Digital and DTS were so common, many people preferred the more 
diffuse sound (one that can’t be easily localized to a specific point) provided 
by bipoles and dipoles. When the surround sounds are more ambient — for 
example, the sound of rain splashing on the ground — a diffuse sound pat-
tern can be preferable. Similarly with nondiscrete surround-sound sources, 
such as Dolby Pro Logic, with its monophonic surround channel with a lim-
ited range of frequencies supported, a diffuse surround experience can also 
be a better choice.
On the other hand, with Dolby Digital and DTS (with their discrete surround-
sound channels), the folks who master the audio soundtracks do so using 
direct radiating speakers, and they develop the soundtracks with the thought 
that you too will be using such speakers. So the surround track of your favorite 
movies and TV shows will be designed to provide audio cues that are sup-
posed to be located in precise places in the sound field. To take full advantage 
of this, you should use direct radiating speakers for your surround speakers.
 
As we said earlier in the chapter, if you find some bipole, dipole, or omnipole 
speakers that you love, by all means get them. If, however, you primarily watch 
DVD, Blu-ray, or Dolby Digital–encoded HDTV programming in your home 
theater and you want the most accurate surround sound, we recommend 
that you choose surrounds that are direct radiators. These are easy to find 
(most surround speakers these days are direct radiators) — you can safely 
assume that if the speaker is not labeled as bipole, dipole, or omnipole, it is 
a direct radiating speaker.
Going virtual
In a perfect world, we’d all have room in our home theaters for eight separate 
speakers (including the subwoofer), and we’d have all our speaker cables 
neatly hidden inside the walls. In other words, we’d have a butt-kicking but 
aesthetically 7.1-channel surround-sound system.
Sometimes, however, reality intrudes upon our perfect home theater world. 
Some folks just don’t have the room for a full surround-sound setup, or they 
have issues with the layout or construction of their room that keeps them 
from installing the full complement of surround speakers.
Many folks in this predicament are forced to stick with two-channel (stereo) 
audio and thus forgo surround sound. However, there is an alternative: 
Several manufacturers produce virtual surround-sound speaker systems that 
incorporate multiple speaker drivers and some fancy electronics in a single 

188
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
speaker unit, which you place in the front of the room (usually right above or 
below your display).
These virtual systems use a combination of physical “aiming” and electronic 
trickery to introduce timing delays in the sound coming out of the speakers’ 
drivers, which makes the sound “bounce” off your walls in a coordinated 
fashion. The result — while typically not as immersive as a full set of sur-
round speakers — can come a lot closer to real surround sound than a pair 
of stereo speakers.
The technology that drives many of these systems comes from the folks at 
Dolby Labs (who we’ve talked about a lot throughout this book, because 
they’re at the heart of many home theater technologies). Dolby Virtual 
Speaker (www.dolby.com/consumer/technology/virtual_speaker.
html) is Dolby’s system for providing a 5.1-channel experience from two or 
three speakers.
A great example of a speaker system using Dolby Virtual Speaker is the 
Klipsch (www.klipsch.com) CS-500 2.1 Home Theater with DVD ($999). This 
system includes a 2.1-channel speaker system (two satellites mounted in the 
front of your room plus a subwoofer (discussed in the next section), along with 
a main unit that acts as a home theater receiver (see Chapter 11) and a DVD 
player (see Chapter 6). Figure 12-2 shows the CS-500 in all its compact glory.

189
 Chapter 12: Speaker of the House
You can also find speakers known as soundbars. These are wide (but short), 
wall-mounted speakers designed to be mounted underneath a flat-panel TV. 
Soundbars (such as Yamaha’s YSP-1100 digital sound projector, $1299) have 
multiple speaker drivers built into a single cabinet (the Yamaha we mention 
has forty-two drivers!) and typically include built-in amplification (that is, they 
are active speakers). A soundbar isn’t always the cheapest option, but it is an 
elegant one if you want to minimize your installation work.
 
We’ve heard some great sounds out of virtual surround systems, but if your 
budget allows it and your room supports the installation of five to seven 
speakers plus a subwoofer, we recommend that you install a full surround-
sound speaker system. If you can’t install all those speakers (maybe you rent 
or have a tiny room), you’ll most likely be happy with a virtual system.
Subwoofers in the mix
Most subwoofers have floor-based enclosures with active speaker systems 
(that is, with built-in amplifiers) for driving the low bass frequency ranges. 
Your biggest decision comes in bass management. That is, how do you want 
the bass signals in your system to be handled? You have a couple of options:
 
 The subwoofer can complement your full-range front speakers, 
providing an even fuller bass signal.
 
 The subwoofer can handle all the bass, giving your front speakers the 
ability to focus on the mid- and high-range frequencies.
Most home theater experts will advise you to move all bass to the subwoofer. 
This results in more power and attention to the mid- and high-frequency 
drivers and less strain on the amplifier and speaker systems. This setup also 
gives you a more dynamic range, because the bass can go lower than most 
full-range speaker woofers can themselves (hence the term subwoofer).
 
If you have a modern A/V receiver, you use a standard line-level audio inter-
connect cable to connect your subwoofer to the receiver. (We talk about 
these cables in Chapter 16.) If you’re using an older receiver as a stopgap until 
you purchase that nice new Dolby Digital A/V receiver, look for a subwoofer 
that also accepts speaker-level connections. These connections enable you 
to run the speaker wires from your receiver to the subwoofer and then on to 
your front right and left speakers. In this case, there’s no direct connection 
between your receiver and your front speakers — the front speaker outputs 
on the receiver are connected directly into the subwoofer, which is then con-
nected with another set of speaker cables to the front speakers themselves. 
This type of connection isn’t as good as a line-level one, but it works.

190
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
Many subwoofers come with an auto on/off function that turns the active 
subwoofer’s amplifier on and off with the presence of a signal. So the amplifier 
turns itself on when you’re playing music or a movie soundtrack and then off 
again a few minutes after you’re done. Pretty handy.
Recall that the subwoofer is usually powered by its own amplifier. As such, it 
has a volume control and a phase adjustment switch. You adjust the volume 
when fine-tuning your system and pretty much leave it at that setting. Your 
phase adjustment switch is sometimes a +/–180 degree switch and sometimes 
a continuously variable switch from 0 to +/–180 degrees (preferable). Phase 
adjustment comes into play when trying to fine-tune your system vis-à-vis 
your front left and right speakers. You adjust the phase of the subwoofer so 
that the sound coming from each is relatively in alignment, despite the fact 
that the subwoofer and front speakers may be located at different distances 
from the listeners. By adjusting the phase, you can move the timing of the 
sound coming from the subwoofer.
In Chapter 21, we explain how to link your bass with transducers to provide a 
truly ground-shaking, home theater experience.
Getting heady(phones) at home
You will see advertisements for surround-sound 
headphones. We hope you’ve understood enough 
in this chapter to say, “How can you cram five 
speakers and a subwoofer into a set of two-
speaker headphones?” Hey, good question!
It’s simple. No matter how many speakers you 
use in your system, you are still listening with 
two ears. These “surround-sound” headphones 
basically try to reproduce what is arriving at your 
ears by using digital signal processors (DSPs). 
Dolby has gone one step further with a Dolby 
Headphone encoder (www.dolby.com/
dolbyheadphone) that simulates Dolby Digital 
5.1 over the two headphone channels and can be 
built right into a receiver. With Dolby Headphone, 
you don’t use special headphones — any old 
pair of high-quality headphones will do the trick. 
Pretty cool, if you ask us.
If you plan on using headphones a lot (perhaps 
because your spouse does not like the movies 
you watch, eh, Pat?), check whether your 
receiver supports Dolby Headphone.

e spend a lot of time in this part of the book talking about the audio 
systems that envelop you in surround sound and aurally immerse 
you in a movie. But let’s face facts — we call it watching a movie because 
that’s what we do. The audio creates the ambience, but the display is what 
you focus on. So choosing a high-quality video system that can properly dis-
play the content you want to watch — whether that content comes from tra-
ditional broadcast/cable/satellite TV, from DVD or Blu-ray disc, or even from 
Internet sources — is essential.
In this chapter, we talk about the lingo of the TV world as our way of helping 
you make sense of all the terms and jargon you hear when you’re shopping 
for a new display. We also talk about what it means for a display to be consid-
ered an HDTV (or high-definition TV), which, by the way, we feel has become 
a mandatory choice for your home theater. Finally, we discuss the different 
types of displays you can run into in a home theater and give you the low-

In Chapter 14, we talk in-depth about each of the major categories of home 
theater displays, discussing the pros and cons of each type. So, if you already 
have a good feeling for what 1080p is, for example, as well as the difference 
between an HDTV and an HDTV monitor, you probably don’t need to linger 
here. Go ahead and skip right to Chapter 14 to get to the nitty-gritty — our

Learning the Lingo
If you’re shopping for a TV for your home theater, you’re probably going to 
run into salespeople, Web sites, and brochures full of acronyms and unfamil-
iar terms. Unfortunately, the technology industry tends to market its prod-
ucts with a list of features that are designed to bludgeon you upside the head 
and leave you with glassy eyes and a maxed-out credit card.
We’re here to help. The following sections cover some of the most significant 
features and performance stats that you’ll hear as you shop.
Screen size
We won’t insult your intelligence by telling you what screen size means, but 
we will tell you how it’s measured. With a single exception (screens for front-
projector systems), displays are measured diagonally. This is important to 
keep in mind because 16:9 and 4:3 screen sizes can’t be directly compared 
diagonally — it’s an apples and oranges thing. For example, a 16:9 32-inch 
screen is about 28 inches wide and a bit less than 16 inches high, while a 4:3 
32-inch screen is 25.6 inches wide and a hair over 19 inches high.
 
So if you’re moving from a 32-inch non-widescreen TV to an HDTV, don’t think 
that a 32” HDTV will be exactly the same size — it will be wider, but the screen 
height will be smaller. In general, screen height is what people perceive as the 
“size” of a TV — it dictates how big Yao Min looks while you’re watching that 
basketball game (well, he always looks big), or how big the talking heads on 
Sunday morning news shows are (RIP Tim Russert!). What we’re getting at here 
is that if you’re coming out of the old analog TV world and moving into your 
first widescreen HDTV, you’re going to need to recalibrate your thoughts on 
how big a certain sized TV actually is. A good site that makes these compari-
sons in more detail than we can get into in print is www.screenmath.com/.
Before you buy any television, you need to consider the size of your room 
and your expected seating distance from the display. As a gut reaction, most 
people think bigger is better when it comes to TV, but that’s not the case. 
Just as a TV can be obviously too small for a room (try sitting 15 feet back 
from a 27-inch TV), the opposite can be true. (Yes, Virginia, a TV can in fact 
be too darn big for a room.) And we’re not just talking about being physically 
too big to fit in the room (or to look acceptable to your spouse, décor-wise), 
but also being visually too big.
Every video display has some sort of line structure (or, more accurately, in 
the case of digital HDTV displays, pixel structure). The picture you see on 
your screen is made up of a series of individual points of light. Generally 
speaking, the bigger the screen, the bigger these individual points. When 
you sit back a reasonable distance, your eyes can’t discern these individual 

193
 Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options 
items, but if you get too close, they can. (Don’t believe us? Turn on any TV in 
your house and walk right up to it. Take a look. See?)
Because line or pixel size depends on the size of the screen, the distance at 
which you can make out this structure varies by screen size. (The number 
of lines or pixels being displayed plays a part, too, which makes this effect 
slightly less noticeable on HDTVs that fit 720 or even 1080 vertically mea-
sured lines on the screen, instead of 480.)
 
Generally, we recommend that you sit 11/2 to 21/2 screen-size measurements 
from an HDTV and three screen sizes from a non-HDTV. So for a typical 
50-inch HDTV, you can have an optimal picture if your seating is between 6 
feet, 3 inches and 10 feet, 5 inches. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule — you can 
certainly get a little bit closer, or go a couple feet away without wanting to 
throw a shoe at the TV. Note that we said you can sit closer to an HDTV than 
you can to a traditional TV simply because the screen has more lines and 
pixels (which makes them smaller and harder to see individually). The real 
goal of these measurements is to make sure that, for any particular viewing 
distance, your screen is close enough to give you a truly immersive big-screen 
experience without being so big that you can make out the individual elements 
that make up the picture.
 
Lots of folks just want a gigantic TV. Nothing wrong with that in our minds, but 
do pay a little attention to these formulas so you don’t end up with a screen 
so big that you can make out the individual pixels and lines — it makes the 
picture much less realistic, and it can be annoying. Certain types of displays, 
such as LCD (liquid crystal display) flat panels and LCD projection TVs, have 
pixels with physical characteristics that make them even more noticeable 
when you’re close up — keep this in mind when you’re choosing a display.
You can turn this equation around (ah, the wonders of math, huh?). If you 
have a good idea of how big your home theater room will be (we bet that 
you do) and also how far your primary seating area will be from the screen, 
you can use these guidelines to determine how big a display you need. If 
you’re going for a widescreen HDTV, measure the distance to your seating 
area, divide by 1.5 to 2.5, and then multiply this number by 12 (assuming you 
measured in feet) to determine your optimal screen size in inches (measured 
diagonally). Substitute a 3 for the 2.5 if you’re going with an old-fashioned 
non-HDTV set. But you really shouldn’t be doing that — and frankly, you’ll 
have a hard time even buying a big screen that’s not an HDTV these days.
 
Many of the newest high-definition TVs, which are fully capable of 1080p dis-
play resolutions, can be comfortably viewed at even closer distances than the 
older and cheaper 720p HDTVs. If you’re going to sit relatively close to a TV 
(again, relative to its screen size and that minimum 1.5 times screen size rec-
ommendation), you’re better off considering a 1080p HDTV, which has smaller 
(and therefore less discernable) pixels. With a 1080p HDTV you’re much less 
likely to see the individual picture elements with these displays, even if you’re 
considerably closer than 1.5 times the screen size.

194

Table 13-1 is a rough guideline for screen size versus distance from the 
screen. Keep in mind that you don’t have to be exact here — these are guide-
lines. If you want to go up or down a screen size from these recommenda-
tions, feel free — it shouldn’t cause you any real viewing issues.

Aspect ratio
We already let the cat out of the bag on the subject of aspect ratio (several 
times in the book), but let’s repeat it because it’s important — displays can 
be shaped for widescreen material (16:9) or for traditional TV viewing (4:3).
Although you can still find some 4:3 displays on the market, for home theater 
purposes, we think you need to go with a widescreen (16:9) display — that’s 
the right aspect ratio for DVDs, high-definition TV programming, and even 
many video games. If you’re buying a cheap tube TV for the kitchen or guest 
bedroom, you might choose to go with 4:3, but for theater viewing, you need 
to go widescreen.
Picture adjustability
Any display allows you to adjust the specific settings for your picture (and 
this is something we highly recommend). To do so, you typically use an 
onscreen display and your remote control.
Most people think of these settings as something to do once and never change. 
In fact, different environments might call for different settings. You might have 
one setting for the darkened-room home theater environment and another set-
ting that deals better with ambient light for the brightly lit Super Bowl party.

195
 Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options 
Some systems let you save these settings as presets so that you can quickly 
access a certain group of settings without having to manually readjust every 
setting each time you want to re-create your settings. It’s nice to be able to 
press a few buttons and get things back to the optimal movie watching set-
tings without readjusting your picture manually.
 
We recommend that you choose a display that lets you set the picture sepa-
rately for each input or source device. That way, you can customize your set-
tings individually — one setting for the HDTV cable box on your HDMI input, 
for example, and another for the DVD player and other devices coming into 
one of your display’s component video inputs from your A/V receiver. We talk 
more about these settings in Chapter 20.
Connections on the back
When you get down to the business of connecting your A/V gear to your dis-
play, you need to make sure that your display has the right inputs to connect 
the source devices that will feed video into your home theater. Keep in mind 
that most video source devices have multiple types of video outputs, and 
that you can get the best picture quality if you use the right connection meth-
ods. So when you evaluate displays, remember that it’s not just the number of 
inputs that’s important, but rather the type. In fact, we’d argue in most cases 
that type is more important than the number of inputs.
 
We recommend that you connect most or all source devices directly to your 
A/V receiver, not your display, to simplify both hookup and operation. So it’s 
typically not all that important to have, for example, four different S-video 
inputs on the back of your TV. You’ll connect all S-video sources directly to 
your receiver and will need only a single S-video cable connecting the receiver 
to your TV.
You should make sure that your display has at least one of each of the 
following types of inputs (check out Figure 13-1; we discuss these inputs in 
detail in Chapter 16):
 
 Composite video
 
 S-video (Just like in the comic books, S here stands for Super, as in 
Super-video)
 
 Component video
 
 HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)
You should also expect to have a pair of analog audio inputs for each of these 
inputs (except for HDMI, which carries the audio on the same cable as it 
carries the video, which is very handy!).

196
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
You may also find the following inputs on your display, though they are much 
less common:
 
 DVI (Digital Video Interface), which can be used for PC connections
 
 VGA (Video Graphics Array), the old standby, used, like DVI, for 
connections to a PC
 
 FireWire; not common, but found on a few brands of HDTVs, mainly 
older models
 
Figure 13-1: 
That’s a lot 
of inputs!

While we find that having multiple numbers of each of these connection types 
can be overkill if you’re connecting your sources through the receiver (as we 
recommend), in some situations you’ll be very happy to have multiples of cer-
tain types of inputs:

197
 Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options 
 
 Component video: If your A/V receiver can’t handle high-definition sig-
nals through its component video inputs (almost all new home theater 
receivers can, but many older models can handle only DVD and not 
HDTV), you’ll want to have at least two sets of component video inputs 
on your display.
 
 HDMI: HDMI, as we discuss in Chapter 16, is rapidly becoming the 
method for connecting source components to high-definition TVs. Many 
A/V receivers don’t have HDMI video-switching capabilities (see Chapter 
11 to find out more about video switching), and many that do can accept 
only a couple of HDMI inputs.
 
We highly recommend that if you’re buying a new display, you choose one 
that has three HDMI inputs, to increase your options and give you some more 
flexibility when you add new components such as a Blu-ray disc player or a 
high-definition gaming console to your home theater.
 
If you don’t have enough HDMI inputs on your TV, you can always add an 
external HDMI video switch, as we discuss in Chapter 11.
Connections on the front
If you own a camcorder or some other portable video source device (such 
as a laptop computer that you may want to occasionally connect to your 
home theater display), you may want to choose a display with a set of A/V 
connectors on the front of the unit. It’s a lot easier to make quick, temporary 
connections this way than it is to try to climb behind your display and hook 
things up.
Look for a display that has at least one set of analog audio and video (pref-
erably both composite and S-video) connections on the front, Increasingly 
you’ll find component video or even HDMI front inputs on your HDTV, which 
we highly recommend if you have a gaming console or high-definition cam-
corder that you want to move between TVs. Note that many flat-panel TVs, 
as well as the thinner, microdisplay rear-projection models, hide these inputs 
on the side or even bottom (for wall-mounted displays) of the TV.
Monitor versus television
When a display comes with a built-in TV tuner (so you can plug in an antenna 
or a cable connection and immediately watch TV), we call it a television. Some 
displays — for example, many projectors and plasma displays — come without 
any built-in TV tuning capabilities; we call these displays monitors or HD-ready 

198
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
displays. In fact, some monitors don’t have a built-in audio speaker, so they 
don’t offer even a minimal audio capacity. (We don’t think this is a huge deal 
because any home theater worth its salt already has a good audio system, 
but for casual viewing, such as watching the news, you may not want to fire 
up your audio system.)
 
The vast majority of HDTVs sold today are truly HDTVs, with built-in tuners 
for picking up broadcast and (in most cases) unscrambled cable TV signals. 
The only HDTVs that typically do not have a built-in TV tuner these days are 
front-projection systems and some plasma TVs that are sold as commercial 
models (such as the ones you see used as digital signs or kiosks in stores, 
hotels, and airports).
Contrast ratio
If you look at TVs on a showroom floor, you might not ever realize this 
(because the displays have their brightness cranked up), but displays should 
be capable of showing both dark and light scenes. For example, you want to 
be able to see the flash of the artillery in Saving Private Ryan as well as the 
soldiers seeking cover in the shadows.
There’s a measurement for how well a display can show both bright brights 
and nuanced darks: contrast ratio. You’ll see this as a numeric ratio, some-
thing like 1000:1, representing the whitest white compared to the blackest 
black. Typically, direct-view (tube) displays and projector systems that use 
CRTs have the highest contrast ratios, whereas systems that use plasma or 
LCD technologies have the lowest. When it comes to contrast ratio, a higher 
ratio is better.
 
There isn’t a standardized, approved way of measuring contrast ratios, so one 
manufacturer’s 800:1 may not be the same as another’s. You need to rely on 
magazine and online reviews and use your own eyes in a thorough test drive 
at a dealer’s showroom. We like reviews that include a professional calibra-
tion of the display because that shows the display’s true ultimate capabilities. 
When you do a test drive, use some of your own DVDs that you know well.
Comb filter
Many video sources (such as broadcast NTSC television or composite video 
connections from other source devices) send both the color (chrominance) 
and brightness (luminance) parts of the video signal as a single combined 
signal. (The signal carried over a composite video cable is combined in this 
way.) Inside the TV, a notch filter or a comb filter separates these signals into 
their component parts. If signals aren’t properly separated, you see moving 
dots of color around the edges of images, a phenomenon called dot crawl.

199
 Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options 
Notch filters are the least effective at this process, whereas the various kinds 
of comb filters do a better job. You’ll find three kinds of comb filters in direct-
view displays:
 
 2-D comb filter: This is the least effective (and least expensive) kind of 
comb filter, though it’s better than a notch filter.
 
 3-D comb filter: We’re talking middle ground here — better than 2-D but 
not as good as the digital comb filter.
 
 Digital comb filter (sometimes called 3-D Y/C): Found in more expen-
sive direct-view sets, the digital comb filter uses more sophisticated 
(and digital!) signal processing to separate chrominance and luminance. 
This is the king of the hill when it comes to comb filters.
 
When you connect sources to your display with S-video, component video, or 
HDMI cables (discussed in Chapter 16), chrominance and luminance are sepa-
rated in the source device, not in your TV. The same is true for HDTV signals 
coming into your TV over the air or on a cable system (without a set-top box). 
In these cases, your display’s built-in comb filter is bypassed. In other words, 
the comb filter is important only for nondigital TV broadcasts (which will be 
turned off in the United States in February 2009) and for older source compo-
nents such as VCRs.
Resolution
As we discuss in Chapter 4, display resolution is a measure of a picture’s pre-
cision and sharpness. For standard-definition programming — such as NTSC 
television and, to a degree, DVD — this isn’t a huge deal. (Any display can 
handle the 480 vertical lines of resolution of these formats — which is not 
to say they’ll all look the same!) As you start getting into HDTV sources (and 
even widescreen anamorphic DVDs), resolution becomes a really big deal.
Generally, display vendors spend most of their time talking about the vertical 
resolution of their sets, which corresponds to the most commonly discussed 
resolutions of HDTV: 720 and 1080. Some displays (particularly those that 
have a fixed-pixel system, such as LCD or plasma) give resolution in terms 
of both horizontal and vertical numbers (similar to the way resolutions are 
discussed in the computer display world). So you might see, for example, a 
plasma display with a resolution of 1280 x 720p (which corresponds to 720p). 
In this case, the 1280 refers to the horizontal resolution (the number of 
pixels, or individual points, across the screen) and 720 refers to the vertical 
number (like the scan lines on a conventional TV).
 
As we mention in Chapter 4, displays are also classified by the input resolu-
tions that they can handle. These input resolutions are simply the resolu-
tions that the display can accept from source devices. The circuitry inside 
the display itself converts these signals (if necessary) to the display’s native 

200
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
display resolution. Read the fine print closely — some displays can accept high-
definition resolutions such as 720p but display it at a lower (not high-definition) 
resolution.
When you get into high-definition digital displays, you’ll find out that your 
display holds some circuitry that handles this conversion from input resolu-
tion to display resolution. This circuitry is known as the scaler because it 
scales the image from one size to another. When you’re reading reviews of 
different displays that you are considering, pay close attention to the capa-
bilities of this scaler; it will manipulate most of the video signals you send 
into your TV. (There aren’t necessarily going to be any hard, cold, objective 
numbers to describe scaler performance; instead, the reviews will talk about 
the absence of jagged lines and other visible picture distortions for scaled 
images.) All else being equal, a display with a better scaler will have a better 
picture, especially when it displays video sources that aren’t created in the 
display’s native display resolution.
Interlaced and progressive scan
In Chapter 4 (it’s a chapter you shouldn’t skip!), we talk about the two scanning 
methods that video displays use — interlaced and progressive. Traditional TV 
systems (such as NTSC, the standard TV system in the United States) use an 
interlaced scan, where half the picture appears on the screen at a time. The 
other half follows an instant later (1/60th of a second, to be precise). The inter-
laced system relies on the fact that your eyes can’t detect this procedure 
in action — at least not explicitly. In a progressive-scan system, the entire 
picture is painted at once, which greatly reduces the flickering that people 
notice when watching TV. Progressive scan is available throughout the range 
of TV types we’re about to discuss. We highly recommend progressive scan 
if it fits into your budget because the picture appears much smoother and 
more like a film. (You can get direct-view progressive-scan TVs for under 
$500 these days.)
 
All HDTVs are progressive-scan displays — so even if the signal being sent to 
the HDTV is interlaced, the HDTV will convert it to progressive scan for dis-
play on the screen.
Defining HDTVs
In the next section, we talk about the physical differences between the vari-
ous categories of displays (differences such as flat panel or projection). But 
before we do that, we want to cover one even higher-level distinction. That 
distinction is the following: Is the display capable of playing back HDTV at 
full resolution?

201
 Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options 
 
We talk a lot about what HDTV is in Chapter 4, including the fact that the 
next-generation digital TV (also called ATSC) has a bunch of different formats. 
Two of those formats, 1080i and 720p, qualify as high-definition television, or 
HDTV, as does the 1080p format found on Blu-ray discs.
In previous editions of Home Theater For Dummies we spent a fair amount of 
time talking about the choice between standard and high-definition TVs. At this 
point (we’re writing this in mid 2008), there is no longer a choice to make — if 
you’re buying a new TV for your home theater, you should buy an HDTV. In 
fact you probably won’t even be able to find a TV that’s bigger than about 20 
inches and not an HDTV. And the good news is that moving up to HDTV capa-
bilities won’t be much of a price jump.
 
You can buy an HDTV for well under $500 these days, so unless your budget 
is tight, we really think you should make an HDTV-capable display the center-
piece of your home theater. With HDTV broadcast programming becoming 
commonplace (see Chapter 7), and HDTV Blu-ray discs also hitting the market 
(see Chapter 6), there’s plenty of great HDTV content to watch on your big 
screen. So if you can swing it, we urge you to go the HDTV route!
We talk about HDTV back in Chapter 4. Here, we want to talk about the charac-
teristics of TVs and displays that can play back HDTV programming. The first 
layer of the HDTV onion that we should peel back is the concept of an HDTV 
versus an HDTV-ready system. An HDTV has the following key characteristics:
 
 Resolution: Can display true high-definition signals with at least 720 
lines of horizontal resolution (in other words, 720 lines of picture data 
stacked on top of each other vertically on the screen).
  
 The latest and greatest HDTVs can display the full 1920 x 1080 pixels 
of 1080i and 1080p HDTV signals. Such HDTVs are often called 1080p 
HDTVs.
 
 Aspect ratio: Has a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9.
 
 Tuner: Has a built-in TV tuner, which is capable of decoding any over-
the-air broadcast format within the ATSC digital television standard. 
(HDTVs that get their HDTV programming from an internal DSS receiver 
are also called HDTVs, even though they don’t strictly fit this definition.)
An HDTV-ready set, often called an HDTV monitor, must meet only the first 
two requirements — in other words, there’s no TV tuner in a monitor. All 
four types of displays we discuss in this book — direct-view, flat-panel, 
front-projection, and rear-projection systems — can be built as an HDTV or 
HDTV-ready system. And just like non-HDTV versions of these displays, a 
huge range of sizes and shapes is on the market. You can buy a 27-inch LCD 
(liquid crystal display — which we talk about in-depth in Chapter 14) HDTV 
for a bedroom or kitchen, or you can buy a $30,000 HDTV-ready projector 
that requires professional mounting and calibration and gives you an HDTV 
picture the size of some movie theater screens.

202
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Any TV that meets the three criteria we just listed can be called an HDTV. 
But that doesn’t make all HDTVs the same. Beyond the physical type of TV 
(which we discuss in the next section) and the actual picture quality of the 
TV (which varies TV by TV based on the type of TV and specific engineering 
and design decisions made by the manufacturer), you should consider some 
specific features and specifications when looking at HDTVs.
 
The following features and characteristics apply across the different types of 
TVs (LCD, plasma, and so on) unless we specifically say otherwise:
 
 HDTV versus Full HD HDTV: All HDTVs have a display resolution of at 
least 720p (1280 x 720 pixels). Those TVs which have a resolution of 
1920 x 1080 — those with 1080p display resolution, in other words — are 
often described as Full HD HDTVs. Eventually (we suspect) all HDTVs 
will be capable of displaying all the pixels in a 1080p signal, but today 
many do not. Should you care? Well if you absolutely have to have the 
latest and greatest thing, you should definitely get a Full HD 1080p set. 
Or if you’re going to have a particularly large HDTV for your home the-
ater room (a TV so big that you’ll be sitting less than 1.5 times the TV’s 
diagonal size away from the screen), you should definitely get a Full HD 
1080p HDTV.
 
 For everyone else, we think 1080p is a good-to-have but far from manda-
tory feature. Most people with average or even good eyesight sitting a typ-
ical distance from a typical HDTV (say 8 to 10 feet from a 50-inch HDTV) 
will not be able to see a difference between a 720p and a 1080p set (all 
other things being equal). If you want Full HD, we encourage you to get it. 
But if you find a TV that looks great to you, fits your budget, and is only 
720p, please don’t let the lack of Full HD keep you from buying it.
 
 Supported input resolutions: Just as HDTVs have a display resolution 
(the number of pixels on the screen), they also have supported input 
resolutions — these are the resolutions of incoming TV signals that the 
TV can accept and convert to the display resolution. Many HDTVs (even 
those with a display resolution of 1080p) can’t accept a 1080p, for exam-
ple. This issue mainly crops up (these days at least) with Blu-ray disc 
players, which are the only source for 1080p HDTV today. If you have a 
1080p display and have (or plan on getting) a Blu-ray disc player, you’re 
going to want an HDTV that can accept 1080p inputs. In the past, matching 
input resolutions on your TV with the output resolutions of your source 
components was often a source of frustration for home theater builders, 
but today it’s not often a problem (beyond the 1080p support issue).
 
 For Blu-ray discs, you should consider an HDTV that has Full HD capa-
bilities, supports 1080p input resolutions, and can support 1080p24. 
1080p24 (the 24 refers the frame rate) is a special mode in Blu-ray discs 
that matches the frame rate of the video to the frame rate used to record 

203
 Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options 
movies on film. 1080p24 provides the smoothest picture because your TV 
doesn’t need to perform 3:2 pulldown (see Chapter 4 for more on this).
 
 Deep color support: Most high-definition TV sources have a color depth 
(the number of digital bits used to store the color information of a par-
ticular video) of 8 bits per color (or 24 bits for red, green, and blue com-
bined). A few new high-end HDTVs support a new system called deep 
color (or, in tech terms, xvYCC). Deep color takes the color depth to 10, 
12, or more bits — meaning that video is then capable of supporting mil-
lions of colors (more than your eye can discern). The only source capa-
ble of deep color today is our old friend, the Blu-ray disc, and not many 
Blu-ray discs include this yet. But if you’re futureproofing your HDTV 
investment, you might want to consider deep color support for the day 
when deep color becomes more common.
 
 120 Hz refresh: As you may recall from Chapter 4, common video sources 
(including HDTV) have frame rates between 24 and 60 frames per second. 
A number of LCD TVs are designed to play all signals coming into the TV at 
120 frames per second (they do this by using some high-powered chips and 
some sophisticated math to interpolate what the picture would look like if 
it was recorded at 120 Hz (120 times per second). This faster refresh rate 
is designed to overcome a limitation of LCD TVs — namely that they have 
a slower response time to moving images on the screen (such as the ball 
moving across the screen in a ball game) than other TVs. The faster refresh 
rate is designed to improve this LCD issue (which is being improved by a 
range of other design and engineering tweaks as well) simply by updating 
the image on the screen more frequently.
 
 No source material for your HDTV is recorded at 120 Hz, so your TV is 
taking something that is not 120 Hz and doing some manipulation of the 
video to make it an approximation of what 120 Hz video would look like. 
This is similar to the scaling of video inside an HDTV, where the differing 
input resolutions are converted to the TV’s native display resolution. 
Some day we may see 120 Hz video on Blu-ray discs or other sources 
(perhaps on Internet-sourced video as we discuss in Chapter 10), but for 
now all the 120 Hz action is happening solely inside your TV.
Choosing a TV
As you shop for a display, you’ll find that, beyond all the brand and size 
choices, you need to make some high-level decisions about what kind of dis-
play you want. For many people, a display (or TV) means the traditional tube 
television that’s been around for decades. But new technologies have made 
flat-panel screens, which have no tube and are only a few inches deep, into 
a viable choice as well. And projection TVs, which shoot the picture onto a 

204
Par t III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
screen, have never been better, cheaper, and bigger. In this section, we give 
you an overview of the primary technologies that underlie different types of 
TVs. (In Chapter 14, we talk about each of these TV types in-depth, so you 
can understand the pros and cons of each.)
The first distinction to be made in the world of home theater displays 
revolves around how the picture gets to your eyeballs:
 
 With some displays, you are directly viewing the image created by the 
imaging hardware within the TV. In other words, the image is created on 
the screen you are watching. These displays are known as direct view. 
The most common type of direct-view display is the old-fashioned tube 
TV, but flat-panel (hang-on-the-wall) plasma and LCD TVs can also be 
considered direct-view displays.
 
 Other displays create the image in one place and then project it onto 
a screen elsewhere. These projector displays work much like a movie 
projector in a theater (and better than that noisy one in your third-grade 
social studies class) and can offer the biggest image size of any type of 
display. There are two types of projectors:
 
• Rear-projection systems, which display an image on the back of the 
screen, which you then view from the front.
 
• Front-projection systems, which display an image on the front of a 
screen (the same side you view the image on).
Beyond this initial categorization, displays are also categorized by the under-
lying technology that creates the image. There are a few dominant tech-
nologies here. Note that most of these technologies can be used for either 
direct-view or projection displays, depending on how they are implemented:
 
 CRT: CRT, or cathode ray tube, is the traditional technology behind TVs 
and home theater displays (for a long time, CRT was the only technol-
ogy, but that has changed a lot in the past ten years). CRTs can be used 
in both direct-view and projector applications.
 
 Plasma: Plasma (sometimes called PDP, or plasma display panel) dis-
plays use a grid of electrical circuits sandwiched between two plates 
of glass to electrically excite a gas and cause it to put out light. Plasma 
displays are the thin TVs (often less than 4 inches thick) that everyone’s 
dying to hang on their walls.
 
 LCD: LCDs do exactly what their name implies — they have liquid crys-
tal particles within them that can be aligned in different ways to create 
different colors. When a bright light shines through these crystals, you 
get a video picture. LCDs can be flat-panel TVs (like a plasma display), 
or they can be used in projection TVs (see the bullet on microdisplays 
coming up). If you’ve seen a laptop computer (or a desktop PC with a 
flat-panel display), you’ve seen an LCD.

205
 Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options 
 
 OLED: The newest flat panel technology is known as Organic Light Emitting 
Diode, or OLED. OLED displays are built of an organic material that is printed 
onto the display, and like plasma, OLED creates its own light (so there’s no 
backlight). OLED displays are even thinner than plasma or LCD displays 
and use less electricity than either. They also have extremely high contrast 
ratios and extraordinary color reproduction. Sounds great huh? Well it is, 
but unfortunately, OLED technology is still in its infancy and is mainly used 
in very small displays for cell phones and similar devices. As we write, only 
one manufacturer — Sony — makes an OLED HDTV. It has a stunning picture, 
is 3 millimeters thick, costs about $2500, and . . . is 11 inches diagonally. To 
put that in perspective, as we write, that’s the same price as a top-of-the-line 
50-inch 1080p plasma HDTV. Clearly OLED is a ways from being mainstream, 
but trust us on this, you can’t wait. It’s that good!
 
 Microdisplays: Traditionally, projection systems used CRT tubes to 
create the projected image. Most current projection systems use a 
microdisplay technology to do so instead. A microdisplay is exactly 
what the name says it is — basically a tiny display that uses some sort of 
miniaturized display technology to create an image that is then enlarged 
when it is beamed onto the projection screen. Several different technolo-
gies are within the microdisplay family:
 
• LCD: The same LCD technology used for flat-panel screens can be 
shrunken down and used in a projector.
 
• DLP: A DLP, or digital light processor, uses a special video chip 
from Texas Instruments that includes millions of microscopic mir-
rors that are moved by computer command (sort of like the robot 
in Lost in Space, only smaller!) to create an image.
 
• LCoS: Liquid Crystal on Silicon microdisplays use a special variant 
of LCD technology that’s shrunken down to the chip level.
 
As we mentioned, some of these technologies can be used in either direct-view 
or projection applications (CRT and LCD in particular), which can make things 
a bit confusing for the casual shopper. If you’re shopping online (or just com-
paring prices), and you don’t actually see the TV in front of you, make sure 
you read all the details. We’d hate for you to think you were getting an LCD 
flat panel to hang on the wall when you were actually pricing out an LCD front-
projection system that goes on the ceiling and needs a separate screen!

hoosing the right display for your home theater is one of the most 
important tasks you’ll face when you begin building your home theater. 
Your display is the most visible (no pun intended) part of your home the-
ater, and a great high-definition widescreen picture can really knock folks’ 
socks off. So choose the right display for your particular home theater, and 
you’ll be that much closer to the “being there” experience that you get at the 
movies.
In Chapter 13, we talk about all the things you should understand about 
displays in general, including the features and capabilities to look for when 
shopping for a new TV or display. Those discussions apply across all sorts 
of display types — for example, you’ll want HDMI inputs whether you are 
buying a plasma or a DLP rear-projection unit.
In this chapter, we take the discussion to the next level by examining each 
of the common types of displays you might choose for a home theater — 
plasma and LCD flat panels, and the whole array of front- and rear-projection 
TVs — and give you some insight into the pros and cons of each type. 
Combine this with the knowledge you gain by reading Chapter 13, and you’ll 
be ready to start shopping!
What about Tube TVs?
Admit it. You say it, too: “What’s on the tube?” C’mon, we all say it, and for 
good reason — for the past sixty-plus years, the vast majority of TVs have 
been direct-view CRT (or cathode ray tube) models. You know what they look 
like — kind of big and bulky, with a big (and relatively heavy) glass tube 
inside.

208
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
CRTs are now the senior citizens of the TV world, and the world of consumer 
electronics is ruthless when it comes to the next big thing. Most manufactur-
ers have dropped their CRT television model lines in favor of flat-panel and 
projection TVs (discussed throughout the rest of the chapter).
Those manufacturers who remain in the CRT television business typically do 
not still make the larger sizes that work best in a home theater environment 
(32 inches and above), but instead manufacture only small (24 inches and 
below) CRTs that are more suited to use in a bedroom or kitchen, not for a 
home theater.
A flat-panel tube?
As the era of the tube draws to a close, a new 
and somewhat similar technology called SED 
(surface-conduction electron-emitter display) 
has begun to trickle out of the labs. Toshiba and 
Canon were the two big proponents of this tech-
nology, which is in many ways a hybrid of the 
CRT and the plasma display. (In 2007, Toshiba 
decided SED was taking too long to develop 
and abandoned the technology, leaving Canon 
alone carrying the SED torch.)
SED displays (none are in production as we 
write, but we’ve seen demonstrations of some 
hand-built prototypes) are designed to be thin 
and flat, like a plasma TV, but at the same time 
provide the bright picture and the deep, deep 
blacks of a CRT. Essentially, an SED display 
takes the electron gun of a CRT and turns it into 
a big, flat panel that sends the electrons across 
a small vacuum to the phosphors on another 
flat panel of glass. It looks like a plasma display 
(because it’s thin and flat), but because it uses 
electrons hitting a phosphor layer, it has all the 
picture benefits of a CRT. (Plasma also uses 
electrons, but the process involves exciting a 
gas with an electrical charge, causing the gas 
to emit electrons, rather than just shooting them 
out of an electron gun.) And the great thing is 
that an SED can be high resolution (easily meet-
ing the 1920 x 1080 resolution of the highest 
HDTV standards) while using less than half the 
power of a plasma or LCD flat panel.
We’ve been blown away by demos we’ve 
seen of SED year after year at the Consumer 
Electronics show. But that’s all we (or anyone) 
has seen to date — demos of prototypes. Canon 
continues to promise that we’ll see production 
SED TVs soon. If Canon can truly deliver on the 
promise of SED, plasma and LCD may very well 
have to move out of the way as leaders of the 
flat-panel pack.
And if that’s not enough to anticipate, another 
technology (discussed in Chapter 13) called 
OLED (Organic LED), originally thought up by the 
folks at Kodak, is now hitting the market. This 
technology is similar to LCD but uses an organic 
material that can generate its own light — LCDs 
require a backlight to shine through the LCD — 
and will be thinner, and brighter than LCD. You 
can now buy Sony’s OLED 11-inch HDTV for 
about $2500. The picture will make your jaw 
drop almost as much as the dollars per inch of 
screen does.
Right now, OLED has been proven to be a “real” 
technology, and if manufacturers can find a way 
to build OLED sets in sizes we need in a home 
theater at a reasonable price, today’s flat-panel 
displays may well go the way of the CRT. SED 
must still prove itself, but like OLED, it’s worth 
keeping an eye on.

209
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
Even more importantly, no manufacturer (that we know of, at least) still 
offers a high-definition CRT TV. In the early 2000s, all major TV manufactur-
ers offered widescreen high-def CRTs — today they’re all gone. In some ways 
that’s a shame, because nothing else (except maybe the still nascent OLED 
TVs just hitting the market) offers a picture with the amazing contrast ratios 
and deep true blacks of the CRT. But CRTs were bulky (without being big in 
terms of screen size, they were heavy) and couldn’t approach the display 
resolution offered by today’s 1080p digital displays.
What’s our point here? Well if you have a CRT HDTV and you love it, by all 
means keep it in your home theater — at least until the urge for something 
bigger and sleeker overcomes you. But if you’re just starting to shop for your 
home theater’s display, don’t spend any time looking for a CRT TV to fill the 
role, because you just won’t find one, no matter how hard you look.
Thin Is In — Flat-Panel TVs
The coolest development in the TV world in years and years (and the source 
of billions of dollars in revenue for TV manufacturers) has been the advent 
of the flat-panel (notice we didn’t say flat-screen) display. These are TVs that 
you can hang on the wall. Flat-panel TVs use technologies such as LCD and 
plasma to create a TV that is barely bigger than the screen itself. These dis-
plays have a small frame around the edges of the screen and are about three 
or four inches deep. There are some tradeoffs to flat-panel displays, but if 
you can live with them, you can definitely find a place in your home theater 
for a flat-panel — literally!
Demystifying LCD
If you have a laptop computer, a digital watch, a handheld computer, or just 
about anything electronic, you’ve probably seen, touched, felt, and used 
a liquid crystal display, or LCD. We first saw LCDs on digital watches back 
when we were kids (we thought they were cool) and never imagined the size 
they’d grow to. We certainly never thought LCDs would one day display high-
resolution images with millions of gradations of color. But that’s exactly what 
they are doing, in an increasing number of homes and home theaters (see 
Figure 14-1).

Liquid crys-
tals put the

You may be wondering how LCD displays work. Well here’s the short answer. 
(Armies of lab-coated PhDs working at the manufacturers of these things can 
give you the long answer!) An LCD display consists of a large number of pixels, 
or picture elements, consisting of liquid crystal molecules held between two 
sets of transparent electrodes. These liquid crystals react in predictable ways 
when the electrical charge running between those electrodes is changed — 
meaning they twist and move in ways that let different amounts (and colors) of 
light through the crystals. The LCD has a control system that translates your 
video signals into the proper charges for each electrode. A light source (usu-
ally a fluorescent bulb, though LED bulbs are starting to hit the market) shines 
through the LCD panel (it’s built into your display and is typically there for the 
life of the display) and creates your picture.
 
Because the light shines through the liquid crystals, rather than reflecting 
off them or being created by them, an LCD is what is known as a transmissive 
display. Generally speaking, transmissive displays are slightly less bright — 
you lose some of the bulb’s brightness going through the crystals — but LCD 
makers can make up for this by using a really bright bulb for the backlight.
When compared to the other type of flat-panel display (plasma), LCDs tend to 
be found on the smaller end of the spectrum. You’ll rarely find a plasma TV 
smaller than 42 inches, but you can find LCDs at sizes as small as 13 inches. 
Similarly, on the larger end of the scale, most manufacturers tend to top out 
at about 57 inches on their LCD displays but go all the way up to 65 inches 
for plasmas. We should note here that you can find limited production ver-
sions of both LCD and plasma TVs in sizes up to and exceeding 100 inches, 
with prices in the many tens of thousands of dollars.
More importantly for the home theater buyer’s budget, LCD displays tend 
to be slightly more expensive for a given screen size than a plasma TV. 
Historically there was a significant difference, with LCDs costing 30 percent 
more than similar plasmas, but today any price difference is usually less than 
10 percent.

211
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
It’s hard to do a direct apples-to-apples price comparison between LCD and 
plasma TVs because the standard sizes of the two technologies are different. 
LCD HDTVs typically are offered in 37-, 40-, 47-, and 52-inch sizes (as well as 
smaller sizes), while plasmas are typically offered in 42-, 50-, 56-, and 65-inch 
sizes. (Note that not all manufacturers follow these conventions.)
If you do the math on a price-per-inch basis, however, a plasma will usually 
be slightly cheaper than an LCD, particularly in the larger sizes. But LCDs are 
more widely produced (think of all the LCD screens in laptop computers, PC 
monitors, navigation systems, and the like), so the downward price trends 
for LCDs may very well make them cheaper across the board by the time you 
read this.
We’re talking about direct-view LCDs here (where you look directly at the 
LCD, just as you look directly at the picture tube with direct-view tube TV). 
LCDs can also be used in projector TVs (both front and rear), and we talk 
about them later in this chapter in the “Getting Into Projection TVs” section.
A few companies make mega-big LCD displays. As we write (mid 2008), we’ve 
seen prototypes for LCD displays as big as 102 inches diagonally. And new 
technologies, such as OLED, promise LCD-like displays in even bigger sizes 
in the future. We’ve even seen prototype systems that seamlessly combine 
three smaller (and easier-to-build) LCD panels into a larger single panel — 
making a cheaper big LCD.
The vast majority of LCD television monitors are high-definition TVs and are 
built in the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, although you can still find 4:3 ver-
sions in smaller sizes (under, say, 20 inches). We prefer the widescreen ver-
sions of LCDs because 16:9 LCDs, unlike direct-view CRTs, don’t tend to wear 
out unevenly when used to display 4:3 video programming.
LCD displays have a few particular strong points when it comes to playing 
video:
 
 Extremely high resolutions: LCDs can easily reach HDTV resolutions 
(in fact, most LCD displays do). You can easily find a 1080p-capable LCD 
display in all but the smallest sizes — while many plasma displays are 
still 720p.
 
 Excellent color: LCDs offer exceptional reproduction of colors, with 
the potential for beautifully re-created colors across the spectrum. This 
differs from other flat-panel displays (such as plasma systems), which 
often tend to display certain colors inaccurately.
  
 Great picture: The newest and most expensive LCDs use an LED (light 
emitting diode) instead of a traditional bulb for their light source. These 
LEDs produce a higher-quality picture because the LED itself emits a 
more natural (closer to daylight) light than does a bulb (which tends to 
be yellowish, not true white).

212
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
 Energy efficiency: LCD HDTVs are perhaps the greenest HDTVs. 
Compared to plasmas, LCD HDTVs use less electricity to run. It’s hard 
to generalize an actual number (since there are great variations from 
model to model), but you can probably expect to use about 30 percent 
less power for an LCD than for a similar-sized plasma. Many TV manufac-
turers are making power consumption a big emphasis as we head into 
2009, so expect this to improve on both sides of the aisle.
 
 PC monitor–capable: Most LCD television displays can also do double-
duty as a PC monitor, plugging directly into any PC with a standard PC 
video cable.
 
 No burn-in: If you play a lot of video games, watch the stock ticker on 
MSNBC, or do other things with your display that involve a lot of static con-
tent (images that don’t change or move around) on a CRT display, you can 
end up with those images permanently burned into the phosphors on your 
screen. When these images become permanently etched into the phosphor, 
you see them even when you’re watching something else. Because LCDs 
use a separate backlight instead of creating their own light with phosphors, 
they are immune to this problem (plasmas are not, by the way).
 
 You can get a stuck pixel on an LCD screen, where a single pixel always 
emits a color (often red). This is a rare occurrence, but it can happen. 
Most people don’t even notice it, but if you’re sharp-eyed, it might drive 
you crazy.
 
 Check your TV’s warranty for its policy on stuck pixels. Some manu-
facturers will repair or replace a TV with only a few stuck pixels, while 
others will make you wait until you have dozens of them — which could 
leave you in the lurch with enough stuck pixels to annoy you, but not 
enough to warrant repair (at least not in the manufacturer’s mind) 
before the warranty period is over.
 
 Inherently progressive: Unlike direct-view systems, LCDs don’t dis-
play their picture using electron guns scanning lines across a screen. 
Instead, LCDs use millions of tiny transistors that can be individually 
controlled by the “brains” inside the display. This means that LCDs can 
easily handle progressive-scan sources, such as progressive-scan DVD 
and HDTV — unlike some direct-view systems that simply can’t scan fast 
enough to display progressive video.
Besides the size limitation we discuss earlier in this section, consider a few 
other problem areas before you buy an LCD system as your primary display 
in a home theater:
 
 Slightly more expensive for their size: Inch for viewing inch, LCDs tend 
to be a bit more expensive than the plasma flat-panels we discuss next 
and much more expensive than CRT displays. As we write in mid 2008, 
you can expect to pay about $1000 to $1200 for a 40-inch LCD display. 
For the same price, you could buy a 42-inch plasma set — in other 
words, get a bigger monitor for the same price.

213
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
 
 Poor reproduction of blacks: Compared with direct-view tube displays, 
LCDs do a poor job of reproducing black images. Darker screen images 
never show up as true black, but rather as various shades of gray, and 
actions happening in these darker areas are difficult to discern.
 
 Poor response time: Some LCD displays suffer from a poor response 
time — meaning it takes a while for the pixels to change colors in 
response to a rapidly changing scene in your video program. This can 
bug the living daylights out of some people, particularly when you’re 
watching sports (you might see a trail of a moving ball on the screen, for 
example).
  
 Most new LCD TVs have this problem licked — but look for a response 
time of less than 8 milliseconds.
 
 Limited viewing angle: Although they are getting better due to some 
intensive efforts by manufacturers, LCDs typically have a poor viewing 
angle. If you are not sitting almost directly in front of the screen, you 
don’t get a good picture.
 
 Limited brightness: Because LCDs use a backlight shining through the 
liquid crystal, most of the light is absorbed. As a result, the LCD displays 
have lower contrast and are harder to view in a brightly lit room (the 
picture appears washed out), compared with plasma TVs. LCD TVs with 
LED backlights do better in this regard.
Staying on the cutting edge with plasma
Perhaps the coolest thing to come down the home theater pike in quite some 
time (maybe ever!) is the larger, flat-screen monitor that uses plasma tech-
nology. A plasma TV (often called a PDP, or plasma display panel) contains 
millions of gas-filled cells, or pixels, wedged between two pieces of glass. An 
electrical grid zaps these pixels and causes the gases to ionize (the ionized 
gas is plasma — hence the name). The ionized gases, in turn, cause a layer of 
phosphor on the outside layer of glass to light up (just like the electron gun 
in a CRT causes the phosphor to light up on the front of the tube).
Plasma displays have captured the attention of the home theater industry 
and home theater consumers because of the sheer size and quality of the 
picture they can produce. They’re also known for their compact size. Plasma 
displays are available in 42-, 50-, 56-, and even 65-inch sizes — and they can 
get even bigger. (Panasonic shows off a greater-than-100-inch plasma every 
year at the Consumer Electronics show — don’t even ask about the price!) 
Even at the larger sizes, the display itself is usually no more than 5 or 6 
inches deep — and suitable for wall hanging! All the plasma displays in these 
sizes (which are by far the most common, at least in the U.S. market) have a 
16:9 aspect ratio.

214
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Other benefits of plasma displays include the following:
 
 Excellent brightness: Because plasma displays use the direct lighting of 
phosphors (instead of a backlighting system in LCDs), they can have an 
extremely bright and crisp picture, just like a direct-view CRT TV. In fact, 
because each pixel is controlled directly by the electrical grid behind 
the plasma cells, the brightness tends to be extremely even across the 
screen. In a CRT, the electron guns shoot at the phosphors from differ-
ing angles depending on which part of the screen the gun is creating, 
which can cause uneven brightness in badly designed CRTs.
 
 High resolution: Some early plasmas were not HD-capable, but every 
plasma we know of these days is at least 720p capable. The year 2008 
has brought a flood of 1080p-capable plasmas as well — in the past, LCD 
HDTVs were much more likely to be capable of this resolution than were 
plasmas. Just about all plasma displays on the market are 16:9 aspect 
ratio sets, which is also essential for HDTV viewing.
 
 PC monitor–capable: Like LCD screens, most plasma displays can be 
plugged directly into any PC (not just home theater PCs with special TV 
video cards) to act as a gigantic PC monitor.
 
 No geometric distortion: In a CRT display, the electron guns that shoot 
their beams on the phosphor screen are in a fixed location (the center/
back of the tube). The angle at which these beams hit the phosphor 
varies; in the middle of the screen, the angle is perpendicular, but the 
angle is quite different at the corners of the screen. This changing angle 
can cause geometric distortions in the picture. In a plasma display, 
each gas pocket is at an identical angle (and distance) to the phosphor 
it lights up, so you don’t get distortions around the edge of the picture. 
This benefit is also found in LCD flat panels.
 
 Progressive by nature: Like LCDs, plasma systems don’t use a scanning 
electron beam to create a picture. Instead, all the pixels on the screen 
are lit up simultaneously. So progressive video sources display progres-
sively on any plasma system; you don’t need to buy a special progres-
sive set like you do with CRT displays.
 
 A wide viewing angle: Unlike LCDs, plasma displays have a good 
picture even when you are sitting “off axis” (not perpendicular to the 
screen surface). In a smaller room, where some of the seating might be 
at an acute angle from the screen, the wide viewing angle can be a big 
plus.
Of course, the plasma equation has a few downsides (besides the fact that a 
lot of us can’t afford the $3000 it costs for an HDTV plasma):

215
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
 
 Susceptible to burn-in: Any system that uses a phosphor screen to 
display video can fall victim to the phosphor burn-in mentioned earlier 
in this chapter. If you do a lot of video gaming or stock or news ticker 
viewing, you need to be aware of this fact. Although burn-in can also be 
an issue with a CRT set, it’s an even bigger issue with a plasma, consid-
ering the price. Manufacturers of plasma TVs have made great strides in 
reducing the possibility of burn-in, and many plasma TVs have burn-in 
fix-it programs that generate a series of images onscreen designed to 
remove any minor burn-in from your screen.
 
 You can minimize burn-in on any display by calibrating the set properly 
and by reducing the brightness from its factory setting, which is usually 
too high. We talk about this in Chapter 19.
 
 Shorter life span: Another phenomenon of any phosphor-based display 
system is that eventually the phosphors “wear out” or lose their bright-
ness. Like burn-in, this degradation also happens to CRT-based direct-
view displays, but it often happens faster with plasma displays. Given 
the considerably higher cost of a plasma, your cost per hour of viewing 
is much higher. Before you buy, check the manufacturer’s specifica-
tions on hours to half brightness, which is the point at which the display 
is only half as bright as it was when new. For example, if this specifica-
tion is 20,000 hours, and you watch the set for 6 hours a day, it will be 
effectively worn out in about 9 years. If you have kids, keep in mind that 
6 hours a day is not an excessive estimate for how long the television 
may be turned on every day. Also keep in mind that while LCDs may not 
expire quite as quickly as a plasma TV will, they do have backlight sys-
tems that can burn out or dim over time.
 
 Not as high resolution as LCD: Even though 1080p plasmas are becom-
ing more and more common, the majority of mainstream plasma TVs 
offer “only” 720p resolution. We suspect that within a year or two, just 
about all plasmas, at least those 50 inches and larger, will be 1080p, but 
today that’s just not the case.
 
 Unless you have exceptional eyesight, watch a lot of 1080p content (on 
Blu-ray discs), and sit close to your flat-panel TV (less than 1.5 times 
the screen size), the 720p versus 1080p thing isn’t as much of a big deal 
as many make it out to be. Remember, all things being equal, 1080p is 
better than 720p. But all things are never equal, and most folks simply 
can not see the difference from a typical viewing distance.
 
 Poor reproduction of black: Although plasma displays are an equal to 
good old-fashioned CRT sets in terms of absolute brightness, they fall 
short in the contrast ratio comparison, though they are typically better 
in this regard than LCDs. Like LCDs, plasma displays have a hard time 
reproducing black, so black scenes end up being reproduced as shades 
of gray.

216
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
We think that these shortcomings are far from fatal. We love plasma displays, 
but we realize that they aren’t for everyone. In many home theaters, perhaps 
the biggest factor supporting the plasma display (besides the undeniable 
wow factor every time you look at one in action) is their amazing compact-
ness relative to screen size.
An acronym in the industry, SAF (spousal acceptance factor), absolutely 
applies to the plasma display. (Actually, the term is WAF, but we’re being 
politically correct here.) If your spouse isn’t into the concept of a home the-
ater and hates the idea of a huge TV cluttering the family or living room, a 
plasma may be your home theater salvation. You don’t even have to tell him 
or her you wanted one anyway because of the awesome picture. Grumble a 
little and get some brownie points out of your purchase!
Getting Into Projection TVs
When you go to the movies, the images you see are projected onto that big 
screen in front of you. If size matters to you (and if you have the room in your 
home theater — and seats far enough away from the screen), you too should 
consider a projector for your home theater’s display system. Even if size 
isn’t a huge deal to you, you may decide to go with a front-projection system 
because it can offer the ultimate in home theater image quality.
In this section, we talk about the two types of projectors available for home 
theater: all-in-one rear-projection systems and movie projector–like front-
projection systems. We also talk about the different kinds of projector systems 
found in both front and rear projectors. And, finally, we get into the choices 
you’ll find for separate screens (needed if you buy a front-projection system).
For many home theater enthusiasts, a theater isn’t really a theater unless 
you have a projector. Until the advent of the plasma and LCD flat panel (dis-
cussed in the preceding section), projectors were the only choice for big 
screens (bigger than the approximately 40-inch limit of CRT direct-view TVs, 
at least). And while 65-inch plasmas are now on the market, you still need a 
projector system to get a really big picture. (Front-projection screens can be 
as big as 10 feet or more across!)
But projection systems don’t need to break the bank either. Rear-projection 
systems (RPTVs) are perhaps the best value in home theater, at least in 
terms of bang for the buck (or inches per dollar). For about $2500, you can 
get a Full HD 1080p rear-projection system that’s somewhere between 67 
inches and 73 inches. By way of comparison, a 65-inch plasma HDTV costs 
more than $5000.

217
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
You can’t hang one of these units on the wall, but visually the picture is 
at least as good as (and often better than) plasma, for thousands less. In 
particular, RPTVs are much better than most plasma displays at reproduc-
ing blacks onscreen, which means you get superior reproduction of darker 
scenes when you’re watching movies or television.
 
When you want a really big HDTV (like the 68- or 73-inch models we discuss a 
few paragraphs back), a rear-projection system is a great bargain. In the more 
typical 50-inch range, the price benefit of rear-projection TVs over plasma or 
LCD flat panels has pretty much evaporated as manufacturers have increased 
their production of flat-panel systems. You may find the picture quality of a 
rear-projection TV superior in some ways to that of a plasma or LCD, but the 
convenience and sexiness factor of a flat panel outweighs this for most buyers. 
For this reason, many manufacturers have begun to limit their rear-projection 
HDTV production to only the biggest models or end it entirely in favor of flat-
panel TVs. For example, Sony discontinued all rear-projection TVs in 2008 in 
favor of LCD flat panels. Over time we suspect that rear-projection TVs will 
go the way of the tube TV (in other words, rear-projection TVs will be pro-
duced in small numbers by niche manufacturers only), and we’ll see a choice 
between flat panels for small to big displays and front-projection systems for 
really big displays. For now, however, a rear-projection system can still be a 
good choice if you’re looking for the biggest picture at an affordable price.
Going all-in-one
Typically, front-projection displays are the high 
end of the market. Folks considering one of 
these in their theater will often spend $2000 or 
more for the combination of the projector and 
screen. As a result, many people who want to 
spend $1000 or so for a big-screen system will 
choose a rear-projection TV (something we 
recommend). But a new category of projection 
systems on the market turns this formula on its 
head — front-projection displays in an inex-
pensive form that anyone can afford. These 
all-in-one front-projection systems are the dis-
play equivalent of the home-theater-in-a-box 
solutions for audio that we discuss in Chapter 
2. Essentially, they include a DLP-powered 
front projector, a DVD player, and even (in most 
cases) a pair of speakers. They’re no substitute 
for a full home theater system, but they are an 
easy way to get up and running. We think the 
best use for these devices is as a home theater 
solution for the kids’ playroom, your vacation 
home, or anywhere besides your true home the-
ater. They’re also great for gamers — plug in an 
Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, shine the projector 
on the wall, and you’re ready for some truly big-
screen Halo or Gran Turismo action! They’re 
also a wonderfully convenient solution for an 
outdoor drive-in theater in your back yard. 
None of these all-in-one systems supports 
HDTV resolutions (though we expect that newer 
versions will), but you get a lot for your money 
(typically just a shade more than $1000). Check 
out Optoma’s DV-11 ($899 list price) for a good 
example of this type of system.

218
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Choosing between front 
and rear projection
The first big decision to make when evaluating projection systems is a big 
one: should you choose an all-in-one rear-projection TV or a two-part front 
projector and screen system? This used to be an easy decision — rear-
projection systems were cheaper and easier to set up. But that’s changing 
as the price of high-definition projectors drops precipitously (you can get a 
good-quality 720p projector for under $1000 and a 1080p projector for about 
$2000) and as front projectors have become easier to set up.
 
Although a rear-projection system remains easier and more convenient, we 
urge you to at least consider a front-projection system if you want a truly big-
screen home theater. For the price of a 56-inch plasma TV or a 72-inch rear-
projection TV, you could get a front-projection system capable of pictures 
measured in the hundreds of inches!
Having said that, let’s define the difference between these systems. It’s 
simple, really:
 
 Front projection: A front projector is very similar to a movie projector 
(except it doesn’t use film). It includes a projector unit (which is usually 
mounted on your ceiling but can also be on a lift, on a floor mount, or 
in the rear wall) and a separate screen. Video sources (such as DVDs, 
cable, and satellite TV) are routed into the projector, which then turns 
these signals into light. Then, the light is (ding ding ding, you guessed it) 
projected onto a separate screen that’s mounted on a wall at the front of 
your home theater. Figure 14-2 shows a front-projection system.
 
Figure 14-2: 
A front-
projection 
system.
 

219
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
 
 Rear projection: These are the traditional big-screen TVs that have been 
sold for years and years. If your Uncle Vinnie got a big screen back in 
1987 for Superbowl XXI, this is what he has. Now some people, having 
seen the lousy, washed-out picture on Uncle Vinnie’s TV, think that rear 
projectors trade picture quality for size. Nothing can be further from the 
truth. A good-quality, well-set-up rear projector can offer an awesome 
picture. A rear-projection TV (or RPTV) has both parts of the front pro-
jector (the projector and the screen) in a single, all-in-one box, and the 
projector illuminates the back of the screen instead of the front. Figure 
14-3 shows a rear-projection system.
 
Figure 14-3: 
The all-in-
one rear-
projection 
system.
 
 
RPTVs are great. But they do have two limitations: a restricted viewing angle 
and size. Because of the way video is internally reflected toward the screen 
in these sets, you need to be perpendicular (or near-perpendicular) to the 
display to see a good picture. Keep that limitation in mind as you consider an 
RPTV. If your home theater room is set up with widely dispersed seating, an 
RPTV may not be your best choice. Also, rear-projection TVs can be very deep 
and overwhelm a room with their size. For some, this is a limitation.

220
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
If you have a really big room and can keep it dark enough to use a front-
projection system, front projection is the way to get that truly movie theater–
sized picture. But the dark room is a major must to get the most out of a 
front-projection system. Don’t think you can set up a front projector in your 
family room (you know, the room with the picture window on one wall and 
the sliding glass door on the other — oh yeah, and the skylight too!) and get a 
good picture. You can, but only if you spend a lot of time and effort blocking 
out the light. You need a dark room to get the most out of front projection — 
that’s why we recommend rear-projection systems for the average home the-
ater builder who doesn’t have a dedicated room and who wants to be able to 
watch TV in broad daylight.
 
It may sound obvious, but don’t forget that you’ll need an unimpeded path 
between the projector and the screen in a front-projection system. Unless 
you’re just a huge fan of MST3k (www.mst3kinfo.org) and want to see a 
person’s head silhouetted on the screen, you’ll need to be able to keep the air 
between your projector and screen clear of all objects.
As we mentioned, the lower cost and easier setup make rear projectors more 
consumer-friendly. (You don’t have to spend nearly as much time getting 
the projector properly aligned and aimed at the screen with a rear projec-
tor.) But with the advent of new, computer-based technologies such as DLP 
(Digital Light Processor) chips, front projectors have begun to drop in price 
from the stratospheric ($20,000 to $60,000) to the reasonable (under $1000), 
and the setup of these new systems is easier, too (which we explain in a 
minute). Rather than take up your valuable reading time with a long-winded 
description of the relative benefits and shortcomings of these two types of 
projectors, we’ve created the handy-dandy Table 14-1 to enlighten, educate, 
and energize the home theater portion of your brain.

 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
Selecting a projection method
As you move past the rear- versus front-projection decision, you’ll find that 
you really haven’t decided anything at all. Three main digital projection tech-
nologies currently on the market do the work of converting electrical video 
source signals into light that can be projected onto the screen. Each of these 
technologies can be found in either front-projection or rear-projection units. 
Keep in mind, however, that new variants of these technologies, as well as 
entirely new ways of projecting video, are being invented all the time.
Projecting with LCDs
LCD technologies have been used for years and years for relatively low-
quality projectors — the kind you might have in the conference room at work 
for projecting those ubiquitous PowerPoint slides on the white board during 
Another place where the CRT has disappeared
Less than a decade ago, almost all front- and 
rear-projection TVs used cathode ray tubes 
(CRTs) just as most TVs were tube-based. In 
the case of a projection system, three sepa-
rate tubes (red, green and blue) were installed 
inside the projector and aimed at the screen 
(on the wall or, using a mirror, on the front of a 
rear-projection system) in such a way that the 
image from each tube aligned to perfectly over-
lap each other.
CRT projection systems were capable of 
extraordinary image quality (particularly the 
front-projection systems), but they had a few 
drawbacks: 
  They were finicky. Keeping those three 
tubes aligned required a lot of work, often 
from service professionals. If you ever saw 
a projection TV with green, red, or blue 
“shadows” around images on the screen, 
you saw a misaligned CRT projector.
  They didn’t put out a lot of light. To get the 
best picture from a CRT projector (particu-
larly front projectors) you needed a very 
dark room. Today’s digital projectors don’t 
rely on the light being emitted by a phos-
phor panel, but instead have a very power-
ful lamp that can put out several times as 
much light as a set of CRTs.
  They were expensive to build well. High-
quality, CRT front-projection systems rou-
tinely cost $20,000 (or more!).
  They were big and bulky. Even though the 
tubes were small (compared to the tube 
in a direct-view CRT TV) they were gigan-
tic compared to the chips used in today’s 
digital projection systems. Remember that 
gigantic projection TV that took up half of 
Uncle Ernie’s family room? Yep, it was a 
CRT.
Today, we don’t know of any manufacturers 
who still make CRT projection systems. If you 
dig around, you can still find someone some-
where making one, but all mainstream TV man-
ufacturers have dropped CRT in favor of digital 
projection systems.

mind-numbingly boring meetings. (Of course, we feel obliged to say that none 
of our clients ever show us mind-numbingly boring PowerPoints, nor are the 
PowerPoints we show our clients mind-numbingly boring!)
Well, the LCD has come of age in the era of home theater, and now you can 
buy front-projection systems based on the LCD that provide a high-quality 
(often HDTV) picture at a price that is typically lower than that of CRT front-
projection systems. (Note that LCD RPTVs aren’t much cheaper than CRT 
RPTVs and may even cost more, simply because the small tubes used in 
RPTVs are dirt cheap.)
LCD projectors typically use three small LCD panels (a couple of inches 
across at most) — one each for red, green, and blue picture information. 
Behind these panel is a strong lamp that provides the light. Like plasma and 
LCD flat panels, LCDs (and the DLP and LCoS projectors we discuss next) are 
fixed-pixel displays, meaning that they display video at a certain resolution. 
You can find high-definition LCD-projection TVs with both 720p and 1080p 
resolutions. An internal device called an image scaler converts the incom-
ing signal (such as 480p from progressive-scan DVDs or 1080i from an HDTV 
broadcast) to the 1366 x 768 resolution for display. LCD projectors are inher-
ently progressive, so even standard-definition broadcasts are converted to a 
progressive-scan mode for display.
 
Some of the cheapest projectors are not high definition, with resolutions 
below 720p. (These are mainly front-projection systems; all rear projection-
LCD TVs we know of are HD-capable.) These are fine for certain uses (see the 
sidebar titled “Going all-in-one” for a discussion of some of these projectors 
and where we think they make perfect sense), but with high-quality 720p pro-
jectors from major manufacturers such as Sony and Panasonic going for less 
than $1000, we see no reason not to choose HD when you’re buying an LCD 
projector. And in the case of front-projection systems, where you’re going to 
be looking at a 100-inch or bigger screen, we strongly recommend that you go 
for a Full HD 1080p projector if your budget can stretch the extra thousand 
dollars or so.
 
The quality of the image scaler — how well it converts other signals to the 
fixed-pixel resolution native to the LCD — is a key factor in a projector’s 
picture quality. In Chapter 21, we talk about external image scalers that can 
improve the picture quality of a projection system.
Because you never know who’ll come up with a better system the month 
after this book is printed, we generally avoid dropping brand name recom-
mendations. However, we find that scalers from Faroudja (now owned by 
Genesis Microchip — www.gnss.com) are always excellent. You can find 
many different brands of projectors (and HDTVs in general) that use Faroudja 
chips (notably the DCDI chip) to scale, or upconvert, images.

223
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
LCD projector systems have several big advantages, when compared with 
other projectors:
 
 Lower-cost front projectors: You can buy a quality 720p LCD front pro-
jector for less than $1000.
 
 More compact RPTVs: Because the LCD panels and the lamp are small, 
LCD RPTVs can be much thinner than CRT RPTVs. Although many CRT 
systems can be 36 inches or more deep, LCD systems can be less than 
15 inches deep. That helps a lot both in small rooms and with the SAF 
(spousal acceptance factor).
 
 Bright pictures: The separate lamp used in LCD projectors puts out a 
ton of light. (You wouldn’t want to have someone shine one in your eyes 
close up!) The result is a brighter picture that can tolerate more ambient 
light in your home theater.
 
 For the best brightness and color reproduction, look for LCD projectors 
(typically only RPTVs) that use LED backlights instead of traditional 
bulbs.
 
 No need for convergence: Despite the fact that an LCD projector con-
tains three LCD panels, it has only one light source. So you don’t need 
to converge the picture like you had to do with the older CRT projector 
technology. This makes the setup much easier for mere mortals.
 
 No worries about burn-in: Plug in that Xbox or PlayStation and play all 
the games you want. Because LCD systems don’t use phosphors, they 
can’t get permanent burn-in like CRTs (or flat-panel plasma systems) can.
Of course, there’s got to be a downside, right? LCD projectors don’t do a few 
things well:
 
 Relatively poor black performance: LCD projectors, like LCD direct-
view sets, can’t display true black tints well. Dark scenes end up being 
gray instead. So when the Orcs are sneaking up on Frodo from the 
mouth of that dark cave, you can’t see them all that well.
 
 Short lamp life: Nothing lasts forever, and the high-output lamps on LCD 
projectors tend to wear out after a few thousand hours of use. This life span 
is much less than the life span of a plasma TV, but LCD projector lamps 
cost a lot less to replace (hundreds instead of thousands of dollars).
 
 “Stuck pixels” problem: If you own a laptop computer (or a desktop 
computer with an LCD display), you may be familiar with the issue of 
stuck pixels. These are usually minor manufacturing defects that cause 
individual pixels to not light up when the display tells them to. Because 
the relative size of pixels in a projection system is large, you may notice 
a dead pixel on your screen (and be annoyed by it). Many manufactur-
ers think that having a few stuck pixels is just part of doing business, 
and they will not replace your LCD panels except in extreme cases. As a 
result, it is a good idea to find out the manufacturer’s dead pixel policy 
before you buy.

224
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
 “Screen door”: When LCD images are projected onto big screens (like 
the ones you find in a front-projector system), you can begin to see the 
pixel structure of the LCD itself. By this we mean the physical structure 
of the LCD that separates the individual pixels. Because of the way LCDs 
are constructed, you can look closely at a large projected image and 
see dots of lighter and darker areas — like you’re looking at the world 
through a metal screen door. We should emphasize that this isn’t a huge 
issue. This “screen door” effect is typically noticeable only if you’re too 
close to a big image.

systems.
Deciding on a DLP
Texas Instruments has developed (over the course of many years) a com-
pletely new way of projecting video called the DLP, or Digital Light Processor. 
DLP has created a new category of inexpensive projector systems and has 
also led to a digital revolution in those old-fashioned movie theaters you 
used to go to before you got a home theater. In fact, if your movie theater 
talks about its “digital projection,” you’ve already seen DLP (a super-high-
end, expensive version) in action.
The DLP is an entirely digital process that utilizes a semiconductor generi-
cally called the DMD (digital micromirror device). The DMD contains over a 
million incredibly tiny, hinged mirrors. Each of these mirrors represents a 
single pixel on your video image. The DLP chip’s electronic logic controls 
the hinges on the mirrors, turning them so that they either reflect light (onto 
your screen) or block it (creating a dark spot on the screen). When the DLP’s 
“brains” turn these mirrors on and off, the mirrors create different levels of 
light between black and white that result in a grayscale version of your image. 
A device called a color wheel filters light from a lamp (like the lamps found in 
LCD projectors), reflects this off the mirrors on the DLP chip, and provides 
the color in your image. This is a Mach III fly-by of the details of DLP; if you 
want to know the nitty-gritty, check out the Texas Instruments site at www.
dlp.com.
 
The DLP system we just described, with the color wheel, is called a single-chip 
DLP solution and is by far the most common in consumer DLP projectors. 
Movie theater projectors (and a few ultra-expensive home theater models) 
dispense with the color wheel and use three DLP chips (one for red, one for 
green, and one for blue). These three-chip projectors can produce more gra-
dations of color than a single-chip system but cost a heck of a lot more.

225
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
When looking at DLP projectors, the most important factor to consider is 
the capabilities of the DLP chip, which is the heart of the system. Like LCDs, 
DLPs are fixed-pixel displays, and Texas Instruments has a few chips on 
the market with different aspect ratios and different resolutions. Early DLP 
chips were designed for 4:3 video reproduction (with a lower-resolution 16:9 
mode), but current models are designed for 16:9 aspect ratios.
Most DLP systems for home theater solutions (for both front- and rear-
projection TVs) offer a Full HD 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1920 x 1080 pixel 
resolution, but there are still some DLP projectors with lower, non-HD reso-
lutions. These chips are typically used in business projectors (those ubiqui-
tous PowerPoints at the boring meeting again) and not for home theater.
 
As is the case with LCD projection systems (and with LCoS, which we discuss 
in the next section), we strongly recommend that you consider a 1080p-
capable system if you’re using a front projector with a large screen.
DLP projectors share many of the advantages of LCD models: low price, 
compact size (with particularly thin RPTVs possible), and immunity from 
image burn-in. They also share what many find to be the biggest of the same 
drawbacks: less-than-perfect reproduction of blacks (but better than most 
LCD projectors). However, DLPs don’t have the “screen door” issue we men-
tioned earlier and, additionally, have one big advantage over the other types 
of projectors we’ve discussed so far: They are brighter and therefore better 
in rooms that aren’t too dark. In a DLP chip, light from the lamp is reflected 
off the mirrors, but in an LCD, light is transmitted through the liquid crystals, 
which causes a decrease in brightness.
Weebles wobble
Texas Instruments got together with computer/
technology behemoth Hewlett Packard and 
incorporated one of HP’s technologies into 
some of its DLP chips. Called wobbulation, this 
technology allows each of the individual mir-
rors within a DLP chip to address (or beam its 
reflected light at) two different pixels. What this 
does is allow a chip with a resolution of 960 x 
1080 to effectively have a resolution of 1920 x 
1080 (the full resolution of 1080i/p high defini-
tion). TI calls this technology smooth picture.
Many 1080p-capable DLP TVs use this tech-
nology to achieve their full resolution. Nothing 
wrong with that, but testing has found that some 
displays using wobbulation don’t quite achieve 
the full resolution in the real world. The latest 
DLP displays (announced as we write, but not 
yet on the market) will offer true 1080p resolution 
without this wobbulation technique — which 
promises to provide a better picture.

226
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
One issue that some folks have with DLP projectors is something called the 
rainbow effect. During a highly contrasted scene (such as white on a black 
background), some folks can see a shimmery colored image (like a rainbow, 
naturally!) in their peripheral vision. Not everyone can see this, but some 
small percentage of the population sees it and is annoyed (to the point of 
headaches or even dizziness). You can minimize the rainbow effect by choos-
ing a three-chip DLP set with individual DLP chips for red, green, and blue — 
many folks believe that the color wheel in single-chip projectors causes the 
effect.
 
The newest trend in DLP is to use a single chip but to replace the color wheel 
and single light source with three LED light sources (red, blue, and green). This 
helps get rid of the rainbow effect and has the additional benefit of improving 
the color reproduction of the DLP projector. LEDs are cool — we think you’ll 
start seeing them more and more in home theater displays (as well as in every-
day objects such as flashlights, car headlights, and other lighting systems). 
They have the advantage, when compared with incandescent lighting, of truer 
colors, lower energy consumption, and greatly increased life spans.
 
We love the future of DLP projectors (both front and rear). They have great 
pictures, are relatively inexpensive, and are a snap to set up. As the technol-
ogy matures, we think this may end up being the predominant projection 
system of the future — already more than 75 manufacturers use the technol-
ogy in their projector systems. Given the nature of the microprocessor busi-
ness, we think that DLP chips will get much cheaper and much more capable 
faster than you can bat an eye. You can already buy a good-quality HDTV-
ready front-projection DLP system for less than $1000.
Looking at LCoS
Another “projector-on-a-chip” system that has hit the market in recent years 
is the LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon) system. Several manufacturers are 
making LCoS systems, but the most prominent to date have been JVC, with 
a system called D-ILA (Digital Direct Drive Image Light Amplifier) — we’re 
puzzled by the acronym, but we guess DDDILA is too hard to remember — 
and Sony, with its SXRD (Silicon Crystal X-tal — for acronym purposes — 
Reflective Display) projection TVs.
LCoS systems are basically a new variant of LCDs. LCoS systems still use 
liquid crystals, but instead of transmitting light through the liquid crystal 
like an LCD does, LCoS reflects the light like a DLP, resulting in a significantly 
brighter image.
There are only a few manufacturers of LCoS-projection systems, but those 
that are available — that is to say, JVC’s D-ILA models, Sony’s SXRD models, 
and a few others — have perhaps the finest picture quality of any projection 
displays available.

227
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
LCoS systems offer true 1080p resolution (with no tricks like the wobbulation 
we discuss in the “Weebles wobble” sidebar) and an incredibly smooth, film-
like image. LCoS beats out LCD-projection systems in the brightness game, 
while avoiding the rainbow effects found in DLPs.
LCoS is also known for exceptional black reproduction that rivals, if not quite 
matches, the blacks displayed by the super-expensive CRT projection sys-
tems that used to be the high end of the market.
What’s the catch? Well, LCoS projectors are more expensive than LCD or DLP 
projectors — there simply isn’t the kind of volume production of the LCoS 
microdisplay components to bring the prices down to those levels yet. You 
can expect to pay about 25 percent more for a 1080p LCoS display than you 
would for an identically-sized DLP display.
 
The good news here is that the prices are coming down rapidly. For example, 
Sony’s first generation of SXRD RPTVs cost about twice what similar-sized DLP 
projectors cost at the time. The models shipping as we write (less than a year 
into the technology’s life span) are only about $500 more than a similar DLP 
and offer a better picture. So keep your eye on LCoS, because it may very well 
give DLP a run for its (and your) money!
Keeping other features in mind
Regardless of technology, keep in mind a few other things when evaluating 
projection systems:
 
 Fixed versus variable focal length (front projectors only): Some front-
projection systems (including many fancy CRT models) have what’s 
known as a fixed focal length. This means that, for a given screen size, 
the projector must be placed a fixed and predetermined distance away. 
This can limit your placement in the room. If a heating duct on the ceil-
ing is right where the projector needs to be, that’s too bad. Projectors 
with variable focal length can be placed in different spots to fit your 
room’s layout and then adjusted to focus on the screen properly.
 
 Light output (front-projection only): We’ve already discussed the vari-
ous projector types with regards to their relative brightness. But within 
these categories, projectors vary from model to model in their overall 
brightness. This is measured in ANSI lumens and is a good indicator of 
how well a system will work in a bright room. Brighter, high-end projec-
tors are often rated at 1,000 or more lumens, whereas cheaper ones are 
often below 500. We don’t recommend that you use any projector in a 
brightly lit room, but if you simply can’t make the room dark, go for a 
brighter unit.

228
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
 Just because you can crank your amp up to 11 doesn’t mean that you 
should. (Please excuse the shameless, pop culture, Spinal Tap refer-
ence.) The brightest setting your projector supports may cut through 
the daylight streaming in your windows, but it won’t give you the best 
picture you can get. In Chapter 19, we talk about how to set your bright-
ness settings (and a bunch of other settings) on your display.
 
 Aspect ratio: In the RPTV world, systems have a fixed aspect ratio. 
They’re either 4:3 (standard squarish TV) or 16:9 (widescreen). We 
recommend that you get the widescreen version unless all you watch is 
Leave It to Beaver reruns. Some front projectors also have a fixed native 
aspect ratio, but many systems can be adjusted to work at either aspect 
ratio. If you don’t have a choice, go with the widescreen, and if you pick 
a system with an adjustable aspect ratio, enjoy it!
 
 Projector noise: Many front-projection TVs employ a cooling fan — 
particularly LCD and DLP systems, which need bright (and hot!) lamps 
to create the picture. DLP systems may also make an audible noise 
when the color wheel spins. In a small room, you may hear these noises, 
which can be annoying. Try to audition your projector in your dealer’s 
showroom and pay attention to the noise it makes. You have to live with 
it after you buy it!
 
 Everything we discuss in Chapter 13: This is our convenient catchall 
category. In Chapter 13, we list a ton of things to consider when evaluat-
ing a display system, such as the number of inputs and the adjustabil-
ity of the system. We don’t feel like repeating ourselves, and we don’t 
like typing that much (or even cutting and pasting!) either. So go read 
Chapter 13 because it all applies here, too.
Selecting your silver screen
As they say in the ginsu knife ads, “But wait, there’s more!” We’ve talked 
about the projectors themselves, but in the case of front-projection systems, 
we’ve talked about only half the equation. You gotta shine that nice, high-def 
image onto something, and we definitely don’t recommend an old bedsheet 
or the wall. You need a real screen — just like a movie theater.
Screens come in several different forms:
 
 Portable screens that sit on a tripod: You can fold these up and put 
them away when you’re done (but who’s ever done with a home the-
ater?). These are less than optimal (if you take them down, you need to 
get them back in exactly the same spot or refocus the projector — if it 
can even be focused!). We don’t recommend these at all.

229
 Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies 
 
 Retractable screens: These can be manually or electrically powered. 
Although nothing is cooler than pressing a button on the remote and 
having the screen come down, this setup will cost you more than the 
manual version. You also need to make sure that these systems are 
properly installed so that they are flat (otherwise the image can be dis-
torted), and periodically check to make sure they haven’t become mis-
aligned with use.
 
 Fixed wall- and ceiling-mounted screens: If you have a dedicated home 
theater and you’ll never want to hide the screen, these are probably the 
best way to go.
Even more important than the form are the technical characteristics of the 
screen. The big four are the following:
 
 Gain: Gain is a measure of how reflective the screen is — how much of 
the projector’s light gets bounced back to your eyeballs. There’s a stan-
dard industry reference for gain, and systems that have exactly as much 
gain as that reference are rated at a gain of 1. More-reflective (high-gain) 
screens are rated greater than 1 (say 1.2), while less-reflective (low-gain) 
screens are rated below 1 (many are rated at 0.8). Generally speaking, 
match CRT projectors with high-gain screens (between 1 and 1.3, though 
you can go higher if needed). Brighter, fixed-pixel systems such as LCD 
or DLP can use a low-gain screen (0.8 or lower).
 
 Viewing angle: Most display systems have a limited angle (from perpen-
dicular) in which they look best. Sit outside that angle, and the picture 
becomes dim. For front-projector screens, this viewing angle is inversely 
proportional to gain. In other words, the higher the gain, the smaller the 
angle in which viewers will get a good picture. For this reason, you are 
best off choosing the lowest gain screen that works with your projector 
in your room. This is why low-gain screens are recommended for fixed-
pixel projectors; LCD, DLP, and LCoS projectors have light to spare, so 
why not trade some of it for a wider viewing angle? Viewing angles are 
usually listed in a number of degrees (such as 90). Your viewing angle is 
half this amount (45, in this case) on either side of perpendicular.
 
 Hotspotting: One reason you shouldn’t use a screen with too high a gain 
for your projector is the hotspotting phenomenon. When this occurs, one 
part of the screen is brighter than the other parts. Typically, the center 
of the screen gets too bright relative to the edges, which makes the pic-
ture on the edges appear washed out.
 
 Aspect ratio: Screens are available in either the 16:9 widescreen or 4:3 
aspect ratio. You should choose the same aspect ratio as that of your 
projector. You can buy (or make your own, if you’re crafty) masks to 
cover the unlit portions of the screen when you’re watching material of 
a different aspect ratio, so you can cover the sides of the screen with a 
mask when you’re watching a 4:3 TV show (more Leave It to Beaver?) on 
your 16:9 screen.

230
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Choosing a screen is not something for the faint of heart. Find out what 
screens your projector manufacturer recommends, ask your dealer what he 
or she recommends, and if at all possible, look at your projector (or the iden-
tical model) on the screen before you buy.
The three major manufacturers of screens for front-projection displays are 
Da-Lite (www.da-lite.com), Draper (www.draperinc.com), and Stewart 
Filmscreen (www.stewartfilmscreen.com).

Remote Controlling Your 
Home Theater
In This Chapter
 Controlling your home theater from your couch
 Checking out types of remote controls
 Understanding remote control features you might want
 Using your PDA as a remote
R
emote controls have come a long way since the first clunky universal 
remote controls let you manipulate multiple devices from one gadget. 
Today, you have all sorts of options: tiny, large, color, touch-sensitive, voice-
controlled, time-controlled, and on and on. You can spend $19 on a great 
remote or $5000 on a “gold-plated” touch-screen, whole-home remote control 
that not only controls all the devices in your home theater but also runs all 
the electronics in your home. Decisions, decisions.
Sifting through Remote Control Options
The remote control is nothing more than a means to tell your system what to 
do. The term remote just means you don’t control your home theater equip-
ment manually (by getting up and pushing buttons). Just to show that we all 
can be as high-tech as the next guy, let’s treat the remote control as an inter-
face, and say that you can interface with your system in multiple ways.
Types of remotes
Hundreds upon hundreds of remotes are out there. Generically, they fall into 
the following categories, which are presented in increasing order of function-
ality and desirability:

232
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
 Standard/dedicated remotes: These are the device-specific remotes 
that come with your system. If you stopped here, you might have ten or 
so remotes on your coffee table!
 
 Brand-based remotes that come with a component: Brand-based 
remotes work with all sorts of devices from the same manufacturer. For 
instance, the Panasonic remote you get with a Panasonic home theater 
receiver usually has buttons for your Panasonic, Blu-ray disc player 
and your Panasonic plasma TV. There are buttons for each supported 
device.
 
 A number of branded remotes that come with devices can be pro-
grammed (by inputting codes) just like the universal remotes discussed 
next. You’ll also find universal remotes included with devices such as 
cable set-top boxes that you rent or buy from your television provider.
 
 Third-party universal remote controls: Many leading electronics brands 
sell so-called universal remote controls. These remotes supposedly 
work with any electronics device by way of onboard code databases. 
These remotes generally come with manuals that walk you through set-
ting up your remote for your specific components. This environment 
is ever-changing, however, and we’ve found that you get what you pay 
for. We’ve never been happy with cheap universal remotes (like the $20 
do-everything universal remotes you see at the megasize electronics 
stores). Some capability is always missing. We prefer the slightly more 
expensive learning remotes.
 
 Typical universal remotes come with a booklet full of codes. To get the 
remote to work with your specific gear, you usually need to look in this 
book, find the type of component (say, DVD player), and then the brand. 
When you find the brand name, you’ll see a number of codes (usually 
4-digit numbers) — follow the directions with your remote to enter 
these codes. You usually have to press a button to put the remote in 
programming mode. You enter the first code on the list — if it works, 
you’re done; if not, you need to go through each of the codes listed until 
the remote starts to interact with your chosen device. Tedious, but 
doable.
 
 Learning remotes: Learning remotes can learn codes from your exist-
ing remote controls. You simply point your remotes at each other, go 
through a listing of commands, and the remote codes are transferred 
from one to the other. These remotes have a higher success rate than 
universal remotes because you are essentially using the same codes 
as your present remote — not codes that a database says should work. 
Some learning remotes have an onboard, preprogrammed database 
against which they try to match the codes being learned; others are 
completely learning-based. The downside of a completely learning-based 
remote is that, if you lose your original remote, it’s almost impossible to 
train this one.

233
 Chapter 15: Remote Controlling Your Home Theater 
 
 Programmable remotes: Programmable remotes allow you to create 
macros, which are sequential code combinations that do a lot of things at 
once. So say you want to watch a movie on a DVD. You could program a 
macro to turn on your TV, receiver, and DVD player; set the receiver to the 
appropriate source and output modes; and start the DVD in the tray — all 
from one button. Now, if it could only pop the popcorn, too.
 
 Proprietary systems: A number of closed-system control devices enable 
you to integrate control of all your home theater devices on a single con-
trol system. Companies such as Control4 (www.nilesaudio.com) and 
Crestron (www.control4.com) are renowned for their control systems.
Remote control features
As simple as a remote control seems to be, the world of remotes is insanely 
complex. This section discusses some ways in which remotes have become 
more complex lately.
Radio frequency (RF) versus infrared (IR)
It used to be that all remotes were infrared-based. Now, many are touting RF 
connectivity, which is in many ways better than IR. First, RF signals tend to 
travel farther than IR. Second, you don’t need to point the remote at the TV 
set; RF can go in all directions, even through walls and cabinet doors. The 
biggest downside of RF remotes is that you can’t easily integrate them into 
one remote (such as a learning remote) — at least not yet. Still, we prefer RF 
to IR if we can get it.
 
The only real downside of RF remotes is the possibility that you could unin-
tentionally control devices in other rooms. In the vast majority of cases, you 
won’t run into this issue, because those other devices won’t be using the same 
remote codes as the ones in your home theater room.
 
Most home theater equipment uses an IR remote control system, so if you use 
an RF system, you need some equipment to convert the RF signals to IR to 
control these IR-only devices. We talk about how to do this in Chapter 18.
Touch-screen displays
Color and grayscale displays are replacing hard buttons on remotes, enabling 
them to be far more programmable and customizable for your system. It’s 
not unusual that your remote would connect to your PC to customize the 
“soft buttons” on your remote’s screen. We are finding that standalone touch 
screens are even replacing remotes.

234
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
New control options
A lot of new stuff is coming down the pike, but we think two-way operation 
and voice control are innovations that will grow in popularity. With two-
way operation, higher-end remotes can interact with the controlled unit to 
determine its state. So, for instance, if a unit is already on, your programmed 
macro won’t turn it off at the start of its session. And with two-way operation, 
you can check your actions to make sure they were carried out.
Nice, but not earth-shaking enough in its newness for you? Then try voice 
control, which lets you bark orders to your remote control (and even to 
other microphones in your home theater). Want the volume turned up? No 
problem: “Higher volume please.” (Have we reached a new threshold when 
a couch potato doesn’t even have to lift a thumb?) Voice-control functional-
ity is making its way into a lot of devices, including standalone Web tablets, 
making voice control a key future item in your home theater.
Another interesting innovation is the docking cradle. A cradle might enable 
your remote to charge, to access the Internet for revised programming 
schedules, or to update its internal code databases. (We think docking 
cradles are really a covert plot to make sure you always know where your 
remote is located.)
IR (infrared) emitters/blasters
When one IR device wants to control another device, it often sends signals 
to the other device’s IR port through an IR blaster — a small device that sits 
some distance from (or in the instance of very small versions called emitters, 
is taped to) the IR port. Many PC applications interface with your home the-
ater system through an IR blaster, to do things such as change the channel 
on your satellite receiver to start recording a program. You might find you 
have several IR blasters for different devices in your system. No one feels 
that this is the best long-term approach because newer devices allow for 
direct data interface via Ethernet, low-speed data connections, or even RF. 
But for now, IR blasters are the only option for many older systems.
 
Within specific brands of A/V gear, you will find IR ports for interconnect-
ing and sharing IR data directly into the motherboard — bypassing the IR 
port. This is one of the benefits of using a single manufacturer for your gear. 
Examples include systems such as Sony’s S-Link, which uses a special cable to 
connect Sony devices to each other.
For the rest of this chapter, we focus on some of the highlights of this 
section — the things that we think you’ll likely run into or want to have.

235
 Chapter 15: Remote Controlling Your Home Theater 
Going Universal
Universal remotes are constantly changing and vary in price from about $20 
on up. They can have backlit buttons, touch screens, color screens, voice 
commands, and so on. A lot of it depends on what you want out of a remote 
control. The more you spend on your entertainment system, the more you’ll 
probably spend on your remote control.
Here are examples of some of the neater remotes you can get:
 
 Universal RF-10 ($59, www.universalremotes.com): This remote 
includes both IR and RF technologies in a single inexpensive universal and 
programmable remote. While it lacks some of the fancy features (such 
as elaborate macros and PC or Mac programming) of more expensive 
remotes, it’s about the cheapest remote you can buy that can support RF. 
To get the RF working, you need to spend another $59 on Universal’s MRF-
100B PowerBlaster RF Base Station, which provides RF-to-IR capability 
supporting up to six devices with included IR emitters.
 
 You don’t need to utilize the RF to get the most out of the RF-10, but it’s 
a good bit of futureproofing in case you’d ever like to move your home 
theater around and need an RF remote.
 
 One For All Universal Remotes ($various prices, www.oneforall-na.
com): The One for All remote line is so vast we couldn’t choose just one 
remote, but suffice it to say that this is a brand with a remote for every-
one, ranging from inexpensive remotes for simple systems (code-based 
universal remotes such as the $20 8-DEVICE Learning Universal Remote) 
up to the still inexpensive $50 URC-9960 Kamelon remote, which uses 
special backlighting to show only the keys you need for the task you’re 
doing at the time.
Remotes for the rest of the family
Got kids? Try the weemote from Fobis ($24.95, 
www.weemote.com). This is a remote 
designed for three- to eight-year-olds, so you 
can limit the channels they watch and make 
them responsible for their own remotes (in 
other words, keep their paws off yours). A typi-
cal setup with a cable-ready TV takes about five 
minutes. Fobis also has a cheaper weemote 
(the weemote dV, $19.95) that’s especially made 
for letting kids navigate interactive components 
of DVDs or digital TV services. There’s even a 
Senior weemote (the weemote SR, $24.95) 
that’s designed for older folks who might not 
have great eyesight or manual dexterity and 
therefore can’t handle the 97 or so buttons on 
the typical universal or learning remote.

236
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
 
 Monster Home Theater Controller 100 ($299, www.monstercable.
com): The folks who bring you the famous (and expensive) Monster 
Cable audio cables have a lineup of very fancy (and very nice) universal 
programmable remote controls. The entry-level model in this lineup, the 
Home Theater Controller 100, has a beautiful color screen, easy com-
puter-based programming, and the ability to control everything in your 
home theater. Like many remotes in this price range, it includes lithium 
ion rechargeable batteries and a cradle to hold and recharge your 
remote. For another $200, the Home Theater Controller 300 includes RF 
capabilities and Omnilink (Monster’s brand name for Z-Wave wireless 
home lighting and automation controls). With that remote you can con-
trol anything in your home theater and just about anything electrical in 
your entire house.
 
 Philips Prestigo line of remotes ($179 to more than $1000, www.
pronto.philips.com): Philips has a solid line of remote controls that 
have defined the leading edge of home theater remotes in a lot of ways. 
The $179 fully programmable and learning Prestigo SRU-8015 is the entry 
level to the Prestigo range, but it has a lot of features, including a big 
(but not color) touch screen, 4MB of memory, a scroll wheel, and the 
ability to program your remote using your PC. It even has a library of 
over 400 TV channel icons, so you can see on the remote exactly what 
channel you’re tuned in to.
 
Many more remotes are available. A great site to check out remote control 
options is Remote Central (www.remotecentral.com). It has great reviews 
and tracks the newest remotes on the market.
You can go universal with your remote in another sense: You can control 
your home theater from anywhere in the home! We talk more about these 
capabilities in Chapter 18.
Programming on Your Remote
We mentioned earlier that remotes are becoming learning-friendly and pro-
grammable. Nothing exemplifies this more than the $249 Logitech Harmony 
One Remote Control (www.logitech.com) shown in Figure 15-1. Harmony 
One, like all Logitech Harmony remotes (and many of those offered by 
Monster Cable, Philips, and others) helps you do more than control differ-
ent devices; it helps you control different actions. Harmony’s remote has an 
LCD touch screen and links to your PC or Mac via a USB connection to pro-
gram the remote to tie together multiple actions at once, in order. The touch 
screen is a big deal at this price — most touch-screen remotes on the market 
cost many times more than Harmony One (but they do have bigger screens 
for that price).

237
 Chapter 15: Remote Controlling Your Home Theater 
 
Figure 15-1: 
Harmony

one of our 
favorites for

our home

Say you want to listen to a CD on your AudioReQuest CD server. You have to 
turn on the TV, set it to video mode, turn on receiver one, set it to CD, turn 
on receiver two, set it to CD, scroll down to your desired playlist, and press 
Play. Harmony reduces this to a simple one-click task. It makes schedules 
and listings available on your remote’s screen, and when you click it, all the 
requisite actions on your CD player, receivers, TV set, and so on are done 
in one quick series of signals from the remote to the devices. So Harmony 
is designed to help you perform activities such as watch TV, play a CD, and 
play a DVD. That’s what we call click and play!
Getting super fancy
A number of manufacturers build touchpad con-
trollers that are not just simple remote controls 
but rather whole-home control systems, which 
let you tap into lighting, HVAC (heating, ventila-
tion, and air conditioning), drapery controls, alarm 
systems, automation systems, and more. An 
example is Crestron (www.crestron.com), 
a company that develops incredibly cool (and 
incredibly expensive) home automation, control, 
and entertainment systems. This is the stuff of 
MTV Cribs that can be found in those $20-million 
dream homes that we all wish to buy when we 
win the lottery. Crestron rules the upper end of 
touch-screen options, as discussed in detail in 
Chapter 23. Crestron’s color touchpad systems 
are to die for, or at least second mortgage for.

238
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
The really cool feature is Logitech’s online configuration tools. Simply plug 
Harmony One into your Mac or PC with the supplied USB cable and go to 
Logitech’s Harmony Web site. As you answer a series of questions onscreen 
about which equipment you are trying to control and how it’s all hooked 
together, the “logic” of your remote’s macros is automatically built for you. 
So you don’t have to laboriously (okay, it’s not labor, but it is a time waster), 
manually program a macro to, for example, “select receiver, select menu, 
down arrow twice, select enter, up arrow once, select enter again,” or what-
ever arcane combination of keystrokes will make your equipment do what 
you want it to do. The Logitech database already “knows” all this and simply 
downloads the right instructions to your remote over the Internet. So you 
just press the “DVD” command, for example, and your remote will tell your 
DVD player, your receiver, your TV, your . . . well, whatever . . . what to do. 
We like it when technology works for us, rather than the other way around.
Harmony is also a learning remote and has, in addition to the touch screen, 
a number of dedicated feature buttons, a docking and recharging station, 
and more. Trés cool. For the price and simplicity, every home theater owner 
should check out these Harmony remotes.
 
If you want a really big touch screen, Harmony 1000 ($500) offers a big 3.5-inch 
touch screen and moves almost all the controls from dedicated keys to the 
touch interface. Again, this is a lot less money than the high-end systems we 
discuss in Chapter 23.

Par  t IV
Put  ting It All 
Together

In this part . . .
S
o you know what stuff you need to buy to set up a 
home theater, and you may have even bought it. Well, 
if you’re like us, buying stuff is a reflexive act. We could 
do it in our sleep. The hard part is figuring out how to 
hook it all up. Fear not — Part IV to the rescue.
First, we talk about the cables and connectors you can 
use to connect the components of your home theater. 
This is an important section to read because in many 
cases you have a choice of cable types, and some cables 
are simply much better than others in terms of creating a 
home theater that looks and sounds like it should.
Next, we talk you through the “insert tab A into slot A” 
aspect of connecting a home theater. Now, remember that 
this advice is generic. Home theater equipment vendors are 
always coming up with their own little “modifications,” 
making it hard for us to give concrete advice that applies in 
every situation. But we get you 99 percent of the way there.
We also talk about how to do some nontraditional things 
with your home theater. First, we discuss how to connect 
your home theater components into a whole-home net-
work that lets you view, listen to, and control expensive 
home theater gear anywhere in your home. We also give 
you some details about how to hook up the home theater 
PCs we talk about in Part II, so that you can bring the 
power of the PC (and the Internet) to your home theater!

Chapter 16
Home Theater Cable Basics
In This Chapter
 Making short-run connections
 Connecting speakers
 Choosing a digital connection
 Connecting the rest of the house
 Looking at cabling odds and ends
O
ne of the most puzzling, infuriating, blood-pressure-raising tasks in 
assembling a home theater is finding the right kind, size, shape, and 
length of cables. Someday in the not-so-distant future, if the stars align just 
right, there may be a single type of digital cable that can connect every-
thing — this is the holy grail of the consumer electronics industry. All 
that’s needed is some widespread agreement among all parties to make this 
happen.
 
There’s hope here — a cable system called HDMI, capable of carrying both 
audio and video, is becoming popular. (Those in the know know that HDMI 
stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface.) It won’t solve the problem for 
your older gear, but it’s becoming almost standard on new equipment, even 
on networked devices that bring Internet content to your home theater. We 
discuss HDMI in the section titled “Employing digital video connections.”
We may soon see an even better solution to the cabling problem: no cabling 
at all. The day is coming when inexpensive yet high-performance wireless 
systems will let you connect your components together without worrying 
about which plug goes where — or which throw rug to buy to hide that 
tangle of speaker wire.
We can dream of the day when complex cabling is no longer necessary, but 
although it’s getting closer, it hasn’t arrived yet. In this chapter, we discuss 
the different kinds of cables required to hook up the common components 
in a home theater as well as those needed to share your theater with the rest 
of the house. When there’s more than one way to hook one component to 
another, we tell you which cable is best.

242
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Working with Short Run Cables
Most of the connections you make in a home theater are short runs — that is, 
connections between components that are sitting just a few feet from each 
other (or are at least in the same room). The cables you use for these con-
nections are typically called interconnects. Later in this chapter, we talk about 
the long-run cables that make up the infrastructure of a whole-home audio 
and video network.
Choosing quality cables
We should take a moment here to talk about cable quality — right up front, 
in the beginning of the chapter. You can get audio cable (or most any kind of 
cable) for free in the box when you buy new equipment. Or you can pay liter-
ally $1000 a foot for the double-secret-mojo, cold-fusion-reactor-type cables. 
In case you think we’re kidding, we’re not. (Well, we are about the cold-fusion 
part.) Some people pay thousands of dollars for each cable in their system. 
Our take on the matter is this: Don’t use the free el cheapo cables that came 
in the box — because you do get what you pay for — but don’t pay $1000+ 
per cable either unless you are both rich and absolutely convinced that 
you can hear an improvement in your sound or see an improvement in your 
video. There’s a happy medium. Bottom line: Yes, there is a difference in 
cables, but no, you don’t have to pay a ton for good cables.
 
Look for cables that use oxygen-free copper (OFC) conductors and have gold-
plated surfaces on the jacks. Oxygen-free copper is a purer form of copper, 
and the gold-plated surfaces resist corrosion. Use the shortest run of cable 
possible because the longer that audio signal travels over the cable, the more 
likely the signal will be audibly degraded by interference or attenuation (the 
weakening of the signal as it travels over any cable).
Dozens of companies make high-quality cables at a wide range of prices. 
Right off the bat, we can name Blue Jeans Cable (www.bluejeanscable.
com), Kimber Kable (www.kimber.com), and AudioQuest (www.audio
quest.com). By the way, there are so many good cables out on the market, 
please don’t feel like our short list is anywhere near exhaustive. We could 
have filled a page with company names.
Joining the RCA mania
The most common type of connector in any home theater is the standard 
analog audio interconnect. Traditionally, these cables came in pairs for two-
channel (stereo) audio connections, but in the realm of the home theater, 
with its multiple surround-sound channels, cables don’t always work in neat 

243
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
pairs. You may find yourself using these cables individually (like the cable 
that connects a subwoofer to the receiver or controller), in big bunches (like 
the six cables that connect an SACD [Super Audio CD] or DVD-Audio player 
to the receiver, or in even bigger bunches (the eight cables for connecting a 
Blu-ray disc player’s audio output).
Audio interconnects use a standardized jack known as an RCA jack, which is 
nice because any audio interconnect with RCA jacks will plug in to any cor-
responding RCA plug on a piece of A/V equipment. Figure 16-1 shows an RCA 
plug on a stereo (dual) pair of audio interconnects.

uitous RCA

If you go shopping for audio interconnects, you’ll find a huge array of differ-
ent cable constructions. The typical audio interconnect is a coaxial cable, 
which means that it has two electrical conductors surrounded by a shielded 
jacket within the cable. This jacket is called shielded because it is designed 
to keep stray electromagnetic energy from getting into the conductors and 
causing interference with the audio signal. But you’ll find a lot of variation 
out there, and some cables are unshielded but twisted. (Twisting has a simi-
lar effect to shielding — due to the black art of physics, twisted cables can 
cancel out interferences.)
Connecting your speakers
Another cable that you’ll find in every home theater (except for those that 
use active loudspeaker systems, which we discuss in Chapter 12) is the 
speaker cable. Speaker cables connect the outputs of the power amplifier or 
the amplifier section of the receiver to the speaker. These cables carry the 
high-powered electrical currents required to move the internal components 
of the speaker (the magnets that move the drivers, as described in Chapter 
12). You need one pair of speaker cables for each speaker in your system 
(except for the subwoofer if it’s an active system — which most are — and 
which uses an analog audio interconnect cable instead).

244
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Some expensive speaker systems can use two pairs of speaker wires per 
speaker. These systems are either biwired or biamped:
 
 Biwired: Two sets of speaker wire connect to the same output on 
the receiver or power amplifier, and you plug them into two sets of 
terminals on the speaker itself.
 
 Biamped: The speaker uses two separate amplifiers — one for the 
low-frequency drivers and one for the high-frequency drivers.
 
Biwiring is one of those audiophile tricks that most people don’t really hear. If 
it works for you, and you have speakers with such a setup, by all means use it. 
But for us, it’s just not worth the expense of the extra set of speaker cables.
Because they typically go for longer distances (especially in the case of 
surround speakers) and carry more electrical current than interconnects, 
speaker cables are considerably beefier and thicker than interconnects. 
The thickness of speaker cables (or the conductors within, to be precise) 
is referred to as gauge (using the standard AWG, or American Wire Gauge, 
system). The lower the gauge, the thicker the conductors.
Thicker conductors have less electrical resistance to the current flowing 
through them. Too much resistance is a bad thing (it can alter the audio 
signal), and the longer the cable, the greater the resistance the signal faces 
while traveling over the cable. We recommend cables of no higher than 
16-gauge thickness, and prefer 14-gauge cables. For longer runs of 40 feet or 
more, such as runs to surround-sound speakers in a large room, we recom-
mend moving down (in gauge number, up in size) to 12-gauge cables if they 
fit your budget.
 
If you want to hide your speaker cables in the wall or are running speaker 
cables through the wall for a multizone audio system, you need to get cables 
that are specially designed for this purpose and that meet electrical code 
requirements. You should choose cables that have been certified for this pur-
pose by Underwriters Laboratories (UL-certified) and that meet the CL3 speci-
fication (which relates to the insulation on the wires and helps prevent fires).
Unlike audio interconnects, which share the common RCA connector, you have 
a ton of connector choices when it comes to speaker cables (these connectors 
are sometimes called terminations). The most bare-bones approach is to just 
use the bare wire itself (stripped of any insulation), but many folks prefer some 
sort of a terminating device on the ends of the cable, mainly for aesthetics, 
but you may also find that the connectors on your speakers or receiver work 
better with a wire that’s been terminated with one of the connectors we dis-
cuss shortly. (Often choosing a cable connector is just a matter of fit, especially 
if you’re using a set of big, fat, 12-gauge speaker wires.)

245
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
You’ll see three main types of connectors (besides the bare wire) on the 
market:
 
 Pin connectors: These look like they sound — a straight or angled pin 
at the end of the wire (though it’s not sharp, so you won’t put your eye 
out). These work best with the spring-loaded clip type of speaker con-
nectors, which you find on less expensive receivers and speakers. Pin 
connectors also work with the preferred five-way binding posts found on 
better models. (We talk about five-way binding posts in Chapter 12.)
 
 Spade lugs: These U-shaped connectors fit behind the screws on a five-
way binding post. You slide the open part of the U over the post and 
then screw down the plastic nut. Spade lugs can provide the tightest, 
most reliable connection because of that screwing down. Some spade 
lugs go beyond the U shape and are shaped like three-quarters of a 
circle, to hook around your binding post. These “hooked” connectors 
tend to be even more secure.
 
 Banana plugs: If you squint really hard, these plugs may actually look 
like bananas, but they really look more like pin connectors that are fat in 
the middle. By bowing out in the middle, they provide a tight fit into the 
binding post. Banana plugs come in single and dual configurations. The 
dual variety is just two banana plugs (one for each wire in the pair of 
speaker wires) stuck together in the same housing.
Figure 16-2 shows the pin, spade lug, and banana plug, and Figure 16-3 shows 
a five-way binding post.

Although the spade lug provides the ultimate in speaker wire connections, we 
think the banana plug provides a connection that’s very close in quality. The 
banana plug is also much easier to use because the banana just slides into 
the binding post (nothing to tighten or adjust). Banana plugs are also handy 
because the back of a multichannel surround-sound receiver is a crowded 
place with the speaker terminals often quite close together. Banana plugs 
give you the ability to connect the wires by just sticking them straight into a 
hole on the binding post (perpendicular to the back of the receiver). We can 
tell you from experience how much easier this is than trying to jam fat wires 
through seven pairs of speaker terminals located about a half-inch apart.
 
Your choice of speaker cable connectors is largely driven by the receiver 
and speaker choices you make. While ideally manufacturers would create 
gear that could accept any of these connectors, the real world of designing 
and manufacturing A/V gear often makes that difficult. When you look at the 
sheer number of speaker connections that sprout on the back of a 7.1-channel 
receiver (at least fourteen individual connectors just for the speakers — not to 
mention all the audio and video interconnects), there’s often just not enough 
room to accept many of the larger connectors (such as spade lugs). When 
you’re purchasing speaker cables, try to be sure that the connectors will fit — 
and make sure you can return the cables if they simply won’t fit on your gear.
Using digital audio interconnects
With the advent of computer-chip-laden receivers and DVD players, home 
theater has moved home A/V gear into the digital age. True, CD players 
have been digital for years, but for the majority of people, all the digital stuff 
happened inside the CD. The connections between the CD player and the 
receiver were all analog. Surround sound (specifically digital surround-sound 
systems, such as Dolby Digital and DTS) has made the digital interconnect 
commonplace.

247
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
As we mention throughout the book, digital audio interconnects (to connect 
DVD players, HDTV tuners, video game consoles, and more to the A/V receiver 
or controller) are divided into two main types: coaxial and optical (or Toslink).
 
The HDMI connection (discussed later in this chapter, in the section called 
“Employing digital video connections”) is primarily used as a method for 
making digital video connections, but HDMI can also carry up to eight chan-
nels of digital audio. As A/V receivers begin to include HDMI connections (and 
a growing number are), you’ll be able to use a single cable to connect a source 
device such as a Blu-ray disc or DVD player or set-top box to your receiver, 
and also a single cable to connect the receiver to your display. Home theater 
cable nirvana is within sight (at least for new equipment that includes HDMI)!
Coaxial digital interconnects
The coaxial interconnect looks an awful lot like a single (mono) audio inter-
connect. It has standard RCA jacks on both ends and a coaxial cable between 
them. Put the analog audio and coaxial interconnects side-by-side on a table 
(unlabeled of course), and you really can’t tell them apart. But the conduc-
tors inside coaxial cables are of a different construction that’s designed to 
handle the higher frequencies of digital signals. You shouldn’t use standard 
audio interconnects in place of a coaxial digital cable. It’s tough to explain 
the difference in sound you may experience if you use the wrong kind of 
cable here, but if your digital audio just doesn’t sound right, check to see 
whether you have the correct digital interconnect hooked up.
 
Coaxial digital interconnects are not the only example of cables that use RCA 
plugs and look like audio interconnects but are not. Both the composite and 
the component video cables we discuss shortly also appear to be identical to 
audio interconnects, but in fact use different internal conductors and designs.
Also keep in mind that the term coax is typically used to describe the cables 
for connecting antennas, cable TV feeds, and satellite dishes to your home 
theater. That type of coax (using the F connector) is a completely different 
kettle of fish from a coaxial digital audio cable.
Optical digital interconnects
The Toslink optical connector uses fiber optics instead of copper cabling and 
carries the digital signal as pulses of light instead of as an electrical signal. 
The connector on a Toslink interconnect, viewed head-on, looks like a nice 
little house in suburbia — except most houses don’t have a laser flashing out 
of the side of them. (Well at least ours don’t — we won’t presume to speak 
for you.) Figure 16-4 shows the Toslink cable connector.
 
The female Toslink connector (on your receiver or DVD player or wherever 
you’re plugging a Toslink into) is usually covered by a little removable dust 
cap. If you don’t take off this cap, you’re going to curse like a sailor trying to 
plug in that cable.

248

Some folks argue strongly either for Toslink or for coaxial digital audio con-
nectors — we don’t have any qualms recommending them both. Our basic 
advice is to use whichever is available to you — if they’re both available, 
they’re both equally good, assuming you don’t use cables that fell off the 
back of a speeding van in your neighborhood.
Using analog video connections
The majority of video connections in a home theater are still made using 
analog connections (though an increasing number of devices can use the 
newer digital video interconnects we discuss in the following section). You’ll 
find three types of short-run analog video connections in a home theater.
 
To truly understand the differences between the types of connections, you 
need to first understand what kinds of signals these cables carry. There are 
two components to a video signal: the luminance and the chrominance. The 
luminance provides the video display with the brightness information that 
determines which parts of the screen are darker or lighter. The chrominance 
adds information about what color each segment of the screen should be.
A definite hierarchy exists among video connections. One is visibly worse (in 
terms of picture quality) than the other two, and of the two superior meth-
ods, one is better (though not as significantly) than the other. In ascending 
order (worst to best), these connection types are as follows:
 
 Composite video: Both luminance and chrominance are combined into 
a single signal. The comb filter inside the display (discussed in Chapter 
13) separates these two components and sends them to the appropriate 
internal circuitry.
 
 S-video: In S-video, luminance and chrominance are separated onto two 
separate signal paths, so the signal can bypass the comb filter in the TV. 
This usually results in a much clearer picture, with more defined colors 
and images.

249
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
 
 Component video: Component video separates the signal even further, 
providing one path for luminance information and two separate paths 
for chrominance information. Component video connections can be fur-
ther enhanced in a wideband component video connection, which allows 
the higher frequencies needed for HDTV to travel from the source (such 
as an HDTV tuner) to the HDTV monitor.
So the big difference between composite (the lower-quality video signal), 
S-video, and component video connections is the fact that the better connec-
tions carry luminance and chrominance information separately. Why is this 
a big deal? After all, the display does have a comb filter to take care of that 
problem. Well, here’s a dirty little secret: Comb filters do an imperfect job of 
separating these two signals and can leave visible artifacts in your picture. 
You want the sharpest, most colorful picture you can get, don’t you?
In some cases, you might not choose the highest-quality connection available 
to you. We talk about such cases in Chapter 17, when we discuss hooking up 
your home theater.
Both component and composite cables use standard RCA connectors and 
bear a striking resemblance to the analog audio interconnect (and the digital 
coaxial interconnect, for that matter). Composite video cables are loners 
(you need just one), and component video cables travel in small packs of 
three, often labeled Y, Pr, and Pb.
 
Composite video cables are usually color-coded yellow (that is to say, the con-
nector usually has a yellow ring around it, or the rubber boot around the con-
nector is yellow). Component video cables are also typically color-coded with 
red, green, and blue connectors.
S-video is an unmistakable beast, with its own special connector (the S-video 
connector of course). This connector has four small pins that correspond 
to four small holes on the S-video plug on your gear. Figure 16-5 shows an 
S-video connector.
 
Figure 16-5:

nance and

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
S-video connectors can be a real pain in the butt to line up and connect. One 
set of pins is slightly more widely spaced than the other (the bottom ones 
are farther apart). If you’re really killing yourself, check to see that you aren’t 
pushing this cable in upside down. A little plastic doohickey keeps you from 
really messing things up, but bent pins are far from unknown to first-time 
S-video users. Most of the time, they’re not so bent that you can’t use your fin-
gertip to get them straightened back out.
Employing digital video connections
The consumer electronics industry (in association with content providers) 
has been working overtime to develop some digital video interconnection 
systems that satisfy the following requirements:
 
 Preserve the digital signal: The video connection systems we discuss 
in the previous section are all analog systems. They carry analog video 
signals, not digital ones. Nothing is inherently wrong with analog connec-
tions, but they are more susceptible to interferences and other losses of 
signal quality when compared to digital connections. And in the case of 
digital signals (such as HDTV and other ATSC digital television broad-
casts), there’s no reason to convert to analog until the very last minute 
(inside the display itself). As Dick Vitale might say, “Keep it digital, baby!”
 
 Minimize cables: Some of these analog connections (particularly com-
ponent video) also require multiple cables per connection. So if you 
want to connect the component video output of your HDTV tuner to 
your receiver and then to your display, you need six cables (three for 
each link). Add a DVD player using component video into the mix, and 
you have six more cables. Pretty soon, you have spaghetti. And this 
doesn’t even include the cables required for audio!
 
 Provide copy protection: These analog connections don’t have inher-
ent copy protection systems. If there’s one thing that content providers 
(movie and television studios) want to prevent, it’s people copying their 
content. They don’t even really want to let you make copies for personal 
use, such as copying CSI when you’re out of town on business so that 
you can watch it after you come home.
We discuss the most common digital video connection options in the 
following sections.
FireWire
One of the first systems for digital video crossed over from the computer 
industry. FireWire, which is also called IEEE 1394 or i.LINK, depending on 

251
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
who’s talking, was originally developed by Apple Computer for connecting 
peripheral devices to Macintosh computers. Companies such as Sony picked 
up on the technology and began incorporating FireWire into its camcorders 
and PCs, and FireWire grew from there. (The FireWire in camcorders is often 
called DV.)
For several years, some HDTV devices (such as JVC’s D-VHS) used FireWire 
connections, but as we write, FireWire appears to have all but gone away as a 
means of connecting HDTV devices.
So why do we mention it? Well, for starters, you can still find a few HDTV sys-
tems that use FireWire. Additionally, FireWire is beginning to become more 
common in the audio side of the home theater. The DVD Forum (a coalition 
of companies that helps develop the DVD standard) has recently approved 
FireWire as a connection method for the audio output of DVD-Audio players. 
When these players (and compatible receivers or controllers) hit the market, 
you’ll be able to replace those six analog audio interconnects with a single 
cable. That will be nice!
 
Although HDMI, FireWire’s biggest competitors in the digital video connec-
tion world, appear to have won the war of digital video interconnects, battles 
are still being fought, and FireWire may still have a little life left in it. A group 
called HANA (High-definition Audio-Video Networking Alliance, www.hana
alliance.org) was formed to create yet another set of standards for con-
necting your A/V gear, and FireWire is a big part of that system. So we can’t 
count FireWire out completely yet.
Digital Visual Interface
One reason that FireWire never took off in the world of home theater was the 
success of a competitor called DVI (Digital Visual Interface). DVI is another 
technology adopted from the computer world, where it was developed as a 
means of connecting computers to digital LCD screens and projectors. Along 
the way, DVI picked up a strong copy protection system called HDCP (dis-
cussed in Chapter 13) and became a favorite of the HDTV industry.
HDCP makes DVI a relatively dumb connection — all it does is send video 
in one direction (for example, from the tuner to the display), and HDCP can 
limit your ability to make a digital copy of what you’re watching. Figure 16-6 
shows a DVI connector.
 
Not all devices with a DVI connector incorporate HDCP. For example, LCD 
computer monitors may use DVI without HDCP. If you connect an HDCP-
enabled HDTV tuner to a non-HDCP display using a DVI cable, you can’t get a 
full HDTV signal. Instead, the signal is converted to a lower resolution.

252
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
Figure 16-6: 
A DVI con-
nector for

DVI provides a great video connection but it doesn’t carry audio like its suc-
cessor, HDMI does. For the most part, in new equipment such as TVs and 
Blu-ray disc and DVD players, DVI has been phased out in favor of HDMI. If 
you have a piece of gear in your home theater that uses DVI but needs to be 
connected to a newer piece of HDMI-only gear, you can buy a cheap (usually 
under $20) adapter to connect the two. There will be no audio over that DVI-
to-HDMI connection, but the video will work just fine.
The state of the art in digital video connections: HDMI
The latest and greatest in digital video (and audio) connections is the HDMI 
cable. HDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface, and you can find 
out more about the technology at the HDMI Web site at www.hdmi.org.
HDMI is being included in a variety of devices these days, including HDTVs, 
DVD players (both the current generation of DVD players and the high-
definition Blu-ray disc player), cable and satellite set-top boxes, Media Center 
Edition PCs, gaming consoles such as the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft 
Xbox 360, and even in digital media adapter devices such as the Apple TV or 
Roku’s Netflix player (discussed in Chapter 10).
Why you will love HDMI!
What’s so great about HDMI? Well, a few things:
 
 It’s all-digital. Like DVI and FireWire, HDMI provides an all-digital path 
for your standard and high-definition video signals.
 
 It’s high-bandwidth. HDMI can support data signals as fast as 4.9GB per 
second — with the newest High Speed variant supporting 10.2GB per 
second. That means it can handle HDTV with plenty of room to spare. 
(In fact, many HDTV signals uses less than half this bandwidth, so the 
HDTV signals don’t have to be compressed.) FireWire, by comparison, 
tops out at 400MB per second (there is an 800MB per second variant, 
but it’s not common) — less than half the bandwidth.

253
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
 
 It can support all variants of HDTV. 720p, 1080i, even 1080p can run 
over an HDMI cable.
 
 It can carry up to eight channels of digital audio. So a single HDMI 
cable can carry your HDTV and your 7.1-channel surround sound. 
Nothing like reducing the tangle of cables behind your system, huh?
As you shop for HDMI cables, you might consider consulting a cardiolo-
gist simply because the big-name HDMI cables in your average electronics 
store are incredibly expensive and may cause your heart to palpitate. Don’t 
fear — HDMI cables don’t have to be super-expensive. In fact, certified HDMI 
cables can be relatively cheap, and there are many good online sources for 
them. For example, Pat recently installed some HDMI cables in his wall that 
were about one-fifth the price of those at his local retail store, and they work 
great! We highly recommend that you spend a few moments perusing some 
of the other sources of information we discuss in Chapter 23 (such as the 
AVS Forum) and see what the home theater enthusiasts are using and where 
they’re getting it online. You’ll probably get a great bargain.
As long as your HDMI cable runs are less than 10 meters, you can buy one of 
these inexpensive cables and expect excellent results. When you get past ten 
meters (that’s more than thirty feet — a long way!), we recommend that you 
consult a specialist because you might need some special active components 
to boost the signal level. But we’re confident that most folks won’t need to go 
more than thirty feet!
 
We think HDMI is the way to go. If you’re shopping for a new TV, a new 
receiver, or a new DVD player, or choosing an HDTV set-top box or satellite 
receiver, go with HDMI if you can. HDMI can provide the highest-quality video 
signal and throws your multichannel surround-sound audio in on the same 
cable. You really can’t go wrong here!
HDMI is fully backward compatible with DVI. What that means is that you can 
interconnect HDMI and DVI devices. So you can connect, for example, a DVI 
connector on your HDTV cable set-top box to an HDMI input on your new 
plasma TV (or vice versa). Keep in mind that such connections will carry only 
video signals — DVI doesn’t support audio. If you’re buying all new gear, it’s 
best to choose HDMI all around, but if you’re upgrading, the good news is that 
HDMI won’t strand your investment in DVI-equipped gear. All you need is an 
inexpensive adapter (about $20) or HDMI-to-DVI cables, which have an HDMI 
connector on one end and a DVI connector on the other. We love it when some-
thing new doesn’t make us have to throw away our old gear — don’t you?
Understanding the latest developments in HDMI
If you read about Blu-ray disc players in Chapter 6 (go ahead, read it, Blu-
ray disc players are really cool), you might recall the confusion that Blu-ray 
profiles have caused a lot of otherwise smart people. Well HDMI has been 
facing a similar problem over the past couple of years as the technology has 
matured and new capabilities have been added to HDMI.

254
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
In fact, the problem that HDMI buyers have been facing is exactly the same 
one that Blu-ray buyer’s have faced: confusion and uncertainty based on 
some technical terms that really should never have been part of the public 
discussion of the technology. In Blu-ray’s case, profiles made people wonder 
“Well, is this thing going to be obsolete in six months?” In HDMI’s case it was 
versions of the technical standard for HDMI as the folks developing HDMI 
chips moved from version 1 to version 1.1 to version 1.2 and now to version 
1.3. How the heck are we supposed to keep up with all of that?
Well the short answer is, we’re not, and the smart folks at HDMI licensing 
(who oversee the development of HDMI) are working to give us all some new 
commonsense plain English terms that describe the different types of HDMI. 
By the time you read this chapter, HDMI cables will be classified into two 
groups:
 
 HDMI: These cables have been tested to support up to 1080i HDTV sig-
nals. They may very well support 1080p (and in almost all cases will do 
so at shorter distances — 2 or 3 meters or less), but they’ve not been 
tested and certified to do so.
 
 HDMI High Speed: These cables have been tested up to the very highest 
speeds available in HDMI (10.2GB per second), and will support 1080p as 
well as other special video enhancements such as deep color and faster 
refresh rates (120 Hz, for example) as they become available in high-
definition source devices and TVs. (We talk about deep color and higher 
refresh rates in Chapter 13.)
Having said all that, we (and the HDMI licensing folks) know that the horse is 
out of the barn, and that you’re going to hear about HDMI 1.whatever when 
you’re shopping for equipment. Here’s a quick rundown on the different ver-
sions of HDMI.
 
These descriptions discuss all the features that a particular HDMI implemen-
tation may include. Manufacturers are not required to offer all the features 
incorporated in a particular version of HDMI. So a manufacturer could offer 
a system (such as a DVD player) with an HDMI 1.3 chip (and advertise it as 
HDMI 1.3 equipped) and not provide every feature we’re about to mention. It 
is always important to look beyond the HDMI number and review the actual 
features included with the equipment. For example, if it’s important to you 
that your HDMI-equipped Blu-ray disc player and receiver can carry Dolby 
TrueHD bitstreams over the HDMI cable, it’s not enough to just see the HDMI 
1.3 check box filled in on the spec sheet — you need to make sure that this 
specific feature is included on both devices.
 
 HDMI 1: This is the first version of HDMI, supporting up to eight chan-
nels of audio and 1080p video.
 
 HDMI 1.1: This version added support for the audio from DVD-Audio 
players over the HDMI connection.

255
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
 
 HDMI 1.2: This version includes support for SACD audio players, and 
additionally incorporates a control system called HDMI CEC (discussed 
in the sidebar titled “HMDI CEC gives you control”).
 
 HDMI 1.3: This is the latest version of HDMI and includes some of the 
biggest changes yet in the standard. The really big news here is the 
increased bandwidth it allows (the 10.2GB per second we mentioned 
earlier in the section), which allows HDMI 1.3 to support 1080p video 
plus the bitstreams of the highest resolution surround-sound codecs 
such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, plus additional fea-
tures such as deeper color depths. In fact, so much bandwidth is avail-
able on an HDMI 1.3 connection that a manufacturer could make a 3D TV 
that was fed two 1080p connections at the same time. That’s a lot 
of bandwidth.
 
All HDMI systems are backward compatible so any HDMI-equipped system can 
be connected to any other HDMI-equipped system and work just fine. Some 
features (such as 1080p or Dolby TrueHD bitstreams) may not be enabled, but 
you’ll be able to make the connection and get a fine high-definition picture 
and surround-sound audio without worries. Additionally, all versions of HDMI 
use the same cable connectors, so you won’t need to swap out cables in most 
cases.
HMDI CEC gives you control
When the 1.2 version of HDMI came out a few 
years ago, it included a new HDMI feature that 
manufacturers are starting to incorporate in 
their home theater gear today: HDMI CEC (CEC 
stands for Consumer Electronics Control). HDMI 
CEC is a two-way control system that allows 
different components in your home theater to 
“talk” to each other to send control signals and 
to understand the current state of each compo-
nent. In an HDMI CEC–equipped home theater, 
one button press on the remote can turn on a 
number of components — so if you wanted to 
watch a movie on a Blu-ray disc, one button 
press would turn on the TV, the Blu-ray disc 
player, and the home theater receiver.
In essence, HDMI CEC is a built-in version of 
the macros we discuss in Chapter 15 when we 
talk about remote controls. But instead of the 
remote sending out separate IR (infrared) com-
mands to each component, HDMI CEC uses the 
HDMI connections between components to 
send out commands.
We’re still in the early days of HDMI CEC, with 
only a small number of components having the 
feature. The best implementations of CEC, as 
we write, are within a specific vendor’s prod-
uct line (such as Sony’s BRAVIA theater sync 
system). HDMI CEC does work across and 
amongst vendors (so your Panasonic TV could 
“talk” with your Sony Blu-ray disc player), but 
you’ll find that a vendor’s own implementation 
will have more features and more commands.
We’re excited about HDMI CEC and expect to 
see it become a standard part of new home the-
ater gear as time passes.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Working with Long-Run Cables
When you start thinking about connecting your home theater to the rest 
of your home (perhaps to share a video source device with TVs in other 
rooms), you’ll run into a new set of cables. These long-run cables are 
designed to minimize signal loss and get your audio and video to any spot in 
the house. Although you can distribute audio and video around the home in 
many ways, the three most common ways are the following:
 
 RG6 coaxial cabling for video: This cable (which we describe later in 
this chapter) carries video signals (and the associated audio tracks) 
from antennas, satellite dishes, and cable TV feeds from the street. With 
devices called modulators, you can actually create in-house TV channels 
and use this cable to share your own video sources with other TVs in 
the house.
 
 Speaker cabling for whole-home audio: We discuss speaker wires 
(appropriately rated for in-wall use) in the “Connecting your speakers” 
section, earlier in this chapter. You can use this same speaker wire to 
connect a multizone receiver (or a separate whole-home audio system) 
to speakers throughout the house.
 
 Category 5e (CAT-5e) or Category 6 (CAT-6) network cabling: This is 
the cable used for computer networks — the stuff you put in your walls 
if you are creating a whole-home network. With the appropriate gear on 
the ends of these cables (we discuss this in Chapter 18), you can use 
this cable to carry audio and video signals.
Going with RG6
Coaxial cable (usually just called coax) is a metallic cable most often used 
for transmitting radio frequency (RF) signals, such as broadband television 
video and radio signals. Coaxial cable contains two conductors, or axes, to 
carry data. A layer of dielectric insulating material surrounds a single center 
conductor. The other conductor is a metal shield, usually made of a braided 
metallic wiring, that goes around the dielectric (insulating) layer. The outer-
most layer of coax cable is an insulating jacket. The connectors on an RG6 
cable are known as F connectors.
 
You may encounter coaxial cables labeled RG6QS or RG6 Quad Shield, which 
means that the cable has additional shielding beneath the cable jacket — four 
layers, as the quad implies. These layers provide additional protection against 
interference from external sources. Because of this extra shielding, we recom-
mend you use Quad Shield coax. It doesn’t cost a lot more, and it’s worth the 
investment.

257
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
CAT-5e/CAT-6 cabling systems
If you’ve ever spent any time building, designing, or just using a computer 
network, you’ve encountered CAT-5e or CAT-6 cabling — often generically 
called Ethernet cables. (These are two similar types of data cables — CAT-5e 
is the most common, so we refer to it here, but both will work just fine.) 
CAT-5e is a type of UTP (unshielded twisted pair) copper cabling and can be 
used for phones, computer networks, home automation networks, and audio/
video distribution systems. CAT-5e cables typically consist of four pairs of 
wire (eight total conductors) wrapped in a single jacket. The ends of CAT-5e 
cables are terminated in connectors known as RJ-45 jacks, which look exactly 
like the common RJ-11 phone jack, only wider.
CAT-5e cabling can be used to connect your home theater to your computer 
LAN (local area network) and through this LAN to the Internet. For example, 
CAT-5e connectors are commonly found on MP3 servers, PVRs, and increas-
ingly on audio source devices that are designed to play back Internet radio 
stations or MP3 files located on a computer in your house. CAT-5e cabling may 
be used also to connect the A/V source components in your home theater to 
other rooms in the house. (We discuss systems that do this in Chapter 19.)
There is actually a range of category-rated UTP cables (for example, CAT-3 
cabling is often used for telephone wiring). CAT-6 is the current top-of-
the-line UTP cabling, suitable for very fast computer networks, but CAT-5e 
cable is the most common for home use and is more than adequate for your 
home’s wiring.
 
Each piece of a CAT-5e system (the cables themselves, the RJ-45 jacks, and so 
on) is subject to the CAT-5e rating system. If you use CAT-5e, make sure all the 
pieces and parts are rated CAT-5e. The “weakest link in the chain” rule applies 
here. Any piece that’s rated below CAT-5e brings the whole system down to 
that lower rating. Many A/V-over-UTP systems require CAT-5e and don’t work 
well on identical-looking but lower-rated cables. All CAT-5e cables and connec-
tors will be clearly marked with a label of some sort, so just read the fine print 
(on the cable itself) to be sure.
Identifying Other Cable Odds and Ends
We end this chapter with a hodgepodge listing of other cables and connec-
tors that may show up in your home theater. These connection systems are 
less common than the ones discussed in preceding sections, but none of 
them is a complete stranger to the world of home theater. This is particularly 
true if you are hooking your home theater into a whole-home network or con-
necting PCs and other computer-like devices (such as PVRs and MP3 servers) 
into your home theater.

258
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Wireless connections
Wireless networking technologies have made a huge splash in the computer 
networking world — everyone, it seems, has gone crazy for a system called 
802.11 or Wi-Fi (a type of wireless computer LAN). (Read our books Smart 
Homes For Dummies and Wireless Home Networking For Dummies, both pub-
lished by Wiley Publishing, Inc., for a ton of information about this technol-
ogy — and you Mac folks might want to check out Airport and Mac Wireless 
Networking For Dummies, by Michael Cohen, as well.)
As more people begin to use PCs and the Internet in their home theaters, this 
technology is increasingly moving from the computer world to the consumer 
electronics world. Many manufacturers, such as NETGEAR (www.netgear.
com) and D-Link (www.dlink.com), are creating devices called Wi-Fi Ethernet 
bridges specifically for home entertainment/home theater gear. These bridges 
make it easy to connect Internet-capable home theater gear to your home’s 
Wi-Fi network with the help of an Ethernet port. (Ethernet is the common 
computer network that uses CAT-5e cabling and RJ-45 jacks.) For about $100, 
you can buy one of these bridges and use a short length of CAT-5e cabling to 
connect it to your PVR (personal video recorder), MP3 server, home theater 
PC, or even your gaming console (such as Xbox or PlayStation 3). The bridge 
then connects wirelessly (using radio waves) to your DSL or cable modem 
through a device called an access point.
In Chapter 10, we discuss a number of Wi-Fi–enabled systems that let you get 
content into your home theater.
RS-232
If you’ve ever connected a modem to an older PC, you’ve probably used 
an RS-232 connector and not even known it. RS-232 is a standard computer 
communications system that’s more commonly known as a serial connec-
tion. Until the advent of the USB system (discussed in the following section), 
RS-232 was the standard connection for modems, handheld computer cra-
dles, and many other PC peripheral devices.
In the home theater world, RS-232 is not used for carrying audio and video. 
It is, however, often used for connecting A/V components to automation and 
control systems (such as the Crestron systems we discuss in Chapter 15). 
You can also find RS-232 ports on the back of many advanced A/V receivers, 
where they can be used to connect the receiver to a PC for upgrading the 
software system within the receiver.

259
 Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics 
USB
USB (or Universal Serial Bus) has pretty much replaced RS-232 in the PC 
world. These days, most printers, external modems, handheld comput-
ers, portable MP3 players, and other PC peripheral devices connect to PCs 
via USB. In the home theater world, USB can be found on the back of many 
computer-like source devices (such as MP3 servers and PVRs). USB has not 
yet replaced RS-232 for connections to automation and control systems, but 
probably will eventually.
The most common use for USB in a home theater is with a Wi-Fi system. You 
can outfit source devices that can connect to the Internet with a USB Wi-Fi 
network adapter. This adapter enables you to connect back to the access point 
and out to the Internet. USB is used also for remote control connections for 
PCs. The remote control receiver for the PC connects to the PC via a USB cable.
 
Multiple types of USB devices are out there. (With more than 1 billion USB-
enabled devices in use around the world, that’s probably no surprise.) The 
latest and greatest variant of USB is USB 2.0 High-speed, which supports data 
transfers at speeds of up to 480 Mbits per second. The older and slower USB 
1.1 standard doesn’t cut it for home theater use, because it can barely handle 
audio signals and just plain can’t do high-quality video.
You can also find a few A/V receivers (such as JVC’s RX-D201S — www.jvc.
com) that have a USB connection that lets you connect to a nearby PC to feed 
digital audio signals (such as MP3 files) from the PC to the receiver without 
using one of the media adapter devices we discuss in Chapter 10.
IR connections
In Chapter 18, we talk about ways that you can connect your home theater 
to speakers and displays in other parts of your home by using a whole-home 
entertainment network. As we discuss earlier in this chapter, you use RG6 
coaxial cable, speaker wire, CAT-5e cabling, or any combination of the three 
to carry your audio and video around the house. There’s one other piece to 
this whole-home puzzle, however. You need some sort of system for control-
ling remote devices when you are watching them (or listening to them) in 
a different part of the house. If the phone rings, you want to be able to turn 
down the music or pause the movie.
Most A/V systems use IR (infrared) systems for their remote controls. IR is 
a great system, but because it uses a beam of light to carry control signals, 
it can’t penetrate walls (unless you have a glass house, we suppose). So you 
need some sort of wired system that can carry IR signals from remote loca-
tions back to your home theater. (You can also find wireless alternatives 
from companies such as X10 — www.x10.com.) You can set up an infrared 
system in four ways:

260
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
 IR cabling: Many home networking vendors sell cables designed for car-
rying IR signals from remote locations back to the home theater.
 
 CAT-5e cabling: If you’re using CAT-5e cabling for audio and video dis-
tribution (using some of the systems we discuss in Chapter 19), you’ll 
find that these systems have a built-in capability to carry IR signals for 
remote controls. If you’re not using one of these systems but have put 
CAT-5e cabling in your walls when building your home, you can use extra 
(unused) CAT-5e cables in place of the IR cabling we just mentioned.
 
 RG6 coaxial cabling: Using special devices called IR injectors (available 
from vendors such as ChannelPlus, www.channelplus.com), you can 
carry IR signals over the RG6 coax that you use for distributing cable or 
broadcast antenna TV signals.
 
 You can’t use an IR injector on the RG6 cables used to connect a DSS 
dish to DSS receivers.
 
 Proprietary systems: If you opt to install a high-end automation system, 
such as those from Crestron (www.crestron.com), you need to use 
special proprietary cables from the manufacturer. For example, Crestron 
uses its own special cable called CrestNet.

Hooking Up Your A/ V System
In This Chapter
 Planning your gear layout
 Hiding wires
 Connecting to the receiver
 Making the video connection
 Adding PCs and gaming systems
 Powering your system
You’ve picked a room, collected all your A/V gear, opened the boxes, and 
oohed and aahed at your shiny new stuff. Now it’s time to get down to 
the work of hooking up your home theater. At first glance, this can seem like 
a daunting task. You have a lot of cables and connectors to deal with, and 
even experienced home theater folks may find the back of an A/V receiver 
confusing at first. The key is to take a methodical approach. With a few key 
concepts in mind, hooking up an A/V system can be easy and even fun!
 
In this chapter, we talk about where the various pieces and parts of an A/V 
system should go in your home theater and how they should be connected to 
each other. However, the advice we give in this chapter is generic. Although 
the majority of home theater components connect in a similar fashion with 
identical cables and connectors, there are always a few differences among 
different brands and models. For example, what we call CD Audio In might be 
labeled CD Line In or even Aux In on your receiver. For the exact terms and 
procedures that apply to your system, you need to read your manual.
 
Many home theater receivers have assignable inputs — inputs that can be 
used for different components and that let you customize which audio input 
and which video input work together (for example, letting your receiver play 
Component video 3 and Coaxial digital audio 2 when you watch your DVD 
player). This feature is great because it adds a lot of flexibility. It also adds a 
level of complexity because you’ll need to program those inputs (using the 
receiver’s onscreen display). If you are using a receiver with programmable 

262
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
inputs, we highly (highly!) recommend you spend a few minutes with your 
user manual, familiarizing yourself with the process. While we could probably 
program your receiver if you invited us over (and gave us a nice cup of coffee 
and maybe some donuts), it’s just about impossible to give you the precise 
steps you’ll need to take here.
Planning the Room Layout
After you’ve read those oh-so-fun manuals, you might think it’s time to start 
plugging away. The temptation is to get things hooked up and working. You 
want to watch a movie right now, admit it . . . so would we. But by devoting 
a few minutes to planning your next steps, you can make the process easier 
and get better results when the time comes to watch and listen to your 
system.
At a minimum, your home theater has six speakers (including the sub-
woofer). Each of these speakers plays a role in creating the illusion of being 
“in the action” when you watch movies or shows (or listen to multichannel 
audio on DVD-A or SACD). So you have to get the speakers in the right spots 
relative to your listening position. Incorrectly positioning your speakers cre-
ates gaps in the sound field that surrounds you. These gaps can be distract-
ing or downright annoying and can also cause room interactions that reduce 
the fidelity of the audio you are re-creating.
 
No matter what you do, your speakers are going to interact with your room, 
creating echoes and reflections that have some impact on the sound. The key 
is to reduce the negative effects of these interactions and, instead, use them to 
your advantage.
Getting the front speakers in place
The front speakers — left, right, and center — provide the bulk of the sound 
you listen to while watching a movie. One of the key jobs of these front speak-
ers is to provide a realistic reproduction of dialogue — you want people in 
the middle of the display to sound like they’re right in front of you, and those 
on the left and right to sound like that’s where they are. Proper placement of 
these three front speakers is essential in creating this effect and minimizing 
any gaps in the speakers’ coverage (so when dialogue moves from side to 
side, it does so seamlessly). Keep the following points in mind when setting 
up your front speakers:

263
 Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System 
 
 Set up your center channel speaker first. The placement of the left and 
right speakers depends on the position of your center speaker.
 
 Make sure the front surface of the center channel speaker is flush with 
the display. Most center channel speakers are designed to be placed 
directly on top of the display. Keep the front surfaces of both flush with 
each other to minimize reflections. If your equipment physically permits, 
you might try to get the front of the speaker (the baffle) in front of the 
surface of the screen. (This is hard to pull off in the real world, which is 
why we recommend just making them flush.)
 
 If you have a wall-mounted display (like a flat-panel plasma or LCD TV), 
you might have a hard time getting your center channel speaker flush 
with the display (unless you’re using wall-mounted speakers especially 
designed for such applications — which are becoming popular these 
days). Don’t sweat it; just try to keep the front of your center channel 
relatively close to the same vertical plane as the front of your display — 
don’t stick it too far out in front if you can avoid it.
 
 Keep the right and left channel speakers the same distance from your 
listening position as the front speaker. Some people place the three 
front speakers in a straight line across the front of the room. This actu-
ally makes the center speaker closer to you than the others, meaning 
that sounds from the center speaker reach you sooner than sounds 
from the others. Instead of a line, the front speakers should form an arc 
in front of you, in which each speaker is the same distance from your 
primary viewing position (or the middle of the viewing position, such as 
the center of a couch or the middle of a group of seats).
 
 If you’re using wall-mount speakers with a wall-mounted flat panel, 
you’re not going to be able to do this. Again, don’t sweat it; it’s not a 
huge deal as long as you take the time to “teach” your receiver where 
your speakers are when you configure it. Because these speakers will be 
a bit farther away from you than the center channel when you’re sitting 
directly in front of the display, you’ll simply have the receiver introduce 
a bit of delay in the signals sent to these speakers, so the sound arrives 
at your ears at the right time.
 
 Toe-in the left and right speakers. The front panels of the left and right 
speakers should be placed so that they are aimed directly at (or imme-
diately behind) your seating position. Many wall mounts allow you to 
angle the speakers this way.
 
 Some speakers are designed such that their front panels are already 
toed-in when the speakers are placed parallel to the wall. Check the 
manual that comes with your speakers to see if there are any recommen-
dations on toe-in.

264
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
 Place the left and right speakers at a 45- to 60-degree angle from the 
listening position. Start off with the speakers at the wider angle. Place 
each speaker 30 degrees to the right or left of the center speaker from 
your viewing position. If you find, while listening to movie soundtracks, 
that sounds seem unnatural and too widely spaced, you can move the 
right and left speakers closer to the screen. Conversely, if it’s hard to 
distinguish right from left from most seating positions, spread the speak-
ers a bit farther apart. When you do so, maintain the arc we mentioned.
 
 Place the speakers’ tweeters at or near the viewers’ ear level. Keep in 
mind the seated height of your viewers in the seating you’ve selected 
and adjust your speakers accordingly when selecting stands or wall 
mounting. Even if you have floor-standing speakers, you can buy small 
stands to raise the height, if necessary. If your center speaker is above 
you (maybe you put it on top of a gigantic RPTV), you can at least aim it 
down toward your listening position. Our first technical editor (who’s a 
genius at this stuff) likes to use rubber wedge-shaped doorstops under 
the backside of the center speaker to do this aiming.
Dealing with surrounds
Many people think of their surround-sound speakers as their rear speakers. 
Indeed, many receivers label the surround outputs as Rear, so people imag-
ine that these speakers need to be along the back wall, behind the listening 
position. This isn’t always the case — particularly with the bipole or dipole 
surround speakers, which are the most common kinds (we prefer dipoles).
5.1-channel surround sound
For 5.1-channel surround sound, we recommend that you place bipole or 
dipole surround speakers along the side walls (preferably mounted on the 
side wall). Position them even to or slightly behind your home theater seat-
ing, and about two feet above the listeners’ seated ear level. If you are using 
direct-radiating speakers for your surrounds, the best placement is behind 
the listeners, aimed so that they radiate (face, in other words) toward the 
back wall. That might sound a bit counterintuitive, but if you face them 
directly toward the listening position, you don’t get the diffuse surround 
sound that you’re looking for.
 
If your room layout supports it, you should place your surround speakers on 
either side of your primary viewing/listening position so that they are each 
within a 90- to 110-degree angle from your head — where straight ahead (look-
ing at the screen) is 0 degrees.

265
 Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System 
Other types of surround sound
If you’re using Dolby Digital EX or DTS ES, you have an extra speaker (or 
two) to deal with. These systems have side surrounds (which are placed like 
5.1-channel side surrounds) and center-surround channel speakers (one or 
two, depending on whether you’re using a 6.1- or 7.1-channel setup).
These center surround speakers should be placed behind the listener. 
In a 6.1-channel setup, they go directly behind the listening position. In a 
7.1-channel system, the two center surround speakers should be placed 
along the rear wall, on either side of the seating position.
 
In a 7.1 system, you should put each of the rear surrounds at an angle of 130 to 
150 degrees from your main listening position — again relative to your display 
being 0 degrees.
Placing the subwoofer for optimal bass
You’ll often hear people talk about low-frequency sounds being nondirec-
tional, which is a fancy way of saying that you can’t really locate where they 
are coming from by ear. Proponents of this concept will tell you that your 
subwoofer can be hidden well out of the way — under the proverbial end 
table, far away from the action. Subwoofers are nondirectional, to a degree, 
but putting your subwoofer too far away from the rest of your speakers (and 
from your listening position) can lead to situations in which you do hear 
where the bass is coming from. Indeed, if you move your subwoofer too far to 
the left or right, the bass isn’t well integrated with the sound coming from the 
other speakers. In most cases, it’s actually better to not hide the subwoofer. 
Treat it like any other speaker — show it off!
Many vendors recommend that you place your subwoofer in a corner. This 
placement reinforces the bass significantly, and we think this is a good place 
to start. However, in some rooms, you can get too much reinforcement of 
your bass in the corner, and you end up with boomy bass. What we mean by 
boomy is that the bass notes become indistinct; you just hear a low-frequency 
sound and can’t distinguish between the different frequencies. So if you’re 
listening to a recording of someone playing a Bach fugue on a pipe organ, you 
don’t hear the distinct notes in the lower register. If this happens to you, try 
moving the subwoofer out from the corner a bit.
 
One good (if slightly unscientific) way of finding a place for your subwoofer 
(after you have it hooked up, of course) is to swap places with it. Put the 
subwoofer right up where you sit and turn on some bass-heavy music (or a 
bass-heavy movie soundtrack). Walk around the room until you find the place 
where the bass sounds best. Now, swap back by putting the subwoofer in the 
spot where the bass sounded best.

266
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Figure 17-1 shows a typical 5.1-channel, surround-sound speaker configura-
tion. As we discuss in the previous sections, the center and front left and 
right speakers are equidistant from the viewing position, with the left and 
right speakers 45 to 60 degrees apart (or 22 to 30 degrees on either side of 
the display from your main viewing position). The surrounds are beside or 
slightly behind the comfy home theater seats, and the subwoofer is placed 
along the front wall of the room.

In a typical 7.1-channel configuration, the center, front, and surround speak-
ers are in the same location as they are in a 5.1 layout, but you’ve added two 
additional rear surrounds located farther behind the main listening position.
Hiding Unsightly Cables
One drawback of a surround-sound audio system is that having those speak-
ers alongside or behind your seating position makes hiding the speaker 
cables difficult. Now, some people out there love the look of fancy speaker 
wires. (Pat has a set of Kimber speaker cables that he just loves to stare at, 
though his two-year-old likes them for entirely unsafe play purposes.) But for 
most people, speaker cables are an unsightly reminder of all the work they’ve 
put into building their home theaters, and hiding these wires is a good thing.
The best way to hide cables, if you can pull it off, is to put them inside the 
wall. If you have a basement or attic under or over, respectively, your home 
theater room, using in-wall speaker cabling is pretty easy. Just make sure 
that you have the proper kind of speaker cable (UL-rated CL3 or higher) and 
that you use a thicker cable (lower gauge), such as 14- or even 12-gauge. See 
Chapter 16 for details about cables.

267
 Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System 
Sometimes, you just can’t get your cables in the wall. For example, Pat’s house 
(like many in southern California) doesn’t have a basement, and the ceiling 
over his home theater is raised to the roof (no attic access). In these cases, 
you can try to hide your cables under carpets or rugs. If that doesn’t work, 
you might consider installing a raceway along the baseboards of your room 
What about going wireless?
The ideal way to avoid dealing with hard-to-run 
and hard-to-hide speaker wires for the surround 
speakers in your 5-, 6-, or 7.1-channel surround-
sound system would be to dispense with the 
wires entirely, right? Heck, yeah it would be — 
if only it were that simple. Wireless speakers 
have been a bit of a holy grail for home theater 
manufacturers for some time, and a number of 
manufacturers are now shipping home theater 
speaker systems (or home-theater-in-a-box — 
HTIB — systems that included the speakers, 
receiver, and DVD player all in one package) 
with wireless surround speakers.
Wireless systems use a variety of RF (radio fre-
quency) systems to transmit the sound output 
from your receiver to the surrounds: Many use 
the Bluetooth technology in mobile phones, for 
example, others uses variations of Wi-Fi (the 
wireless networking built into your laptop or 
desktop PC), and still others use proprietary 
wireless systems (that work only within the 
closed environment of that manufacturer’s 
equipment).
Although the wireless connection may be built 
into the receiver and speakers, more often sys-
tems are sold as wireless ready, which means 
you buy an extra module or two (the wireless 
transmitter and receiver) and plug them into 
your receiver (the transmitter) and speakers 
(the receiver). A good example of this is Sony’s 
DAV-HDX279W BRAVIA Home Theater System. 
This HTIB system comes with a combined 
receiver/DVD player unit, five speakers, and a 
powered subwoofer (all for only $399). It’s wire-
less ready, and with Sony’s optional WAHT-SA1 
S-AIR wireless surround-sound speaker kit 
($179), you can cut those cords to the back of 
the room. Manufacturers such as Samsung and 
Panasonic offer similar kits.
Our experience with these systems is that they 
work just fine, but keep in mind that if you’re 
looking for a truly high-fidelity surround-sound 
experience, wires are always going to be 
better.
Another thing to keep in mind is that even though 
you won’t need speaker wires running to the 
back of the room with wireless surrounds, but 
you will need power — both to run the wireless 
receiver and also to provide amplification to the 
surround speakers (there’s usually an amplifier 
built into the wireless receiver module or into 
the wireless surround speakers themselves (in 
which case they’d be active loudspeakers as 
discussed in Chapter 12). So you’re not going 
to be truly wireless, just front-of-the-room-to-
back-of-the-room wireless.
If that particular pathway is your big problem 
(hey, we understand that all too well), you 
should definitely look into wireless systems. If 
you think you’re going to get away with just one 
plug in the front of the room and no other wires, 
well we hate to disappoint your, but you’re not! 
Wireless is getting a lot of attention from home 
theater engineers and designers, and wireless 
technologies themselves are advancing pretty 
darned rapidly (who here ran out to get a 3G 
iPhone the day they came out? C’mon, fess up!). 
Over time wireless will be a natural part of many 
home theaters. Today it’s a niche product for 
people with specific needs and requirements.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
that can contain the wires (the raceway can even be the baseboard itself, as 
long as there’s room for cables behind it) or using thin (but wide) flat cables. 
For example, Monster Cable (www.monstercable.com) sells flat speaker 
cables in its “Invisible out of wall” series. Taperwire (www.taperwire.com) 
also offers flattened versions of most wiring you find in the house — including 
speaker cables. These flat cables are hard to see when placed along your base-
boards and can even be painted to match your wall colors.
Attaching Components 
to the A/V Receiver
Getting your speaker cables and speakers mounted in place is a good first 
step. Hooking up the rest of your A/V gear is the next step. (Keep in mind 
that you might have to go back to the speakers and tweak the placement of at 
least some of them after everything is up and running.)
Spaghetti isn’t just what’s for dinner. It’s also what you get when you pull out 
all the cables you bought for your home theater components. There sure is a 
lot of wire behind the scenes in today’s home theater. (We hope that this will 
decrease over time as digital connections, such as HDMI, become more popu-
lar.) Luckily, any home theater worth its salt has a device — the A/V receiver 
or controller — that provides a central connection point for all these wires. 
Also, if you have a rack for your gear, the rack should have a good cable man-
agement system to help you out. We talk about racks in Chapter 20.
At the highest level, connecting components into your home theater is as 
simple as using the right cables to connect them to the back of your A/V 
receiver (or controller). With very few exceptions, you don’t connect other 
components directly to each other. Let your A/V receiver do its job!
 
Some folks believe that you get the highest-quality video signal by connecting 
your components’ video cables directly to the inputs on the back of the dis-
play itself, bypassing the video source switching functionality of the receiver. 
(Video switching is when you run all video into the back of the receiver and 
then let the receiver send the signal you want to view to your display.) For 
most folks, we think this isn’t worth the inconvenience — today’s receivers 
typically have very high-quality video switching circuitry, and most displays 
simply don’t have enough inputs anyway. We particularly believe that you 
should take advantage of your receiver’s HDMI switching and upconversion 
facilities if you have these features on your receiver. (Upconversion takes 
standard-definition signals and coverts them to a higher resolution for display 
on a high-definition TV.)

269
 Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System 
 
If your DVD player, set-top box, or satellite receiver (or other video source 
component) offers a digital video connection such as HDMI, and your display 
accepts these connections but your receiver doesn’t offer HDMI switching 
(your receiver probably doesn’t if it was built before 2008 — even many cur-
rent models don’t), we recommend that you ignore our previous advice and 
make those video connections directly, bypassing the receiver. In many cases, 
the quality of an HDMI signal is worth ignoring the convenience of receiver 
video switching.
Hooking up your speakers
The next step is to connect your speaker wires to the appropriate speaker 
outlets on your A/V receiver. This is a simple process, but there are a few 
things to keep in mind:
 
 Keep your speakers in phase. Each speaker wire consists of two con-
ductors, a positive and a negative. If you connect these out of phase 
(that is, the positive on the receiver to the negative on the speaker, and 
vice versa), you’ll hear a definite effect on your sound. Specifically, your 
speakers can’t create the appropriate soundstage, so sounds that are 
supposed to clearly come from the right or the left won’t. (By the way, 
right in this context means to the listener’s right when facing the display 
or the front of the room.) Most speaker cables are color-coded red and 
black to make this job easier (or you may have a white stripe on the 
jacket of one of the conductors in the speaker wire).
 
 Make sure you have a tight connection. For the best sound quality and 
for a connection that won’t stop working over time, make sure your 
speaker connections are solid. We like banana plugs or spade lugs on 
five-way binding posts because you can get these suckers nice and tight, 
but a bare wire can be just fine, and many smaller surround speakers 
don’t have enough physical space to fit larger connectors. Make a good 
connection the first time, and you won’t need to touch it again for years. 
We discuss these different connections in more detail in Chapter 16.
 
 Don’t forget to connect the subwoofer. Most subwoofers are active 
speakers (they have their own built-in amplifiers), so you don’t use 
speaker wires to connect them. You need a long analog audio intercon-
nect cable, which runs between the Subwoofer Out or LFE output on 
the back of your receiver and the input on the subwoofer itself. Make 
sure you get a cable that’s long enough to let you move the subwoofer 
around because you may need to reposition your subwoofer as you dis-
cover how it interacts with your home theater’s room.

Connecting to the A/V receiver
Take a look at the back of any typical A/V receiver, like the one shown in 
Figure 17-2. Wow, that’s a lot of jacks, huh? Well, they’re not all back there 
for show or to make the designer happy. They’re there to give you a flexible, 
home theater system that can do what you need it to do.

Each component in your A/V system has a set of audio connections or video 
connections or both to your A/V receiver. The receiver itself connects to your 
speakers and to your display (with another set of audio and video cables).
First, you connect audio interconnects and video cables to each source 
device. Remember the following:
 
 Keep your right and left in mind with audio cables. Any device that 
connects with analog audio cables has two connections (the cables 
themselves usually, but not always, come in attached stereo pairs). One 
jack (the right) is usually colored red, and the other is colored white. 
Make sure that you connect the left output on the source device to the 
corresponding left input on the back of your receiver.
 
 Use digital audio connections whenever possible. Use coaxial or opti-
cal digital audio cables to connect DVD players, game consoles, DSS 
receivers, or any source that has a digital audio output. If you want to 
use Dolby Digital or DTS with any of these sources, you must use the 
digital audio connection. The great thing about digital audio connections 
is that there’s just one — no getting left and right confused.

271
 Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System 
 
 Some folks feel that optical (Toslink) digital audio connections sound 
better than coaxial ones. We’re not convinced of this and recommend 
that you don’t get too wrapped around the axle on this — use what you 
have. If both types of connections are available on the device and the 
receiver and you have a preference, go with it. Otherwise, don’t sweat 
this too much.
 
 Keep track of which connections you use on your receiver. One nice 
thing about the standardized connections used in home theaters is 
the fact that you don’t have to “color inside the lines.” It’s fine to plug 
sources into jacks on your receiver with labels that differ from the 
device you’re plugging in. For example, if you have a video game console 
(but no corresponding Game inputs on your receiver), you can plug 
the game console into those Laser Disc Player inputs — assuming, of 
course, that you don’t have a laser disc player in your system. This is 
where keeping track of your connections comes in handy. To send the 
audio and video from the game console to your speakers and display, 
you have to select the laser disc input on your receiver. You might even 
want to make a little cheat sheet to keep near your system (with all your 
little home theater quirks written down), so the rest of your family can 
run the system.
 
 As we mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, fancy A/V receiv-
ers and controllers often have assignable inputs that let you select 
the names that correspond with each set of inputs on the back of the 
receiver or controller. In many cases, you can even “type” custom input 
names into your receiver’s display by using your remote so that you 
can see the right input name on the front of your receiver or on your 
onscreen display. This is a handy feature to have, especially when some-
one unfamiliar with the system is using it.
 
 Use an extra set of audio and video cables to connect your recording 
systems. Your receiver has an extra set of A/V output connectors that 
correspond with its VCR inputs (usually labeled VCR1, VCR2, and so 
on). When you connect your VCR or PVR (personal video recorder) to 
these inputs, use an extra set of cables to connect the receiver back to 
the inputs on these sources (labeled Audio In and Video In on the back 
of the source). This lets you route audio and video through the receiver 
for recording purposes. (You may not be able to record DVDs this way 
because of DVD’s Macrovision copy protection system, which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 6.)
 
 Use the highest-quality video connections available to you. If you can 
use digital video connections (HDMI or DVI), do! Otherwise, use com-
ponent video if your sources have these connections. If you must, use 
S-video for sources that don’t have component video connections, such 
as DSS receivers. Some sources (such as many VCRs) have only 
composite video connections.

272
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
After you’ve connected all your sources to the receiver, you can connect the 
receiver to your display unit by using one or more video cables (we discuss 
this shortly) and a set of analog audio interconnects.
Using this set of audio cables between the receiver and the display may seem 
to be a bit of cabling overkill. After all, you already have a surround-sound 
audio system connected to the receiver. We find that, sometimes, we just 
want to use the built-in speakers in our display, like when we flip on ESPN 
to catch the college basketball scores, and then turn the TV back off. If you 
don’t think you’ll ever do something like this, you can skip this step.
 
If you’re using an HDMI connection between your receiver and display, you 
might be able to skip the step of adding an analog audio connection to the 
display. HDMI cables can also carry digital audio, so there’s no need for sepa-
rate audio connections. You can skip the analog connection, however, only if 
your receiver is connected only to HDMI sources (not common, but becom-
ing more likely if you’re going all HD) or if the receiver has an upconversion 
feature that takes non-HDMI sources and sends them to the display over the 
HDMI connection.
A step you won’t want to skip is connecting the receiver to your display with 
video cables. This can be a somewhat tricky proposition — the first step you 
need to take here is to understand whether your receiver has any upconver-
sion or conversion capabilities (see the sidebar called “Upconversion and 
conversion, what gives?”). Many receivers these days will upconvert com-
posite and S-video sources (such as non-HDTV cable boxes and VCRs) so 
that their signals can be sent to your display over component video cables. 
A growing number of receivers will even upconvert composite, S-video, and 
component video signals to HDMI, which is a really cool feature!
 
We refer to conversion and upconversion generically as upconversion in this 
chapter (it’s more common to see receivers that do upconversion than just 
plain format conversion). But in terms of plugging your home theater together, 
it makes no difference.
If your receiver can upconvert, you can simply connect the receiver’s video 
outputs to the inputs on your display by using component video or HDMI 
cables (depending, of course, on which kind of upconversion — component 
or HDMI — your receiver offers).
 
If your receiver doesn’t handle upconversion, you need to have one set of 
video cables for each kind of input you make into the receiver. So, for example, 
if you have a VCR connected via composite video, a game console connected 
via S-video, and a DVD player connected via component video, you need to 
have one of each of these types of connections running out from your receiver 
to the display.

273
 Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System 
 
If you connect a source to your receiver with an S-video or composite video 
cable but use only a component video cable to connect the receiver to your 
display, you’ll find that you get sound but no picture when you try to play that 
source. In the HDTV world, this is something you’d probably never do (you’d 
be using component video or HDMI), but we’ve seen it happen, so we wanted 
to warn you.
You don’t need multiples of these video connections between the receiver 
and the display — just one connection for each type of connection you have 
coming into your receiver. So if you have three component video sources 
running into the back of your receiver, you need only one set of component 
video cables running to your display.
Getting television signals
TV comes into your system from a cable TV service, a DSS satellite dish, or 
an antenna for broadcast TV (or in some cases, from a combination of these 
devices). Regardless of the system, an RG6 coaxial cable connects these TV 
sources into your system.
Upconversion and conversion, what gives?
We talk about upconversion a lot in Home 
Theater For Dummies. In short, upconversion 
(which can occur in a DVD or Blu-ray disc 
player, inside a home theater, or inside an 
HDTV itself) is simply a scaling of one resolu-
tion of video to another higher resolution. Every 
HDTV does this itself — if you send a 480i or 
480p standard definition video (from broadcast 
TV or a DVD) to your TV, the TV will use scaler 
circuitry to change (raise) the resolution of the 
video it receives to the native resolution of the 
TV (usually 720p or 1080p). 
Inside a receiver, a little more is going on. First, 
a receiver may do a format conversion, where 
it takes a video signal entering the receiver on 
one type of connection (for example, an S-video 
signal from a VHS or older gaming console) and 
change that signal to an HDMI or component 
video signal at the same resolution. (This is 
usually called analog-to-HDMI conversion or 
component video conversion.) If the receiver 
also changes the resolution of the video signal 
when it does that, well then it’s doing analog-
to-HDMI upconversion (or component video 
upconversion).
You see both systems on the market, and they’re 
both incredibly handy when you are assembling 
and connecting your home theater. Since your 
HDTV will already upconvert incoming sig-
nals, there’s no need to do upconversion in the 
receiver, but many folks prefer this if they’re 
buying a fancy receiver, simply because they 
feel the upconversion (scaling) circuitry in their 
receiver does a better job of upconversion than 
does their TV.

274
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
If you use an antenna for non-HDTV over-the-air broadcast TV (or for non-
digital cable without a converter box), this connection is usually simple. Just 
connect the coaxial cable coming out of your wall outlet to the Antenna/
Cable In input on the back of your display. (Note: Your cable company may 
have installed a similar RG59 cable instead of an RG6 cable; if you’re running 
your own cable, we recommend you use RG6.) If you have a PVR or VCR, run 
the cable coming out of the wall to it first, and then to the inputs on the back 
of your TV.
If you have digital cable, an analog cable with a converter, or a DSS dish, or 
if you’re picking up over-the-air broadcast HDTV signals, you need to run the 
RG6 cable to the appropriate set-top box, DSS receiver, or HDTV tuner. These 
devices are connected through your A/V receiver, just like any other source 
device. You can use the receiver to send the video from these sources to 
your VCR for recording (if it’s allowed).
 
If you’re using broadcast HDTV and you have a true HDTV (with an integrated 
tuner), you can connect the coaxial cable running from this antenna directly 
to the back of your display.
Similarly, if your display is digital cable–ready (or DCR) and can use a 
CableCARD, you can connect the coaxial cable from your cable TV feed 
directly into your TV and forgo the cable set-top box. As we discuss in 
Chapter 7, this is convenient but means that you won’t be able to access 
some digital cable features, such as video-on-demand (VoD) or the onscreen 
program guide.
 
If you have digital cable, you may want to route your cable signal through 
the PVR or VCR before you connect it to your set-top box. Many digital cable 
systems transmit a number of standard analog channels that your PVR or VCR 
can tune in to. Routing this cable through the PVR/VCR lets you record those 
analog channels while your set-top box is tuned to a different channel (analog 
or digital) for simultaneous viewing.
Adding your gaming console 
or Home Theater PC
Very few A/V receivers have made provisions for connections from game con-
soles or Home Theater PCs (HTPCs). Although these devices are too new to 
have been incorporated into most receiver designs, that’s no reason to give 
up hope. You can still get these devices hooked into your surround-sound 
system and display.

275
 Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System 
The key thing to keep in mind is that HTPCs and game consoles are no differ-
ent from any other source device. They have analog and digital audio connec-
tions. They have composite, S-video, and (in many cases) component video 
outputs. Your receiver doesn’t care whether these signals come from a DVD 
player or an HTPC. Neither does your display.
So connect these devices just as you connect any of the other source devices 
we mentioned earlier in this chapter. Keep the same rules in mind: Use digital 
audio connections, if you can, and use the highest-quality video connection 
system that the device supports.
As we hinted at earlier in this chapter, you probably won’t find any inputs 
on the back of your receiver marked HTPC or Xbox. So find an unused set of 
inputs and use them.
 
If you have one of those fancy touch-screen remote controls that we discuss 
in Chapter 15, you may be able to program the remote to use the name of the 
device you’re using. So even if the HTPC is connected to the VCR2 input on 
your receiver, you can make the remote button say “HTPC.” With this setup, 
the babysitter can easily use your home theater. (We’re not sure whether or 
not that’s a good thing.) If your receiver has assignable inputs, you may also 
be able to change the labels that show up on the front panel of the receiver 
and the TV’s onscreen display — customizing them to match what you’ve 
plugged in to a specific input.
Powering the Network
After you’ve made all the connections, the temptation to plug everything into 
the wall and get going is strong. Hold off for one more step: making the power 
connections safely. We’re not talking about your personal safety here, but the 
safety of your equipment. You probably forgot about power cables, but you 
should have some plans for these, too. There are lots of them, and they cer-
tainly get in the way.
You’ll have to confront two big issues: the number of connections and the 
quality of the connections (or, put another way, where to plug your home 
theater gear in and how to keep that gear from getting fried).
You will simply have way more power cables than you think. The great thing 
about power management is that you can add connections as you need more 
with few issues. So if you need more outlets, no problem — just add some more 
outlets in the form of power strips. The overall power usage of your home the-
ater is relatively light compared with, say, a dishwasher, so in general, connect-
ing several home theater devices into one outlet is not a huge problem.

276
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
Some home theater components — high-powered receivers or power ampli-
fiers and large displays — do draw a lot of current. It’s always best to plug 
these items directly into your surge protector (which we discuss next). Other 
items, such as DVD players or CD players, can safely be plugged into either 
the surge protector or into one of the auxiliary outlets on the back of another 
piece of equipment (many receivers have such outlets).
Two kinds of outlets are used on the back of receivers: switched and 
unswitched. Switched outlets turn on and off with the receiver, while 
unswitched outlets are always on. Keep that distinction in mind if you have 
something plugged into your receiver’s power outlets that you want to use 
even when the receiver is turned off.
 
The bigger issue is surge protection. Electrical currents are like water cur-
rents; they flow up and down, and if they get too high (a surge), it’s a problem. 
(If they get too low [a brown-out], that’s a problem, too.) You need to consider 
professional-class surge protection (not what you buy at Wal-Mart). One good 
lightning strike can toast your home theater (and not in a good way). Leviton 
(www.leviton.com), for example, has a Home Theater Surge Protector that 
has nine outlets plus a neat expandable modular outlet that can handle surge 
protection for telephones, modems, faxes, DSL modems, cable modems, com-
puter LANs, and satellite and cable TV systems.
 
If you are building from scratch or have the luxury of adding some outlets, put 
in electrical lines that are dedicated to your home theater and that go straight 
to your electrical panel so that no intermediate devices can cause in-home 
surges on your lines.
In general, we also advocate whole-home power protectors that can help 
groom the power coming from the street. That’s where some of the big 
surges can come from, and these surges can hit not only your home theater 
but everything else in your home. We consider these $300 to $800 “first line 
of defense” units a must for any home. They sit between all the electrical 
lines coming in and your electrical panel, truly stopping any problems before 
they get to your house. You can find models that also protect your satellite 
and cable connections at the home level, too. You can get these from Leviton 
and other electrical suppliers.
We talk more in Chapter 21 about power conditioning, which is the next step 
up after surge protection. Power conditioners use various techniques to 
restore your A/C power to a true 60 Hz, 120-volt signal and can offer better 
audio and video performance.

e strongly believe that you should spend time thinking about how 
to exploit your investment in your home theater by taking it whole 
home. In many instances, you’ve already done the hard part by deciding that 
a home theater is worth the big investment. Now, telling you to take it to the 
limit (oops, Eagles pop culture reference) by going whole home — expand-
ing your home theater’s audio and video capabilities to other parts of your 
house — shouldn’t be tough.
The point of this chapter is to expose you to some of the varied ways you can 
accomplish whole-home networking of your audio and video gear. If you’re 
serious about this (and you know what’s coming here — shameless self-
promotion time!), we absolutely insist you think about getting our Smart 
Homes For Dummies book (Wiley) because it goes into all the requisite details 
for you to do this by yourself.
 
In this chapter, we talk in detail about some whole-home wiring systems that 
we recommend you install when you build or remodel your house. For most 
folks, the installation of whole-home wiring is not a casual project. If you don’t 
have a whole-home wiring system in place and can’t put one in, don’t freak 
out! We also talk about some solutions that use wireless networks or existing 
wires in your wall to expand the reach of your home theater components.

278
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Introducing Whole-Home Entertainment
Let’s talk about what it means to go whole home. If you read Chapter 2, you may 
recall that you need to plan around two major concentrations of equipment:
 
 Wiring hub: This is generally the place where nearly everything comes 
into the house from the outside. The electrical panel is likely there, 
along with your incoming telephone lines, your cable or satellite service 
connections, and maybe your cable or DSL modem if you were smart 
and planned ahead. Ideally, most of your in-home communications and 
information services are connected together in this area, with home 
run wires running throughout the house in a hub-and-spoke fashion. 
(In a home run wiring system, each outlet has a dedicated wire running 
directly to it from the wiring hub.)
 
 Media hub: You can consider the main home theater to be your media 
hub. Most of the gear we discuss in this book resides in the media hub, 
either on shelves out in the open or in a configuration where you have 
some gear in the open and some in a nearby equipment closet or rack.
When you go whole home, equipment also resides in your media hub and in 
other rooms around your house. For example, Danny has a kids’ computer 
lab where four computers are clustered so that his two sets of twins (he has 
always been an overachiever) cannot fight over the computers to do their 
homework online. (Actually, Pat knows they are secretly playing Civilization 
and MathBlaster.)
In most cases, you are likely to have gear spread all over the house, particu-
larly in the master bedroom, where you might have another TV, VCR, and 
cable/satellite receiver (maybe even another surround-sound system) and 
potentially something in the kids’ rooms.
So the question — and opportunity — is how can you link all your gear to 
minimize your costs (yes, you can save money by not having to buy a PVR or 
a satellite receiver for each room) and exploit your investment in your media 
hub? Well, have we got some ideas for you!
 
Think about what whole home means for you. Although you can grow your 
whole-home network, you can save money in the long run if you have a better 
idea of what you want to do up front. After you’ve already built the network, 
adding things can be more expensive. There’s a world of difference between 
running an extra set of speakers to the bedroom or dining room for your audio 
and wanting to have background music in every room. If your whole-home 
plans are limited, you can almost always get inexpensive (under $100) devices 
from Radio Shack (www.radioshack.com) or SmartHome (www.smart
home.com) that can meet these needs.
But if you want to have more flexibility to mix and match in any room, or to 
have higher-quality connections, you may want to think about looking into a 

279
 Chapter 18: Plugging In to a Whole-Home Entertainment Network 
whole-home distribution panel for your signals. These panels, also called struc-
tured cabling systems, can support voice, data, and video distribution in the 
home relatively cheaply. You can get a good panel for under $1000 and then 
add jacks and wiring accordingly.
Not all distribution panels are alike. Some are for one specific application 
(such as video), and others allow you to select whatever you want to put on 
any connection. For example, a CAT-5e–based system (using that standard 
computer-network cabling) might let you put phone, computer data, video, 
or audio on any line. You merely change the outlets at the terminating end 
according to your needs in that room.
 
You can find a list of structured cabling vendors on the Web site for our book, 
Smart Homes For Dummies. Check it out at www.digitaldummies.com.
At a bare minimum, a structured cabling system should provide
 
 A flexible telephone network using high-quality, unshielded twisted-
pair (UTP) phone cabling and a modular, configurable termination 
system in the wiring closet (the central location where all of these sys-
tems are connected together)
 
 A computer network of CAT-5e (the standard for Ethernet computer 
network cabling) UTP cabling for data networking
 
 A centrally distributed coaxial cable (usually RG6 — the standard 
video cabling) network for distributing video signals
 
 An all-in-one modular termination panel to neatly terminate all this 
network wiring in your wiring closet
 
 Customized wall outlet plates to provide connectors for your phone, data, 
audio, and video outlets that can be easily changed and reconfigured
Connecting to a Whole-Home 
Audio System
Whole-home audio is a pretty simple baseline that a lot of people consider 
when moving out of the home theater and into the other parts of the house. 
After all, the first step can be as easy as merely stringing another set of 
speaker wires from your multizone-capable A/V receiver (we talk about these 
in Chapter 11) in your home theater to, say, remote speakers located in the 
dining room. Keep in mind, however, that the limitations of a whole-home 
audio network are based on the limitations of your A/V receiver. Most A/V 
receivers that have multizone capabilities can support audio in only one or 
two other rooms — not zones in every room in the house.

280
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
So if you want a true whole-home audio system, you probably need to con-
sider installing additional equipment in the media hub (or nearby). With this 
equipment in place (and the appropriate wires in the wall), you can share 
the audio source devices in your home theater with any room in the house. 
In almost all cases, this system provides stereo (two-channel) audio, not 
surround-sound (multichannel) audio, in rooms outside your home theater. 
The sidebar, “The trouble with whole-home surround sound,” talks about this 
issue a bit more.
You can get audio from your home theater to other rooms in the house in 
four primary ways:
 
 Use your receiver: As we mentioned earlier, many receivers (at least 
above the $500–$600 price range) include multizone functionality that lets 
you run speaker wires or a long audio RCA cable pair. You can really run 
these only into an adjacent room, not the entire length of the house, due 
to signal loss. This is the simplest way to get audio elsewhere in the home.
 
 Buy a whole-home audio distribution system: These systems come in 
both multizone and single-zone-versions (we explain the difference later 
in this chapter) and use their own amplifiers and control systems to 
send audio to any room in the house. You can buy whole-home audio 
systems that support up to eight or more rooms.
 
 Use a CAT-5e audio-distribution system: These systems can distribute 
line-level stereo audio signals over standard CAT-5e computer network 
cabling. Many of these systems are designed to carry both audio and 
video. Some (such as the SVC-10 from ChannelPlus, www.channelplus.
com) can even carry the higher-quality S-video signals and digital audio 
signals (such as Dolby Digital) over this network cabling. Most of these 
systems, however, can carry only composite video and stereo audio.
 
 Use a wireless audio-distribution system: Two types of wireless audio-
distribution systems are available:
 
• Remote speaker systems: Many receiver manufacturers now offer 
an option for wireless speakers in remote rooms. So if you want to 
be able to hear the TV when you walk into the kitchen, you can use 
a wireless remote speaker. These systems are usually similar to 
(or even identical to) the wireless surround speakers we discuss in 
Chapter 17. They’re just used for a different purpose in a different 
room.
 
• Whole-home wireless audio-distribution systems: These systems 
are designed to take audio from your PC or home theater or both 
and distribute it to remote speaker locations throughout the home. 
An example of this is the Sonos Music System (www.sonos.com), 
which we’ll talk about later in this chapter.
 
Many of the CAT-5e and wireless audio-distribution systems we are about to 
discuss can also carry video signals.

 Chapter 18: Plugging In to a Whole-Home Entertainment Network 
Some of the whole-home audio network systems that we talk about use 
CAT-5e cabling, and we expect (in the not so distant future) to see systems 
that can distribute surround-sound audio around the house digitally using 
this cable. Until these systems become available, however, we think it’s best 
to stick with good, old-fashioned two-channel stereo for whole-home audio 
networks.
Zoning out: Single-zone versus 
multizone systems
After you start sending audio to a whole-home audio network, you have some 
decisions to make. The biggest decision is what you want to listen to in differ-
ent parts of your house. No, we’re not talking about what CDs you’re going to 
play, but rather what kind of flexibility your system has to play different audio 
sources in different parts of the house simultaneously.
In a single-zone audio system, you have only one audio source distributed to 
every endpoint across the network at any given time. You can turn various 
sets of speakers on or off, but you don’t have the ability to listen to different 
audio sources in different parts of your house at the same time. A multizone 
audio system, such as the one shown in Figure 18-1, allows one family member 
to listen to, say, a CD in the family room while another person listens to the 
audio channel of a DVD in his or her bedroom. Some multizone systems let 
you get really fancy and share source devices in multiple locations through-
out the home, while others distribute audio sources from one location to 
multiple places in the home — in other words, some play equipment from 
your home theater anywhere, while others play equipment from all over the 
home in any room you choose.
The trouble with whole-home surround sound
The stereo audio standard, in which sound is 
separated into two channels (left and right), still 
dominates music production. With the advent 
of home theater, however, music can now be 
produced using multiple channels to drive a 
multitude of speakers.
For the average home (read that as a nonmil-
lionaire home), we recommend that you don’t 
add multichannel capabilities to your whole-
home audio network — at least not right now. 
Although you can build an audio network that 
goes beyond the two-channel (stereo) limit 
today, the network quickly becomes extremely 
complicated and prohibitively expensive. We 
think the best way to create a second multi-
channel surround system is to simply install a 
second, standalone surround-sound system in 
that other room. If you’re just trying to get sur-
round sound in a bedroom or kid’s room, you 
might consider an inexpensive home-theater-
in-a-box solution that will give you surround 
sound for only a few hundred dollars.

Single-zone systems are easier and cheaper to build, but obviously less flex-
ible than multizone systems. The good news is that the basic architecture 
(the wires you put in your walls) is usually the same for both types of sys-
tems. So you can install an inexpensive single-zone system and then upgrade 
your equipment to multizone later on.
Using speaker wires to build 
an audio network
The traditional way to expand an audio network is to simply extend in-the-
wall speaker wires from your home theater or media center to remote loca-
tions in your house (anywhere you want to have audio). Remember that you 
need to use UL-rated CL3 speaker wires — given the distances traversed by 
these wires, we recommend 14-gauge or smaller wires. Refer to Figure 18-1 
for a look at a simple multizone audio system. Chapter 16 explains cables and 
wires in more detail.
If your A/V receiver has multiroom capability, you can connect these speaker 
wires directly to your receiver by using a device called an impedance-matching 
system (which we describe in more detail in the sidebar, “A word about 
impedance-matching systems”). This device is necessary when you are con-
necting more than one pair of speakers to a single pair of speaker terminals 

283
 Chapter 18: Plugging In to a Whole-Home Entertainment Network 
on a receiver or an amplifier — if you’re just hooking up one set of speakers 
to that multiroom output, you can skip the impedance-matching system.
A better way to use those speaker wire connections to multiple remote rooms 
is to use a special-purpose, multiroom, integrated amplifier. This device con-
tains individual pairs of amplifiers for each remote pair of speakers, so you 
don’t need an impedance-matching system, and you get plenty of power (and 
volume) in remote rooms. You can get multiroom integrated amplifiers in both 
single-zone and multizone configurations. These integrated amplifiers are avail-
able from companies such as Niles Audio (www.nilesaudio.com).
 
If you want to create a relatively inexpensive two-zone audio system, look for 
a multizone A/V receiver that has line-level outputs, instead of speaker-level 
outputs, for the second zone. With these systems, you can simply plug the 
receiver into a single-zone, multiroom, integrated amplifier using a pair of 
standard audio interconnect cables. Your home theater is zone 1, and the rest 
of your house is zone 2. It’s not as good as a true multizone system, but it’s a 
lot cheaper and easier to set up.
Besides a centralized amplifier/control system and speaker wires in the wall, 
you need to install speakers in the remote rooms. Most folks decide to use 
in-wall speaker systems (often placing these speakers in the ceiling), but you 
can also install speaker terminal wall jacks and then use standard loudspeak-
ers. You connect the loudspeakers to these wall jacks just as you might 
connect them to the back of a receiver.
Connecting source devices to a multiroom system
Most audio source devices (such as CD play-
ers) have only one set of audio outputs on the 
back, and you probably already have this set 
connected to your A/V receiver. So how can 
you also feed this audio into a separate multi-
room amplifier system? There are two options 
(besides buying a second CD player).
The easiest (and cheapest) way to do this is to use 
a Y-splitter audio cable that splits a single pair of 
stereo audio signals into two pairs. One branch of 
the Y goes to your A/V receiver, and the other to 
your multiroom system. You can buy these cables 
at Radio Shack and similar retailers.
Some multiroom installations use separate 
amplifiers for each zone. In these systems, you 
need more than a simple two-for-one split from 
a Y-splitter. The solution here is to use a signal 
distribution amplifier. This device takes the 
output of a source device, splits it into multiple 
outputs, and then amplifies these outputs to 
ensure that your signal is not degraded. (If you 
split the signal without amplifying it, it could be 
too weak and would cause distortion that you 
would hear as a background noise or hiss.) This 
is the best approach if you are using separate 
amplifiers for each remote pair of speakers.

284
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Controlling whole-home audio with IR
The other big challenge for a whole-home audio system is controlling your 
A/V components from remote rooms. Remember that most A/V components 
use IR (infrared) remote control systems, and that IR doesn’t travel through 
walls and other obstacles. So you’ll need a remote control system that can 
carry IR signals from IR sensors (that you simply aim a remote control at) 
or wall-mounted volume controls and keypads in your remote rooms. These 
whole-home IR systems typically require special three-conductor IR cabling 
but can also be carried over other cables, such as CAT-5e computer network 
cables or even over the RG6 coaxial cables that carry video signals around 
the house from an antenna or a cable TV service.
You need a few components to connect a whole-home IR system together:
 
 IR sensors or keypads in remote rooms: These are the end of the line 
for your IR network. Each run of IR cable terminates in one of these 
devices. IR sensors and keypads send IR control signals over the IR 
cabling as electrical signals.
 
 An IR connecting block in your media hub: This device connects to the 
other end of the IR cable runs and concentrates the IR signals they carry 
into outputs that can control your A/V components. You need a connect-
ing block because you want only one IR input connected to each com-
ponent in your system, but you have IR sensors or keypads in multiple 
rooms. The connecting block allows, for example, the IR signals coming 
from five different rooms to be sent to a single CD player.
 
 IR emitters (IR blasters): These devices run from the connecting block 
to the components themselves. IR emitters have only one function 
in life: They convert the electrical control signals back into IR (light) 
signals that A/V components can understand.
Building a whole-home IR distribution system is a relatively complicated pro-
cess. The hardest part is programming keypads and getting the right IR sig-
nals to the right A/V components. We highly recommend that you work with 
a professional installer if you want to implement a whole-home IR network.
 
CAT-5e or wireless audio distribution systems can often carry IR control sig-
nals for you, so you won’t need a separate IR network.
Plugging into CAT-5e
Aside from speaker cabling, you have other whole-home audio cabling 
options, such as CAT-5e. Systems from a variety of manufacturers can suc-
cessfully carry line-level audio signals (the signals carried over audio inter-
connects) over CAT-5e cables in your walls. On the inexpensive end, you 
can get systems that convert the left and right line-level outputs of an audio 

285
 Chapter 18: Plugging In to a Whole-Home Entertainment Network 
device into a balanced signal. If high-end is your thing, go all the way with 
full-fledged, expensive audio-distribution (and video-distribution!) systems 
that provide true multizone audio over CAT-5e.
You can distribute audio signals around the home using CAT-5e in three 
major ways, which we discuss in the following sections.
Point to point with baluns
Baluns are deployed in pairs for point-to-point use — meaning that they send 
a signal from one place to a single other location (as opposed to a point-to-
multipoint system, which can send a signal to multiple different locations). 
A balun is just a little passive device (meaning it doesn’t need any external 
power), about the size of a deck of cards, with receptacles on both sides (an 
RJ-45 on one side and two or more RCA jacks on the other).
One balun is associated with the source device (such as a CD player or the 
Audio Out ports of a receiver). This balun connects through an RCA audio 
interconnect to the left and right Audio Out channels. Then, you plug the 
balun into the CAT-5e cable by using a CAT-5e patch cable. At the other end 
of the network — down another leg of your home’s CAT-5e that you’ve dedi-
cated to audio — the process is reversed. The second balun plugs into the 
RJ-45 outlet on your wall (again using a patch cable), and then plugs into the 
left and right Audio In jacks of the remote amplifier or receiver that you’re 
feeding the signal to. An example of one of these products is MuxLab’s Stereo 
Hi-Fi Balun (www.muxlab.com).
You can also find baluns that can distribute digital audio signals — such as the 
bitstream outputs of DVD players and other Dolby Digital or DTS sources — over 
CAT-5e cables. In many cases, these baluns can carry high-quality component 
video signals as well. An example of such a product is Intelix’s V3AD HDTV 
Component Video and Digital Audio over CAT-5 Balun (www.intelix.com). 
These units can connect to any source device with component video and coaxial 
digital audio outputs and send the signal over up to 1000 feet of CAT-5e cabling.
 
Most folks find that this sort of balun is most useful not for sending signals 
to a second room but rather for use within a larger home theater room. For 
example, if you are trying to hide your source components in a closet or 
equipment room on one side of a large home theater room and are installing a 
display and speakers rather far away, you can use inexpensive CAT-5e cabling 
and baluns rather than running more expensive audio and video cables.
Single-zone CAT-5e audio-distribution systems
In the world of audio and CAT-5e, the next step up moves beyond the point-
to-point limitation of baluns and provides a single-zone audio-distribution 
network to multiple locations throughout the home. These systems, from ven-
dors such as Russound (www.russound.com) and Leviton (www.leviton.
com), typically use custom faceplates (the plastic plates that cover standard 
wall outlets) that replace standard RJ-45 faceplates in each room. These 

286
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
faceplates have a pair of female RCA audio jacks that can connect to any 
standard audio source device or amplifier/receiver. In the room containing 
the source device you want to share throughout the home, you simply plug a 
stereo audio patch cable between the device and the faceplate.
In remote rooms, you use an audio patch cable to connect the faceplate to the 
inputs of a local receiver or amplifier. Connecting these remote outlets is a spe-
cial CAT-5e audio hub located in your wiring closet. This hub takes the source 
signal and distributes it to every other CAT-5e outlet connected to the hub.
Multizone, CAT-5e audio-distribution systems
If you want the utmost in flexibility and capability in a CAT-5e-based audio-
distribution system, you need a system that can carry different audio 
programs to different parts of the house simultaneously — a multizone, mul-
tisource system. Like the multizone speaker-level systems discussed earlier 
in the chapter, multizone CAT-5e systems are high-end solutions that offer 
the utmost in sound quality and convenience. Because sending audio over 
CAT-5e is still not a mainstream technology, it’s not cheap. You’ll probably 
end up paying $1000 or more for the components alone, and that doesn’t 
include the speakers and amplifiers or receivers in each room. And that price 
is for the (relatively) cheap versions of these systems. Some high-end sys-
tems can cost tens of thousands of dollars. You can get systems from players 
such as Crestron (www.crestron.com), Russound (www.russound.com), 
and Niles Audio (www.nilesaudio.com).
A word about impedance-matching systems
In Chapter 11, when we talk about A/V receivers, 
and particularly about their amplifier sections, 
we mention that many receivers have trouble 
dealing with speakers with an impedance (a 
measure of electrical resistance) of 4 ohms or 
less. This really comes into play in whole-home 
audio systems. That’s because when you try 
to drive two sets of speakers from the same 
stereo amplifier, the impedance of the speakers 
is effectively halved. That is to say, if you plug 
two sets of 8-ohm speakers into a single stereo 
amplifier, you end up with an effective imped-
ance of 4 ohms. Add a third set, and you’re in 
the danger zone for most receivers.
If you have a multizone audio-distribution 
system, impedance isn’t an issue (each pair of 
speakers has its own amplifier), but in a single-
zone system, many folks try to cram multiple 
pairs of speakers onto a single amplifier. The 
safe way to do this is to use an impedance-
matching system. These systems let you hook 
up two, three, four, or more pairs of speakers to 
a single stereo amplifier without the impedance 
dropping to an unsafe level. Keep in mind that 
the amplifier power provided to these remote 
speakers will be reduced as you add extra sets 
of speakers onto the system. So the impedance-
matching system will protect your amplifier, but 
you may not get enough power to reach the 
volume levels you want.

287
 Chapter 18: Plugging In to a Whole-Home Entertainment Network 
Going wireless
The most popular way of getting audio around the house without a dedicated 
network is with an RF (radio frequency) wireless system. These come in two 
main flavors:
 
 Wireless speaker systems connect to the line-level outputs of a source 
device or preamplifier and send the signal over a 900-MHz or 2.4-GHz 
channel to a pair of self-amplified stereo speakers.
 
 Wireless line-level distribution systems hook up to your source compo-
nents in the same fashion but send their signals to a receiver that hooks 
into your own amplifier and speakers on the far end.
One major potential difficulty with many wireless systems is that they use a 
line-level input — something that most source devices have only one of. So 
you may run into trouble hooking up a CD player, for example, to both your 
A/V receiver (or controller) for local listening and to one of these devices for 
remote listening. Luckily, many of these units also accept the output of your 
receiver or amp’s headphone jack, so you can avoid this problem if you have 
a headphone jack available. Alternatively, you can use one of the Y-splitter 
audio cables we mention in the sidebar, “Connecting source devices to a 
multiroom system,” earlier in this chapter. Prices for these wireless systems 
range from about $75 to $200.
A good example of a simple point-to-point wireless audio-distribution system 
is the Terk LF30S system by AudioVox (www.audiovox.com). This $99 
system will bring stereo audio (as well as a composite video signal) from 
your home theater to any other room in the home. You can even add a 
second receiver to bring the same audio to a second room.
The current state-of-the-art in wireless audio distribution systems involves 
systems that use 802.11 (Wi-Fi) wireless networking to distribute audio 
around the home. Our current favorite system is the Sonos Digital Music 
System (www.sonos.com). The baseline Sonos system (the Sonos Bundle 
130) starts at $999 and supports two rooms.
This technogeek’s dream system consists of a controller (the brains of the 
system), a “zone” player (the endpoints of the system where all the speaker 
and system interfaces are housed, as well as a four-port switch so that you 
can network other items in the vicinity — nice!) and matching speakers you 
can use if you want everything to match.
Most buyers of the Sonos system also buy a local NAS (Network Attached 
Storage) hard drive because the Sonos itself doesn’t have one — a non-NAS 
system just plays music found elsewhere, like on your PC. You can also 
have more than one Sonos zone player; the players talk to each other and 
the controller in a “mesh” fashion (meaning the signal can hop from station 
to station, rather than only radiating out from the main base station), so if 

288
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
you have a really long house, you can still use the Sonos system. In such 
instances, the Sonos system synchronizes the music so that it all plays at the 
same time, avoiding any weird echo-type sounds around the house. Sonos 
uses 802.11g for its wireless protocol — but doesn’t connect to your Wi-Fi 
access points (it creates its own “mesh” network) — hopping from Sonos to 
Sonos throughout your home.
Sharing Video Components 
throughout the Home
Sharing video in the home used to be a lot simpler a few years ago than it is 
today. This is largely due to the advent of all sorts of signal encryption as 
well as the introduction of digital transmissions into the mix. These have 
added their unique flies in the whole-home networking ointment.
You can share home theater video signals in your home (speaking generally 
here, of course) in four major ways:
 
 Use modulators to send your video over the coaxial cable carrying your 
antenna or cable TV signal
 
 Use a CAT-5e audio- and video-distribution system
 
 Use a wireless audio- and video-distribution system
 
 Use a system that carries audio and video over your existing phone wires
 
As the price of video source devices (such as DVD players) plummets, the eco-
nomics of creating a video-distribution network in your home turns on its head. 
A few years ago, when DVD players cost $500 apiece, it made sense to create 
a system that could share the DVD player in your home theater with TVs in 
other rooms. Now that you can buy a good quality upconverting DVD player for 
well under $100, most folks simply choose to have an extra set of video source 
devices in remote locations. You may, however, run into a situation in which 
you’d like to share some sources in your home theater with displays in other 
parts of the home — in the following section, we tell you how to do so.
Using your TV cables
Most structured cabling systems (complete prepackaged home wiring prod-
ucts) include a centralized video-distribution system. This system differs 
from the standard cable company installations in one big way. Most cable 
installations use a branch and tree architecture, with the cable coming into 
your house from the street and then being fed into a series of splitters — little 

289
 Chapter 18: Plugging In to a Whole-Home Entertainment Network 
“one in, two out” devices that split a cable signal into two branches. A central-
ized video-distribution system uses a special splitter, called a video-distribution 
panel, that splits the incoming cable (or antenna) signal into multiple lines run-
ning to all your TVs — each a home run cable in a hub-and-spoke architecture.
With a central video-distribution panel, you can create your own in-house 
television channels using modulators over your in-home coax cables. Simply 
put, a modulator takes the composite or S-video output of a video source 
device (as well as the stereo analog audio outputs) and transforms it into an 
RF (radio frequency) signal — just like a television station does. You simply 
set the modulator to broadcast over an unused channel and connect it to 
your video-distribution panel. When you want to watch that source some-
where else in the house, you just need to tune your remote TV to that station, 
and voilà!
Figure 18-2 shows a modulated signal (in this case, a VCR, but it can be any 
video source, such as a DVD player or a DSS satellite receiver).

Modulator systems don’t work for everybody. New digital cable systems are 
designed to use all or most of the available spectrum on your home’s coax net-
work, so carving out bandwidth for your piggyback data transmission is not so 
easy. In many instances, it’s almost impossible. You are likely better off pursu-
ing some of the nonmodulator alternatives we’re about to discuss instead.

290
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
CAT-5e and wireless systems
Many of the CAT-5e and wireless systems we discuss earlier in the chapter 
can carry video signals in addition to audio signals. In the case of CAT-5e sys-
tems, we think that you can actually get a higher-quality video signal around 
the house than you can with a modulator system. That’s because the pro-
cess of modulating and then demodulating a video source (when it gets back 
into your remote TV) tends to diminish your picture quality. Some of these 
CAT-5e systems can even carry component signals and digital audio for high-
quality video (even HDTV!) and surround-sound audio in remote locations. 
(You need an A/V receiver and surround speakers in these remote locations 
to take advantage of this.)
Connecting to Your Computer LAN
We talk in Chapter 2 about having a wiring closet for your Ethernet hubs and 
routers, in Chapter 6 about Ethernet ports on your DVRs, in Chapter 9 about 
gaming consoles with network interfaces, and so on. Computer networks are 
becoming an important part of your home theater infrastructure.
Accessing a whole-home computer network (also known as a local area 
network — LAN for short) opens up your home theater to any data point on 
your network. A good example is Danny’s AudioReQuest CD server. It has 
an onboard Web server that allows access to this music from wherever he 
Does your home theater need a phone connection?
In the age of broadband Internet connections, 
most telephone line connections that people 
used to have into their home theaters have 
gone away in favor of Internet connections. For 
example, gaming consoles used to use dial-up 
Internet for gaming over the network — now 
they use broadband Internet connections.
There is one place where phone lines may 
still be required: Satellite TV systems need 
to be able to “phone home” to authorize your 
account.
If you don’t have a phone outlet near your sat-
ellite receiver, you can get a wireless phone 
jack (such as RCA’s RC926) for around $80 
that uses the electrical lines in your house to 
transmit your telephone communications. You 
plug a standard telephone line into an adapter 
that then plugs into the electrical outlet at your 
home theater. Then, in a room where there is 
an available phone outlet, you do the same, 
only this time you run a phone cable from the 
electrical outlet into the phone outlet. Shazaam! 
One phone line. Do not use a wireless phone 
jack with a surge protector because this may 
block the frequencies over which your phone 
line communicates; plug the unit directly into 
the wall.

291

wants, in the house or over the Internet. He can synchronize his boxes in 
Maine and Connecticut because they are connected to the Internet. As soon 
as he finishes this book, he’s going to extend that to synching with his car 
stereos, too — over wireless computer network connections. The same is 
true with his SnapStream PVR. He can record programs while he is away and 
download them from anywhere on the planet. Now he can catch up on Weeds 
from Kiev!
 
Although we’ve not heard of anyone having this problem, it is possible that 
your ISP (Internet service provider) may forbid this kind of “server” connec-
tion. Most ISPs have absolutely frightening terms of service agreements that 
forbid just about everything but checking your e-mail and surfing the Web on 
your connection. Most of these agreements are not strictly observed, but if 
you start using a lot of bandwidth, your ISP may either make you stop or make 
you pay for a more expensive connection.
Getting your home theater devices to communicate with your computer net-
work is getting easier all the time thanks to newer technologies, lower costs, 
and equipment vendors’ increased experience with the consumer market. It’s 
getting to be almost automatic!
So, assuming this is the case, the question then becomes, “How do you inter-
connect with that LAN?” Well, it depends on the extent of your LAN, if it exists 
at all. Although we don’t have space in this book to discuss all the ins and outs 
of computer networking, we want to offer a little guidance to help you on your 
way toward a whole-home computing backbone that can make use of your 
home theater system. Here are a few networking points to keep in mind:
 
 You can carry data signals around your house in at least four major 
ways: CAT-5e cabling, wireless, electrical cables, and regular phone 
wiring and coaxial cables. We recommend, if you can do it, that you run 
new CAT-5e cables through your walls to the places where you want it. If 
you use CAT-5e for your audio or video distribution, you are likely build-
ing a new home or renovating your current one, and running the cable 
shouldn’t be a problem. A wired infrastructure gives you much higher 
data rates, more reliability, and more flexibility for the future — and it 
can add to the value of your home.
 
 Wireless options are great. These are quickly coming down in price, 
and you can build a home data network just by adding a wireless access 
point to your network. (A wireless access point is a base station of a wire-
less network — think of it as the equivalent of a cordless phone base sta-
tion.) You then bring your devices online by adding PC cards (which plug 
into standardized PC card slots on the device) or USB-based dongles (or 
adapters) that plug into the USB ports. Most devices follow the 54 Mbps 
802.11g wireless standard, and a few use the newer (and better suited 
for video) 802.11n standard, which provides speeds of up to 300 Mbps 
and can also use different frequencies (which are less crowded with 
cordless phones and the like).

292
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
 
 If you have a piece of equipment that has an Ethernet connection (and 
no built-in Wi-Fi) and your network is wireless only, you can pick up an 
inexpensive Wi-Fi to Ethernet Bridge (often called a Wi-Fi gaming adapter). 
These devices have Wi-Fi built-in and an Ethernet port on the back, and 
they do exactly what their name implies — bridge between the two net-
works. They’re exceedingly handy things to have in a home theater. A 
good example of a Wi-Fi Ethernet bridge is WET54G from Linksys ($89, 
www.linksys.com).
 
 You can transmit signals over electrical cables, too. The trick here is 
to use low-cost devices that conform to the HomePlug AV standard — a 
standard networking protocol for Ethernet connections using AC power 
lines. This standard allows speeds up to 200 Mbps, but speeds vary 
substantially based on where you plug in the devices and what is turned 
on at any particular time. A great example of a HomePlug-based system 
designed for moving audio and video around your home comes from 
the folks at Belkin (www.belkin.com). The $179 Powerline AV+ Starter 
Kit (not yet on the market but due out soon) can support up to three 
Ethernet connections by simply plugging the two adapters in the kit into 
your wall. Pretty cool. Want to add a room? Plug in an electrical module. 
Done.
 
 Check out www.homeplug.org for more information about this new 
standard and for product availability.
 
 You can also use the coaxial cables and phone lines in your house to 
send signals from room to room. A few networking systems use unused 
higher frequencies on the cable to send the data, so you can still talk on 
the phone or watch video at the same time. This is based on the Home 
Phoneline Networking Alliance (HPNA) standards. In general, the other 
options we mention are preferable to HPNA at this time, but new, faster 
versions of HPNA have been promised. Check out www.homepna.com 
for information about product availability.
 
 Some new systems use coaxial (cable TV) cables to send data around 
the house. MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance, www.mocalliance.
com), for example, can provide speeds of up to 200 Mbps over these 
cables. Another similar technology, TVnet by Coaxsys (www.coaxsys.
com), provides speeds of up to 70 Mbps. MoCA and TVnet are not prod-
ucts you can just go out and buy at the store, however. Instead, they are 
being built into devices, such as cable set-top boxes, to allow cable com-
panies to send TV signals between boxes in the home.
 
 If you have a high-speed cable, DSL, or satellite Internet connection, 
you have your high-speed Internet modem located somewhere on 
your network. It doesn’t matter where you put the modem, from the 
home theater perspective, because there really is no specific reason 
why the broadband Internet connection has to be located in your the-
ater room. In fact, most people like to put their modem either close to 
their computing area or in the wiring closet, out of sight.

293
 Chapter 18: Plugging In to a Whole-Home Entertainment Network 
 
 You need a router if you want to support multiple Ethernet devices 
on one network and have them interface with the Internet. Often, the 
DSL/cable/satellite modem is also a router. The router has a built-in hub 
that enables you to interconnect multiple data lines.
 
 If you are going to be routing video or large files over your LAN, con-
sider getting an Ethernet switch instead of a hub. In this way, you can 
make sure you get all the bandwidth you need for a quality transmission. 
(Most routers include an Ethernet switch, but you may need an external 
switch with more ports if you have lots of devices on your network.)
Although many vendors will try to push you into one solution (“You need 
Wi-Fi.” “No, you need HomePlug.”), you might find that these various net-
works can complement each other. We think a wired CAT-5e network should 
be the basis of your computer-LAN infrastructure (and phone network, and 
maybe even your audio and video network). But we also think that all the 
data-networking technologies can be used in concert when you build a whole-
home network.
Just for fun, here are a few examples:
 
 Build a wired Ethernet LAN but add a Wi-Fi access point in your living 
room for cordless, sofa-based Web surfing.
 
 Use Wi-Fi as the basis for your home-computer LAN, but use HomePlug 
or HPNA to extend your network to access points in distant locations 
out of reach of your primary base station (such as by the pool).
 
 Use wired Ethernet for your computers, but use a HomePlug system 
to connect your Xbox to the broadband Internet connection for online 
gaming.
We could keep this list going and going, but we think you get the picture. 
Think creatively and use wired and unwired technologies together to get 
your LAN wherever you need it to go.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Par t V
Let ting Your Home 
Theater Be All 
It Can Be

In this part . . .
T
his part is all about what to do after everything is put 
together. First, we discuss how to use the controls on 
your video systems (your television and your video 
source devices) to get the best picture possible.
We also discuss how to tweak your audio system so that 
you can adjust it to the dynamics of your home theater. 
Our friends in the installation business are constantly 
amazed at how bad good audio gear can sound if it’s not 
set up properly. Conversely, even modestly priced gear 
can sound great if it’s properly tweaked.
We also talk about ways you can improve your home the-
ater’s environment. If you think about it, home theater is 
really all about creating light and sound that you can inter-
act with. If you keep environmental lights and sounds from 
interfering with your theater, you can get more enjoyment 
out of your gear.
Finally, we talk about the high end of home theater and 
how to go all-out in pursuit of a home theater experience. 
And if you have budget limitations, you can at least get a 
preview of the future of home theaters.

etting your A/V system hooked up can be a bit of a challenge, but it’s 
rewarding to have all that “on your hands and knees” plug-fest work 
behind you. You have to take one more step, however, before you sit back 
and really enjoy your home theater. You need to spend some time tweaking 
your system — adjusting the video display and getting your surround sound 
set up properly.
In this chapter, we discuss ways to calibrate your system. This may seem 
like overkill to some folks, but it is critical. Joel Silver, the president of the 
Imaging Science Foundation — these folks know a thing or two about set-
ting up home theaters! — tells us that more than 90 percent of home theater 
displays are set up incorrectly. With a few tools, you can be part of the small 
percentage of home theater owners who are getting the most out of what 
they’ve paid for.
Calibrating Your Video
We’ve said it before — and we’ll say it again, because it’s important — most 
displays come from the factory improperly calibrated. The brightness and 
color are set at unnatural levels to make the displays stand out on the show-
room floor (in a brightly lit store). At these settings, if you put them in a dark-
ened home theater, the picture looks awful.
 
If you have a plasma display, you have an additional reason to calibrate your 
video: The overly bright settings that most of these units come with can 
reduce the life span of your display! Even if your display is not brand new or 
not all that fancy, a calibration can breathe new life into your picture quality.

298
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
On your average display, you (as a nontechnician) can make five adjust-
ments. A few sets let you adjust more, and service techs with the proper 
manuals and codes to get into the service menus of the display can adjust 
just about anything. But an average person (like you or us) can adjust the fol-
lowing controls:
 
 Contrast (white level): Don’t confuse this with contrast ratio, which we 
discuss earlier in the book. (It’s the ratio between the brightest and 
darkest images a display can create, if you didn’t get to that part of the 
book yet.) In terms of display adjustments, your contrast control adjusts 
the white level, or degree of whiteness, your screen displays. You see, 
in video displays, whites and blacks are measured on a scale called IRE 
(Institute of Radio Engineers) units, which are represented as a percent-
age: 0 percent is black, and 100 percent is white. You can actually drive 
your TV beyond 100 percent if your contrast is improperly set. If you do 
this, white portions of your picture tend to bleed over into the darker 
portions surrounding them.
 
 Brightness (black level): Now to throw in a counterintuitive statement. 
The brightness control on your display actually adjusts the black level 
that you see on the screen. Weird, huh? If the black level is set incor-
rectly, you can’t discern the difference between darker images on your 
screen.
 
 Sharpness: The sharpness control adjusts the fine detail of the picture — 
its ability to display minute details on the screen. If the sharpness is set 
too low, you have a fuzzy picture; if it’s set too high, your picture appears 
edgy, often with blobs around the edges of objects instead of clearly 
defined lines.
 
 Color: Along with tint (which we discuss next), color is one of the two 
controls that let you set the balance of the colors (finally, a name that 
says what it means!) on your display. If your color setting is too low, 
images begin to appear as black and white. If it’s too high, images take 
on a reddish tinge (for example, Nicole Kidman’s face will turn as red as 
her hair).
 
 Tint (hue): On most TVs, this control is labeled tint, but a few are more 
technically correct and call it hue. The tint control adjusts your display’s 
color within a range between red and green — your job will be to find 
the perfect balance between them.
Almost every display we know of has an onscreen display that shows the 
status of each picture setting as you are changing it. Typically, you’ll find a hor-
izontal bar across your screen; a vertical hash mark shows your current setting 
or the entire bar moves left or right as you increase or decrease, respectively 
that particular picture attribute. Some displays also have a numeric display 
(usually running from 0 to 100) that shows your current setting.

299
 Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System
 
We like the numeric displays because writing down a number is much easier 
(if you want to re-create a setting in the future) than trying to remember 
exactly how far across the screen a particular bar was.
Using a calibration disc
The best way to adjust your video is to use a DVD home theater calibration 
disc. We consider these discs (which cost about $50) to be an absolutely 
essential investment in your home theater. Unless you’ve had a professional 
calibrate your system (or you’ve spent so much on everything else that you 
can’t afford the disc), we think you simply must get one of these discs. (And 
no, no one is paying us to say that.)
The most common home theater calibration discs are the following:
 
 Digital Video Essentials HD Basics: The Digital Video Essentials (DVE) 
DVD (discussed in the next bullet) has long been considered the defini-
tive consumer-accessible (as opposed to professional) calibration disc. 
The same folks have the first (and, as we write, only) high-definition 
calibration disc. DVE HD Basics provides a suite of audio and video 
calibration tools and tests in a Blu-ray disc format with options for both 
1080p and 720p displays. DVE HD Basics can be found online at www.
videoessentials.com, and costs $29.95.
 
 You don’t need a high-definition disc to calibrate a high-definition TV. 
So if you’ve not yet got a Blu-ray disc player, you can do a good job of 
calibration with one of the DVD-based systems discussed next. If you do 
have a Blu-ray disc player and you don’t already own a calibration DVD 
(or even if you do!), you should strongly consider HD Basics as your cali-
bration disc.
 
 Digital Video Essentials: This is the definitive calibration DVD. One cool 
thing about Digital Video Essentials is the inclusion of video footage that 
you can watch to see the results of your adjustments with actual video, 
instead of just on a test pattern. Digital Video Essentials lists for $24.99 
and is widely available online.
 
 The folks at Joe Kane Productions (who created Digital Video Essentials) 
also have a six-disc professional set called Digital Video Essentials 
Professional, which retails for $350 and includes some high-definition cal-
ibrations (using the Windows Media system for high-definition 720p and 
1080i signals). Like the Avia PRO, this is probably overkill for most folks 
(you can probably have a pro calibrate your display for less money), but 
we wanted to let you know this was out there.

300
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
 
 Avia II: Guide to Home Theater: Available from Ovation Multimedia 
(www.ovationmultimedia.com), this disc contains a ton of great 
background material about home theater. It explains a lot of the same 
stuff we talk about here in Home Theater For Dummies. It also has a 
series of easy-to-follow onscreen test patterns and signals that let you 
correctly adjust all the settings we discuss in the preceding section. It 
also gives you test tones to help calibrate your surround-sound audio 
systems (which we discuss in a moment). This disc runs $49.99 directly 
from Ovation.
 
 A high-definition Blu-ray disc version is due out from Ovation sometime 
in 2008.
 
 We suspect most folks will find it to be overkill, but Ovation also pro-
duces a professional-quality variant of its test disc, the Avia PRO. This 
$250 set consists of seven DVDs and an elaborate user manual for the 
ultimate in calibration.
 
 Monster/ISF HDTV Calibration Wizard DVD: Monster Cable (makers of 
those famous audio and video cables) teamed up with the folks at the 
Imaging Science Foundation to jointly create their own calibration DVD. 
Like the other DVDs we discuss, it’s loaded with audio and video test 
signals and programs, and uses a “follow along” wizard-style interface. 
Monster and ISF’s disc is widely available online and at www.monster
cable.com and retails for $29.95.
 
 Sound & Vision Home Theater Tune-up: This one is also produced 
by Ovation Software, but in conjunction with Sound & Vision magazine 
(one of our favorites). In addition to general display calibration, this 
disc includes tests that demonstrate aspect ratios and let you test your 
S-video and component video outputs on your DVD player (to see which 
works better in your system). You can find the disc (priced at only 
$21.95) at http://shop.soundandvisionmag.com.
 
 While we think this disc is still useful, we don’t believe that it’s been 
updated in quite some time. We’re not not recommending it, but we 
wouldn’t be surprised if the folks at Sound & Vision either discontinued 
this disc or created a new high-def version.
We like all five of these discs and would be hard pressed to recommend one. 
As we mentioned, if you have a Blu-ray disc player, it makes sense to con-
sider the DVE HD Basics disc. Otherwise, you’ll probably get a good calibra-
tion from any of the other discs.
 
When you buy one of these discs, you’ll notice that one or more colored filters 
(they look like a pair of those cardboard 3D glasses used in movie theaters) 
comes in the package. Don’t toss your filter in the trash on the mistaken 
assumption that it’s an especially pretty piece of packaging — you need this 
filter when adjusting some of the color and tint settings on your display. You 
look through the filter to block out certain light frequencies.

301
 Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System
Using one of these discs is a simple process — one we don’t try to re-create 
here step-by-step because the onscreen audio and text instructions do a 
better job than we can in a book. Before you adjust any of these settings, 
get up off your comfy home theater seating and close the blinds! Ambient 
lighting has an immense effect on what you see on your screen (regardless 
of what type of display you have). So lower the blinds, close the door, and 
dim the lights. You want to adjust your picture in exactly the same lighting 
conditions you’ll have when you sit down to play movies or watch TV in your 
home theater. Then just follow the instructions on the DVD, step-by-step. It’s 
easy and even kind of fun.
When you’re done, you’ll notice that your picture looks different. (We sure 
hope it does!) It’s going to look darker. If you’re not used to a calibrated video 
picture, this might be a bit disconcerting. Give yourself some time to get used 
to it, though, and you’ll notice a more detailed picture, a picture that looks 
more like the movies. And isn’t that what you’re after in a home theater?
 
Some displays come from the factory either pretty well calibrated or with a 
picture mode you can select on your remote that will set your picture close 
to the state it would be in after you manually calibrated it. Sony displays are 
famous for this (Sony calls this its Movie mode), and other manufacturers 
such as Pioneer, Panasonic, and others have followed suit. A number of high-
end manufacturers are now offering HDTVs that are precalibrated to Imaging 
Science Foundation standards — although these TVs may still be in that 
super-bright showroom mode when you buy them, they have a calibrated set-
ting stored in a bit of nonvolatile memory (which means you can’t erase the 
settings) that can be turned on when you buy the TV. You still may want to 
tweak the display a bit with a calibration disc, but it’s handy to have your dis-
play be 99 percent of the way there with the push of a single button (or right 
out of the box).
Using an optical comparator
If you want to get really fancy with your home theater calibration process, 
you might consider not relying on your eyeballs and instead use a tool such 
as optical comparators or colorimeters. These devices are simply machines 
that can analyze the colors and patterns on a screen with a much higher 
degree of accuracy than you’ll be able to do with your naked eyes. Both 
devices do essentially the same thing (measuring your display’s light output); 
generally speaking colorimeters are less expensive for mere humans, while 
optical comparators are expensive tools typically used only by professional 
display calibrators.
 
Using an optical comparator or colorimeter can be especially useful if you are 
one of those folks with some degree of color blindness (which can include, 
depending on which study you believe, up to one in twelve men).

302
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
For the most part, these color-sensing devices are too expensive for the aver-
age home theater — you can buy a 50-inch, high-definition plasma TV for the 
price of many common hardware kits. For example, Ovation Multimedia’s 
OpticONE system, a popular hardware and software solution, retails for 
$2,200. Consequently, many folks turn to professional system calibrators (dis-
cussed in the upcoming section, “Hiring a professional”) who can amortize 
this investment over a number of customers.
But there are solutions that are in the price range of mere mortals, such as 
ColorVision’s Datacolor Spyder3TV colorimeter ($199, www.colorvision.
com). (The SpyderTV is so named because it has spiderlike suction-cup legs 
that stick to your display — ignoring the fact that it has three legs, not eight!)
To use the Spyder3TV you simply stick the unit’s suction cups to the front of 
your display and then plug the USB cable running out of the Spyder3TV in to 
your computer (Windows 2000 or XP is required, and a laptop is a lot more 
convenient for this task but is not required). Then place the supplied test 
pattern DVD in your DVD player, and you’re ready to start.
 
For flat-panel plasma and LCD displays, the Spyder3TV includes a special 
suction-cup attachment device — you’re not supposed to use the suction cups 
built into the three legs of the Spyder3TV for these kinds of displays.
After everything is hooked up, you just need to follow the steps included 
in the Spyder3TV software running on your PC (it comes on a separate CD 
with the rest of the Spyder3TV gear). Have your display’s remote handy and 
follow the onscreen steps to tweak your TV’s display settings. This all takes 
40 minutes or more, so have a little patience (that’s one reason why the pros 
charge hundreds of dollars to do a calibration), but the end result should be 
a better and more lifelike picture.
 
Although we didn’t have a big issue with this personally, some folks have com-
plained that it’s tricky to get the Spyder3TV attached to your display. You may 
want to consider mounting the unit on a tripod in front of your display if the 
suction cups don’t work well for you.
Other tuning system options
If you haven’t had a chance to get your hands on one of the home theater 
calibration discs but still want to improve your picture, you can do a couple 
of things.
One way to get a subset of the video tests on these discs is to play a movie 
DVD that contains the THX Optimizer. You find this somewhere in the 
disc’s main menu (usually in the Special Features section). Like the discs 
we described earlier, the Optimizer walks you through a series of steps to 
adjust your display (and your audio system). All THX-certified DVDs released 

303
 Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System
since 2000 (including Pat’s daughter’s favorite, The Lion King) include the 
THX Optimizer. You can find more details, including instructions on THX’s 
Web site (www.thx.com/home/dvd/optimizer/index.html). Now if he 
could just teach her to calibrate the plasma for him. Maybe when she turns 
five she’ll take over the task. (If it could be done on the Wii, she’d already be 
there!)
With this program, you still need that blue filter; if you didn’t get one with the 
DVD itself (and you probably didn’t), you can get one for free from THX by 
filling out the order form online. (You do have to pay a couple of bucks for 
shipping and handling.)
We recommend that you at least rent one of the movies on the THX Web site 
so you can use the Optimizer. You can adjust your video just by eyeballing it. 
Until you get a test disc in your system, you should, at a minimum, turn down 
the brightness until the level is about 
1⁄3 across your screen, but using a test 
disc or the Optimizer is much, much easier and more accurate.
 
One way to get your display dialed in at least somewhat close to an optimal 
calibration is to read the posts about your particular TV or monitor on the 
AVS Forum Web site (www.avsforum.com). Many models have ongoing 
threads for owners, and you’ll often find other people’s calibration advice 
within these forums. Remember that not every unit is going to be exactly the 
same. (There are always at least minor variations in manufacturing, and over 
time, the settings can change a bit — for example, as a projector’s light bulb 
gets dimmer.) But you can at least find out what works for other folks and try 
it out as an initial setting until you do a more formal calibration.
Hiring a professional
You may decide — either right up front or after you realize that you just 
can’t handle that remote control very well — that you want a professional to 
calibrate your display. Well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, if you 
can afford it, we highly recommend that you consider having a professional 
calibrate your system. They have tools (such as light meters) that you don’t 
have, and their calibration is more precise and ultimately better than any-
thing you can do with a calibration DVD and your eyeballs.
 
If you have a CRT front-projection system (these aren’t common any more — 
you can’t buy a new one, but there are a lot of them still out there in people’s 
homes), you really must have a professional set it up. You’ll waste tens of 
thousands of dollars if you don’t. In fact, if you’re buying any high-end display 
(such as that $17,000, 61-inch, HDTV plasma display Pat has his eyes on — 
don’t tell his wife!), go for a professional calibration. When you start getting in 
this price range, you should expect this kind of service from your home the-
ater dealer. A professional calibration usually costs between $200 and $500, 
depending on what type of display you have.

304
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
If you go with a professional calibration, make sure you choose someone who 
has been certified and trained by the Imaging Science Foundation, or ISF (we 
mentioned them earlier in the chapter). The ISF has trained (and continues to 
train) thousands of home theater dealers in the art of system calibration. You 
can find a trained calibration professional near you by searching ISF’s Web 
site at www.imagingscience.com.
Don’t call ISF directly asking them to calibrate your system. Those folks know 
how to do it, but they’re in the business of training others, not coming over 
to your house.
Adjusting Your Audio System
Just as your display needs a tune-up to look its best, your A/V receiver (or 
A/V controller, if you’ve gone with separates) needs a once-over to ensure 
you get the best possible sound from your home theater. You need to do the 
initial setup to make sure that your A/V receiver knows what kind of speakers 
you’re using, and then you need to adjust the amplification levels for each 
speaker.
 
Get out your A/V receiver’s manual before you start doing any of the stuff we 
recommend. Your particular receiver may have different (but similar) termi-
nology. The manual can also help you navigate your receiver’s setup menu 
system.
Great DVDs to put your system through its paces
After your video system is calibrated and ready 
to go, it’s time to start watching some movies. 
Why not enjoy the view with some classics and 
with some newer movies that can really test the 
limits of your system’s capabilities? For some 
reason, most home theater enthusiasts love 
action movies (but hey, who doesn’t?) and trot 
out their well-worn copies of Terminator 2 and 
The Matrix. These are indeed fun to watch in 
your home theater and can be demanding discs 
(The Matrix, in particular, seemed to overpower 
many early DVD players), but you also might 
want to check out some other films that show 
off your home theater in subtler ways. The ISF 
(yep, the same guys we mentioned elsewhere 
in this chapter) has a list of films that it recom-
mends to its affiliated dealers as great demo 
discs. You can find this list online at www.
filmsondisc.com/ISF_Reference_
DVD_Program.htm. You may even be sur-
prised to find favorites like Muppets from Space 
and Wayne’s World — excellent!

305
 Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System
Managing bass
Your A/V receiver sends low-frequency sounds to your subwoofer through 
its LFE (or low-frequency effects) channel. Subwoofers are very good at one 
thing — reproducing bass notes — and not much good at anything else. In 
general, you want to send only the lowest possible frequencies to the sub-
woofer because you want to minimize the use of the subwoofer for relatively 
higher frequencies.
At the same time, you must balance this requirement with the needs of your 
other speakers. If you have a set of small bookshelf speakers for your center, 
right, left, and surround speakers, and they can’t reproduce bass notes very 
well, you’re better off letting the subwoofer handle nearly all the bass.
 
You need to set the speaker size for each group of speakers — center, front 
(or main), and surrounds. So step 1 in setting up your audio is to go to your 
A/V receiver’s setup or configuration menu and navigate to the menu that lets 
you select your speaker size. You typically have a choice of Large or Small. 
The Small setting cuts off the low frequencies that are sent to your main 
speakers (the speakers other than your subwoofer) at a higher frequency than 
does the Large setting. In other words, the Small setting sends almost all low-
frequency audio signals to the subwoofer, whereas the Large setting sends the 
low frequencies to both the subwoofer and your other speakers.
 
You’ll probably find a setting in this menu for the subwoofer — an On or None 
setting that indicates the presence or absence of the subwoofer. Make sure 
you select On if you have a subwoofer.
You can use two criteria to select a setting for your speakers:
 
 Frequency range of your speakers (best): If you have access to the 
manufacturer’s data about your speaker, find out the frequency range at 
which the manufacturer rates its speakers. (You may also find this infor-
mation from a reviewer who has tested the speakers.) If the low end of 
the speaker’s frequency response is rated below 40 Hz, set your receiver 
to the Large setting; otherwise, use the Small setting.
 
 Woofer size (not as good): If you don’t know how low your speakers can 
go, you can use the size of your speaker’s woofers as a rule of thumb. If 
the woofers are 6 inches or larger, try the Large setting; otherwise, go 
with the Small setting.
 
If you don’t know either of these things (you can always take off the speaker’s 
grill and measure the woofer), start off with the Large setting. You can always 
switch over to the Small setting if you notice that your main speakers aren’t 
handling the bass very well. (In other words, they’re causing audible distor-
tions with low-frequency audio tracks.)

306
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
 
If you don’t have a subwoofer in your system, make sure you set the front 
speakers to the Large setting and set the subwoofer control to Off. Even if 
your other speakers are small, you need to select Large here, or you’ll get 
absolutely no bass from your system.
Setting up surrounds
After your speakers are put in the right place (see Chapter 17) and turned 
on and you’ve selected sizes, it’s time to configure your surround system. 
You need to configure two settings, which we describe next and then expand 
upon in greater detail later in this section:
 
 Delay: If all your speakers are the same distance from your listening 
position, sounds emanating from them arrive at your ears at the same 
time. That’s a good thing because delays in the arrival of sounds can 
ruin your sound field. You want sounds to have delays only when the 
director of the movie intends it (such as when a footfall echoes behind 
you). If speakers aren’t equidistant from the listening position, your A/V 
receiver can compensate with its own delay settings.
 
 Channel balance (or level): Set the sound level of each speaker so 
that you hear an equal volume from each speaker during testing. If one 
speaker (or set of speakers) is too loud, you experience an unbalanced 
sound field while listening to your system. (When you play back actual 
movies or music, the volume coming from each speaker depends on the 
volumes encoded in the source material.)
 
A growing number of A/V receivers have a built-in calibration tool that uses 
either a microphone that’s built into the receiver itself or (more commonly) an 
accessory microphone that comes with the receiver or that you buy separately. 
These systems let you skip all the steps that follow by simply invoking the auto-
calibration command on the receiver. A computer in the receiver sends out test 
tones and automatically adjusts the receiver’s settings. Some people think that 
they can do a better job manually — with an SPL meter, discussed in the next 
section, or with the audio portion of one of the video test discs discussed previ-
ously — but for the average person (and by that we mean anyone who’s not an 
audio geek!), these automated calibration systems are a lifesaver.
Setting the delay
Depending on your A/V receiver, you’ll find two ways to set the delay: You 
can enter either a distance or a delay time (in milliseconds). In either case, 
get a tape measure and measure the distance from your listening position 
to each group of speakers (center, front, and surround). You should have to 
measure only one speaker from each group, because the left and right speak-
ers within a group should be equidistant from your listening position. If your 
receiver uses distance, simply enter the number of feet that you’ve just mea-
sured for each group of speakers.

307
 Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System
If the receiver uses delay settings in milliseconds, things get a bit more com-
plicated. Typically, the delay settings are measured in relation to the main 
(right and left) speakers, so you enter a delay for the center channel and for 
the surround channel (or channels in 6.1- or 7.1-channel systems). To do 
this, compare the distance of the group you are setting to the distance of the 
main speakers. If the speakers are farther away, you typically set the delay to 
0 milliseconds (because the added distance will naturally add a delay — so 
you don’t want to artificially increase this delay). If they are closer than the 
main speakers, you set the delay to 1 millisecond for each foot. For example, 
if your main speakers are 9 feet from your listening position, and your center 
channel is 7 feet away, set the delay for 2 milliseconds.
Adjusting the channel balance
Your A/V receiver will have a special test tone mode designed for setting 
your channel balance. In this mode, the receiver generates a series of tones 
(at an equal amplification level) to each individual speaker in your system. 
The tone comes out of only one speaker at a time and shifts from speaker to 
speaker (either automatically or when you press a button on the remote con-
trol). The goal of this test is for you to set the level of each individual speaker 
until you hear an equal volume from each speaker.
 
Even though this test tone starts off with an equal amplification level for each 
speaker, you probably will hear a different volume level on the first round of 
the test. That’s because different speakers have different sensitivities. (We dis-
cuss sensitivity in Chapter 12; it’s a measure of how loud a speaker plays with 
a given power input.) Even if you had five identical speakers in your home 
theater (with the same sensitivity), their distance from your seating position 
and their acoustic interactions with the room can affect the volume you hear 
at your listening position.
As you run through your receiver’s test mode, you can adjust the volume 
level of each individual speaker. Most people can do a good job at this by 
using their ears alone. To get your channel balance really nailed down, 
consider purchasing an inexpensive sound-level meter (known as an SPL — 
sound pressure level — meter). You can get a good one for under $50 from 
Radio Shack (www.radioshack.com). With a meter in hand, you can get an 
accurate channel balance setting. An even better approach is to mount the 
meter on a tripod at your seating position — that’s how the pros do it.
 
The test tones are also a good check to make sure your speaker wires are 
hooked up to the right speaker terminals on the back of your receiver (or 
power amplifier if you’re using separates). The receiver’s display (or onscreen 
display) tells you what speaker you should be hearing each tone from. If the 
display says left surround and you hear a tone from your right surround, you 
know that you’ve made a mistake! Don’t ask us how we know this one.

Dealing with old-fashioned stereo sources
Although most movies are designed for surround-sound listening, music is 
generally recorded in stereo and mixed, edited, and produced for systems 
with two speakers. CDs, radio, cassette tapes, and LPs are all stereo record-
ings. In the audio-only realm, only DVD-Audio and SACD provide multichannel 
surround sound–ready recordings. Indeed, not all these recordings are multi-
channel, as many SACDs are stereo-only.
If you take a look around your home theater, you’ll see that you have at least 
five speakers (not counting the subwoofer). What’s an audiophile to do?
Well, most A/V receivers let you select whether you want to listen to stereo 
recordings in stereo, or direct, mode (through the front left and right speak-
ers) or in a surround mode (using all your speakers). Which you use is your 
preference. A/V receivers can use Dolby Pro Logic II (for 5.1 channel sys-
tems), Pro Logic IIx (for 7.1 channel systems), or a custom surround mode 
(discussed later in this chapter) to artificially create surround effects for 
these stereo recordings.
We prefer playing back our CDs and other stereo sources in the stereo mode. 
It just seems more realistic to us. If you like the surround modes, feel free to 
use them. It’s your theater, so use it the way that makes you happiest.
 
Most TV shows are broadcast in stereo, and many older movies on DVD or 
VHS are stereo as well. For movies and TV programming in stereo (not in 
Dolby Digital or DTS), we like to use Dolby Pro Logic II/IIx to create surround 
sound.
Using test discs
The home theater calibration discs we discuss 
elsewhere in this chapter — such as the Avia 
II disc — are for more than just adjusting the 
video settings on your display. They also have 
relatively robust and elaborate audio setup sec-
tions that can supplement the test tones built 
into your receiver.
For example, in addition to test tones for setting 
channel balance, the Avia disc has a test that lets 
you verify the phase of each of your speakers. 
Just follow the instructions on the screen, and 
you can find out if you’ve accidentally wired 
one of your speakers with the negative and 
positive terminals crossed. You can even do 
more advanced tests, such as checking for 
room interactions with your speakers (if you’re 
working on tweaking your speakers’ positioning 
in the room) and voice matching, which helps 
you decide whether certain speakers work well 
together.

309
 Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System
Playing with custom surround modes
As we discuss in Chapter 11, A/V receivers and controllers use devices called 
DSPs (Digital Signal Processors) to decode surround-sound signals. These 
DSPs are basically powerful computer chips that can do all sorts of neat 
manipulations of audio signals. They’re designed to tweak signals, not crunch 
numbers like the computer chips in your PC.
Many receiver manufacturers — the majority of them, to be honest — have 
harnessed this computer horsepower to create custom surround modes (or 
DSP modes), which manipulate the audio signal and create artificial surround-
sound modes. These custom surround modes use computer-generated 
models to adjust the volume and delay of signals coming from the surround 
and center channels to reproduce different “venues.” For example, some 
receivers have a mode that tries to re-create the ambience of a cathedral by 
reproducing the delays and echoes you’d hear in a cathedral.
Most audiophiles despise these custom surround modes, feeling that they are 
artificial and just get in the way of the music. We tend to agree; but again, this 
is an area where we leave you to your own devices. Feel free to play around 
with these modes and see what you think. We won’t come to your house and 
turn them off if you like them.

Mounting Your (Expensive) Display 
(Carefully!)
One of the biggest advances in TV displays in recent years has been the 
depth of the units — displays are getting thinner and thinner. Instead of just 
plunking your new display on top of a tabletop, consider mounting it on the 
wall or ceiling (such as in the case of projectors).
Mounting a display can be easy if you plan and design well up front. As you 
will read, there’s more than one way to mount a display. You should ask 
yourself some questions about how you intend to use your TV before you 
settle on a particular mounting approach:
 
 Is viewing flexibility an important consideration? If you want to be able 
to see the display from two locations, a swing arm mount is great — you 
can merely swing the display around to face the desired room. You might 
do this, for example, so that you can watch your plasma TV in the family 
room, but then swing it out so that it can be viewed from the kitchen, too. 
It’s great for watching cooking shows!
 
 Where do you want to put the display in the room? Plan for your 
cabling. Are you mounting the display on a brick wall or in front of a 
window? In these instances, a ceiling mount may be better because it 
will be easier to run your cables invisibly.
 
 If you are interested in a better understanding of how to prepare your 
home for all your digital home wiring needs, check out our Smart Homes For 
Dummies (Wiley), which deals with all types of whole-home networking.
 
 Are you planning on mounting your display over a fireplace? It can get 
hot over a fireplace that’s in use, and this heat can damage your display. A 
lot of TVs don’t have a cooling fan — they use convection for cooling and 
have to be 5 inches from the wall. If you are short on space and cooling is 
a concern, look for a TV with a fan. If a lot of heat is coming up from the 
fireplace, you need a mantel to deflect the heat away from your TV.
 
 How do you want to use your display? Will you want to view this some-
times while lying on the floor and other times on the couch? You might 
want a swing mount with a high degree of pitch so that you can change 
the angle as you desire. Do you want to press a button and have the 
display automatically appear? Look for pop-up and ceiling automated 
products for this purpose — often used in places such as apartments in 
the city, where you might have limited space.

313
 Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
 
 If you intend to use a swing mount and have chosen to buy third-party 
(that is, nondisplay-driven) speakers, you will want to make sure you can 
purchase an add-on accessory to mount your center speaker onto the 
display itself, rather than bolting that particular speaker to a wall. Doing 
so ensures that your center speaker swings along with the TV . . . thus 
avoiding that embarrassing situation in which lips move in one place but 
the corresponding dialogue comes from another — yech!
 
 Is this room subject to different lighting during different times of the 
day? Pitch wall mounts — ones that can shift a display up and down — 
are good for rooms that have glare during certain times of the day.
 
 Is this a permanent installation or something you might change as 
newer TV display models come out? Many homes trade up TVs every 
few years and swap TV sets from room to room in a hand-me-down fash-
ion. Automated lift mounts are pretty permanent installations in most 
instances.
 
 How does this have to look? Is decor an issue? If you need this to be 
really flush with the wall with all your cables well hidden, you might 
want to go with a swing arm (as opposed to a static) mount because a 
swing arm allows you to use a recessed area in the wall. You can con-
nect the mount to the wall and then pull out the mount and connect all 
the cables and display. When you are done, you push the mount back 
against the wall and have a fashionable flush installation. You may not 
be able to do this with a static mount because it’s harder to hide all the 
connected cables. Also, you can design your mounting so that you can 
go with artwork that slides over the display or opt for a decorative trim 
to the display. You can even buy a certain material to cover your display 
that acts like a mirror when the display is off but is transparent when 
the display is on. Pretty James Bond if you ask us!
 
 Do you care about specific orientations for your display? With some 
mounts, you can rotate your display to a vertical position. If you are into 
photography, the display can change to portrait mode, for instance, for 
those vertically oriented pictures. Or, you might want to view the dis-
play horizontally but store it vertically, if space is a consideration.
Understanding your mounting options
Three basic types of mounts are available:
 
 Flat-panel mounts: These are designed predominantly for plasma dis-
plays and LCDs. You will find versions for ceiling, wall, and pole mounts 
(for floor-based mounting). Flat-panel mounts can be static, pitch, and 
swing mounts. Static mounts don’t move. Pitch mounts pivot up and 
down. Swing mounts articulate up and down and side-to-side.

314
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
 
 Projector mounts: Projector mounts are generally based around one 
design, but they tend to come with a lot of accessories that let you use 
the mount on a ceiling or wall, deal with a drop ceiling, and so on.
 
 Automated solutions: For super-slick installations, projector ceiling lifts 
and pop-up plasma lifts hide your gear when not in use. You can also 
automate swing arms so that, with the press of a button, your TV swings 
into a preprogrammed position.
 
 If you’re thinking about an automated solution, a different level of exper-
tise is typically required to manage the environmental, electrical, and 
other design elements of a successful implementation. These are gen-
erally not do-it-yourself projects. If you’re looking for help mounting a 
display, we recommend that you check with your home theater dealer, 
look on the mount manufacturer’s Web site, or look for installers in 
the homeowners section on the CEDIA (Custom Electronic Design and 
Installation Association) Web site at www.cedia.ne.
What to look for in a mount
When looking for a mount, consider these attributes of a manufacturer’s 
products:
 
 Design/ease of installation: Look for a mount with a lot of open space in 
its structure so you have a lot of room to do everything else you need to 
do when mounting a display. Check for a wall plate with minimal surface 
area so that you have more flexibility in where your cable and electrical 
outlets are located. There’s nothing worse than finding that your electri-
cal outlet is hidden by a big piece of unnecessary metal. Also, look for 
hands-free wall mount installations. The best designs allow one person 
to install them — for example, Chief Manufacturing’s flat-panel mounts 
(www.chief.com) allow you to pound a nail in the wall and temporar-
ily mount the whole unit on that one nail, leaving your hands free for 
leveling and final bolting. Some swing arms can weigh up to 50 pounds, 
so you’ll want to be able to preinstall the top two lag bolts and then 
slide the mount over those bolts — leaving the remaining bolts easier to 
install. Less-installer-friendly units don’t have such slide-on options — 
all the bolt holes are encircled with metal so you have to screw the bolt 
in while holding the mount to the wall. (As an installer, you make the 
mistake of installing a mount out-of-level only once.)
 
 Ease of use: Ease of adjustment after installation is important. You 
should be able to adjust the tilt of a mount with a push of your fingertip. 
When you move a display, it should stay there without having to tighten 
knobs. Truly, this is the test of a high-quality mount.
 
 Weight capacity: Make sure the mount is rated not only for your display 
but also for any speakers, decorative trim, and other accessories that 
can add weight.

315
 Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
 
 We suggest that you look for mounts that are UL (Underwriters 
Laboratories) listed. These are tested at several times their rated weight 
capacity, so you’re less likely to have a failure should your annoying 
in-law lean up against the mount during your annual holiday party.
 
 Range of motion (tilt, swivel, extension, and so on): Make sure that the 
mount not only fits in your space but also provides the range of motion 
desired when the size of the mounted display is taken into account. We’ve 
seen instances in which someone bought a mount with the expectation of a 
45-degree angle, only to find that, because of the size of the display and the 
limited extension from the wall, the full 45 degrees could not be achieved.
 
 Integrated cable management: You’ll want to hide your cables. Spend 
time understanding how your wiring will be run. This is especially true 
for ceiling mounts in which the cabling may go through the center of 
the pipe. More than one installer has been tripped up trying to thread a 
wide DVI or HDMI connector through a too-thin mount-extension column 
for a projector. If you have to run cables outside your installation, check 
for snap-on covers that help hide the cables.
 
 Be careful of ceiling mounts that have a flange at the top — make sure 
you understand how you will route the cables out of that flange if you 
are, say, mounting this to concrete. There are instances in which cabling 
run through the center of a mount cannot “get out” of the column due to 
the nature of the mounting surface itself.
 
 Quick detach/attach capability: If you ever have to remove your 
display — to change the filters or lamps in a projector, for instance — 
you want a mount designed to maintain all the mechanical settings of 
the mount itself. You don’t want to have to reset and reconfigure your 
gear each time you put it back.
 
 Integrated lateral shift capability: While awfully techie sounding, lateral shift 
is merely the ability to install a mount off center, when taking into account 
the spacing of the studs in your walls. After all, it would be just dumb luck 
if the spacing of the studs happened to perfectly coincide with where you 
wanted to center your display. A high-quality mount will allow you to dis-
place your mount at least 4 inches to the left or right with 16-inch or 24-inch 
centered studs. An installed display should be able to be positioned verti-
cally as well — quality mounts allow for at least 3 inches of vertical shift.
 
 Aesthetics: Look for mounts that look good to you. Check for multiple 
colors to choose from. Low-profile mounts are important, and details 
count, such as covers for lag bolts on the wall.
 
 Quality: While it’s hard to judge quality as an amateur, obvious indica-
tions, such as being UL-approved, are a good sign that a manufacturer 
cares about its quality image.
 
 Don’t go cheap on your mount: A good mount will last you many TV 
displays. Consider the future when making your purchase . . . nickel-and-
diming here will only hurt you later.

Tips for installing your mount
So you have your mount picked out and you’re ready to install. Here are 
some tips to make sure you have as successful an installation as possible:
 
 Choose the right fasteners for the job. Specific types of wood require spe-
cific anchors. We won’t make you writhe through stories of homeowners 
who tried to mount a 50-inch plasma with drywall screws. Most mount-
ing instructions start with the assumption of wood stud installations, but 
most mounts have specialty kits for concrete anchors, drywall anchors, 
metal studs, and so on. Don’t go cheap here; your homeowner’s insurance 
probably has a big deductible, and you don’t want to have to use it. A 
good rule to plan around: Your anchors need to hold five times the weight 
of what you are putting on the mount. Most manufacturers test their prod-
ucts with 
5⁄16-inch lag bolts (some use 
3⁄8-inch) — a 2
1⁄2-inch-long lag bolt is 
generally acknowledged to be acceptable for large mounts. The main goal 
is to hit the center of your stud with the bolt. To be sure you do, drill pilot 
holes to find the width of the stud so you can determine its exact center.
 
 Range of motion/clearance requirements. On most mounts, the display 
is lowered onto the mount. This means you need to have a little more 
clearance above the mount to make sure you can slide the display into 
place. Generally, this ranges from 4 inches to 
1⁄2 an inch of extra space, 
depending on the manufacturer. So if you have a tight space, think about 
this in advance. If you are installing an electric lift for a plasma display 
or LCD, know that these lifts are generally wide open to the elements 
in its hidden state — so if you lift this into an attic that has no moisture 
controls, the plasma will be exposed when not lowered into the house. 
(That’s bad, in case you needed us to tell you that.) Projector lifts, on 
the other hand, tend to be enclosed in a box that has a plenum rating 
(meaning they’re safe for installation in air flow areas — they have spe-
cial fireproof coatings) and can go in a false ceiling.
 
 Properly gauge your wall structure to make sure it can hold the 
weight. Having a top-of-the-line mount secured to a wall studded with 
2-by-2-inch wall studs won’t get you far with a 60-inch display. The 
bigger the display, the more you may need to create a special mounting 
structure to support the mount — and you’ll probably want to call in the 
cavalry (that is, a professional).
 
 Triple-check your measurements (and then ask your spouse to recheck 
them for you). Use the actual screen and mount when taking measure-
ments, and where possible, confirm your measurements by holding the 
equipment in the space itself. Having good lateral and vertical shift will 
help, but that can cover up only the most minor of mistakes.
 
 Consider hiring a professional installer. This is one area you don’t 
want to mess up. There’s no honor in a broken, 42-inch LCD screen, just 
you out a thousand bucks. The more precise the installation needs to 
be, the more likely it is you’ll need to hire a professional to help.

317

Racking up your gear
Most people spend a lot of time figuring out where and how to mount their 
flat-panel or projector TV, but they don’t spend nearly enough time thinking 
about where to put the rest of their gear.
A proper equipment rack will complement your home theater much more 
than a simple shelving system will. You’ve seen equipment racks before — if 
you’ve ever seen a computer room, or high-end home theater, or Mission 
Control, you’ve probably seen a vertical bank of computers and other gear 
housed in an equipment rack. The boom of home entertainment has pre-
sented a growth opportunity for these vendors to enter the consumer space, 
and with that has come racking options for residential use.
Home equipment racks not only store your equipment but also keep it cool 
and manage all the wiring behind it. As the types of gear you put in your 
home theater become more complex, and as new wiring options come on the 
Adding that extra touch
Some available accessories for your mounted 
display can add to its attractiveness in your 
house (that is, if black matte finish doesn’t turn 
you on as much as it does Pat). For instance, 
you can get old-style picture frames that make 
a display look more like a painting on the wall 
than a TV. Some manufacturers (such as 
Panasonic) actually sell framed plasma flat-
panel displays that come out of the box with 
a fancy wooden frame instead of the standard 
plastic and metal.
Many home theater sites carry masking sys-
tems that will hide your screen altogether. For 
instance, BEI Audio/Visual Products (www.
beionline.com) has something called the 
BEI Motorized Artwork System that is designed 
for raising and lowering a framed canvas art-
work to conceal or reveal a plasma display. Just 
tap a button, and the canvas slides away, and 
the NCAA basketball tournament game comes 
on. The system offers more than 300 reproduc-
tions of works by the Great Masters — Monet, 
Manet, Millet . . . you have a broad selection 
of the most popular works of art. (Danny’s 
partial to Caillebotte’s “Nude on a Couch” but is 
pretty sure his wife won’t agree.) You pick from 
a range of more than a dozen classic wooden 
frames to match your decor. A BEI system will 
cost you around $2,500. (Curiously, BEI has 
the option of shipping the unit with bulletproof 
glass. We’ve heard of hating a picture, but that’s 
a little extreme. However, if you really need to 
protect that plasma, this product’s for you!)
Of course, no picture-framed display would be 
complete without digital art. If you have your 
PC connected to the screen (or a TV that has 
support built right in), check out GalleryPlayer 
Media Networks (www.galleryplayer.
com). GalleryPlayer is a digital home gallery 
service that delivers museum-quality art and 
photography to any high-definition display, 
transforming it to a digital canvas. The applica-
tion is free, and you can display hundreds of 
free images, as well as browse premium (for-
pay) services containing individual pictures 
and collections that will turn your screen into 
an art gallery. Images cost less than $1 each, 
so check it out.

market, you’re going to have to access the rear panels of your equipment and 
move wiring around (at least, until intelligent wireless patch functionality is 
invented!).
 
It used to be that you could just stack all your equipment on each other. That 
was fine, until the equipment starting having more energy-hogging processors 
and other components that collectively generate a lot of heat. If you stack 
your gear on top of each other nowadays, you will burn out components, 
particularly if you put a PC in your cabinet. If you stack your equipment and 
you’ve found that you seem to go through DVD players a lot, it’s not because 
the players are bad — they are just susceptible to heat damage. You need to 
space the equipment and you need a cooling strategy for your gear. The right 
rack can solve these problems for you.
 
Any piece of gear that has a built-in fan (such as a PC) or a large number 
of ventilation holes (such as a receiver or a set-top box) is giving you a big 
clue: It gets hot and needs room to breathe. Make sure you don’t stack things 
directly on top of gear like this.
When looking for a rack, get one that
 
 Cools: Don’t buy a racking system without a built-in cooling system. 
Some offer the ability to daisy-chain fans in one system so it can be auto-
matically turned on and off based on temperature.
 
 Powers: Your racking system should have a way to connect to multiple 
output power bars so that all your power cables can be managed nicely. 
The best power bars have slide-on stabilizing clips that make sure your 
power plugs don’t come out of the power bar. Note: These power bars 
typically are not surge protectors — they are power cable management 
devices designed to help you keep all your cables in order. You’ll still 
want to route these to a surge protector at some point. You can buy high-
end, rack-mounted power protection (as we mention in Chapter 21) that 
will make sure your power levels remain constant in your entertainment 
center.
 
 Slides: Unless you have a special situation where you have rear access 
to your rack, say from a side room, changing cables in the back of your 
equipment is complicated. You have to pull equipment forward to recon-
figure jacks, and this can disconnect your other lines at the same time. 
A sliding rack brings the equipment forward, out of your cabinet, so you 
can access the rear panels.
 
 Rotates: An added bonus is if the rack rotates after it’s out of the 
cabinet, so you can maintain your connections. Once you’ve owned a 
rotating rack, you’ll never go back!

319
 Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
When Danny was outfitting his home theater with a rack system, he asked a 
lot of people about racking because the market for residential racking sys-
tems was still new. Most mentioned Middle Atlantic Products, Inc. (www.
middleatlantic.com). Danny got a Middle Atlantic ASR-HD-42 system 
that can hold up to 350 pounds of equipment, has adjustable shelves, and 
rotates 60 degrees. It has ventilated shelves, power and cooling management 
options, and, if you believe Danny’s raves, is the best looking, best-made resi-
dential equipment rack on the market (which Pat believes, but never wants to 
give in so easily to Danny on such things).
Racks can be pricey — you can spend more than $1,000 on a high-end rack-
ing system. But if you go cheap here, you could lose much more than that in 
equipment. This is simply one area to invest in for the long haul.
Soundproofing and Improving Acoustics
No matter how good your system, if you put it in an environment that is not 
geared toward good sound quality, even the best audio system will sound 
horrible. The room’s construction, furnishings, and window and wall treat-
ments have a massive effect on the quality of sound from your home theater.
Many of the rooms chosen for home theaters are substantially less than 
optimal from a sound perspective. Your biggest enemy is vibration. Just about 
everything — the walls, the ductwork, suspended light fixtures, the drop ceil-
ing — can vibrate. When a subwoofer produces its strong low-frequency acous-
tic energy, that sound wave travels through the room, hitting walls and ceiling 
surfaces. It’s absorbed by the walls, which vibrate in reaction to this energy. 
This vibration then is conducted through any solid surface that it’s in contact 
with it, including studs, joists, and flooring. From there, it travels up through 
the framing of the house, and you end up with a shaking house, making a 
special noise of its own. That’s where you need sound planning (pun intended).
You want to try to control two major types of sound distortions:
 
 Intrusive sounds from outside your home theater (and, to be fair, 
sounds from inside the home theater that seep into the house and keep 
Mom and Dad awake until the end of the midnight movie)
 
 Sound reflections and refractions from the audio system itself
If you’re building a new home or renovating, you have the opportunity to 
address this at the architectural level. You essentially want to create a room 
within a room so that you can isolate and control the effect of the sound 
system’s signals on the room itself. Seek to isolate your inside walls, ceilings, 
and floors from the rest of the house as much as possible. The following list 
gives you some ideas on how best to go about this task:

Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
 
 Place studs appropriately, double your drywall, and insulate for sound. 
You want to avoid having the studs of two adjacent walls touching each 
other. By keeping studs from touching, you cut off a primary means for 
sound to travel between the room and the house (in both directions). You 
can also dull vibrations by adding a second layer of drywall.
 
 To further dampen any sounds, apply insulation inside the wall cavity. 
(If this is a concrete basement, consider a vapor barrier as well to keep 
moisture out of your home theater.)
 
 Apply soundproofing between studs and drywall. Consider adding a 
layer of soundproofing material between the studs and drywall. This 
serves not only to suppress sounds going back and forth but also as a 
vibration trap between the drywall and the studs themselves — further 
reducing unintended effects from your sound system. For instance, 
Acoustiblok (www.acoustiblok.com) sells an effective sound barrier 
that comes in rolls like tarpaper.
 
 When applying soundproofing layers, keep it somewhat limp between 
the studs so it can absorb the acoustic energy more efficiently. Also, 
soundproofing materials are usually pretty heavy, so be sure to buy 
some prime steaks and beer before you ask your neighbors to help!
 
 Apply soundproofing to the floor. Think about a floating floor, which is 
a multilayered floor designed to isolate your home theater from the rest 
of the house. The topmost floating layer, for example, might consist of 
tongue-and-groove chipboard bonded to a layer of plasterboard. That in 
turn would be laid on a spongy layer made of some sort of mineral fiber. 
You could then glue the spongy layer to the existing floor or even mount 
the whole thing on its own joists.
 
 Apply a soundproofing system to the finished drywall. Adding spe-
cialized sound control panels to the walls can help control unwanted 
reflected sounds. When placed at your speakers’ first reflection points 
(typically, the sidewall boundaries and rear wall behind the main lis-
tening position), sound treatment panels reduce your reflected sound. 
(This reflected sound could cause a blurring of the sound image and 
lack of intelligibility.) Sound treatments also reduce the overall sound 
volume in the room, enhancing low-level dialogue and environmental 
effects delivered over today’s high-quality audio systems.
 
 A good way to find your speakers’ first reflection point is to sit in your 
listening position and have one of your home theater–loving buddies 
move a mirror along the walls. When a speaker becomes visible in the 
mirror (from your perspective in your comfy theater seating), you’ve 
found the first reflection point.

321
 Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
The cost of the materials for soundproofing a home theater fluctuates, 
depending on what you decide to do. You can spend a few hundred dollars 
or upwards of $35,000. Over time, you’ll probably add at least some of these 
interior sound treatments to deal with the sound in the room.
Remember that your cheapest first line of sound defense is simply secur-
ing everything that is around the room and listening for things that add 
noise. Subwoofers can definitely shake things up; if that problem rears its 
ugly head, get some inexpensive isolation pads for the subwoofer’s feet. 
Projectors can make a ton of noise, too; consider a special mounting for the 
projector that contains its noise, but remember not to block the fan and air-
flow because it puts off a lot of heat, too.
Who you gonna call?
The following companies offer products that 
can be used when soundproofing your walls:
  Kinetics Noise Control (www.kinetics
noise.com): Kinetics Noise Control 
offers a Home Theater Absorption Kit that 
contains special decorative panels. The 
midwall absorptive panels take care of 
sound reverberation, and the triangular 
corner panels are specifically engineered 
to absorb low-frequency bass sound that 
tends to gather in corners. This company 
also makes special spring mounts for sus-
pending your ceiling (so it doesn’t rattle) 
and other special items for dampening 
other sounds in your room.
  Acoustic Sciences (www.acoustic
sciences.com): Acoustic Sciences has 
a neat product called the Acoustical Soffit, 
which is a discreet acoustic treatment that 
runs around the ceiling borders of your room. 
This architectural acoustic component is 
designed to control low-end bass responses 
while also serving as an internal raceway to 
hide wiring, HVAC, and lighting. Neat idea.
  Acoustic Innovations (www.acoustic
innovations.com): When it comes to 
in-room soundproofing treatments, there 
are many different approaches, and often 
your taste in decoration drives your selec-
tion. For instance, Acoustic Innovations has 
solid hardwood frames in mahogany, cherry, 
walnut, and oak stains for its Maestro line 
of panels that can reduce unwanted sound 
reflections.
  Additional resources: Check out other 
offerings from companies such as Auralex 
(www.auralex.com) and Owens 
Corning (www.owenscorning.com).
Our friend Jim Millay decided to make his own 
acoustical treatments. He got some stiff insula-
tion (like you’d put in your house) and wrapped 
it with professional-looking fabric: voila, instant 
inexpensive panels. We can’t really compare 
these with the professionally manufactured 
ones just discussed, but if you are on a budget, 
consider Jim’s approach. Of course, he’ll want 
a contribution for his idea.

Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
 
In Chapter 2, we discuss having a central wiring hub and a media hub for your 
electronics. People often put these all in a place where they can show them off, 
but with that approach comes heat and noise (from cooling fans) that you must 
deal with. If you can put all the power amplifiers outside the room, there is less 
heat and noise to dissipate, which is something to think about in your plan.
Dealing with Home Theater Lighting
Lighting plays a crucial role in setting the right atmosphere for your home 
theater. A bright light in the wrong place or the wrong glare from an open 
window can be just as annoying as someone’s cell phone going off in the 
middle of a show.
Most home theater planners agree that the video on your display looks best 
when the room lights are off (or significantly dimmed), the doors are closed, 
and the shades are drawn. This is where the creative use of dimmers, motor-
ized drapes, window treatments, and a lighting control system can become 
pivotal pieces of your home theater environs.
Wall-mounted dimmer switches allow you to control the intensity of an indi-
vidual light or series of connected lights. In most instances, this is a simple 
and cheap way to change the ambience, and you can do it with $5 and a trip 
to Home Depot.
If you want to have real fun, think about moving to a complete lighting con-
trol system. For as little as $300, you can get a system designed for control-
ling lights in one room (your home theater). From a wall-mounted keypad, 
a remote control, or both, you can turn on/off, brighten, dim, or otherwise 
control each light fixture in the room.
If you choose a sophisticated lighting control system (we talk about a few 
in this section), you can program the system to do some elaborate lighting 
tricks. For example, you might set up a preshow mode that has lights on all 
over the room, maybe accentuating your bar area or couches, if you have 
them. Then you might have a viewing mode that would dim the sconces, cut 
the overhead lights, initially highlight the front of the home theater, and then 
fade, open the curtains in front of your home theater, and start the show. 
(These different lighting modes are known as scenes.) Way cool.
With not too much more effort, you can use remote controls, like the ones 
we talk about in Chapter 15, and integrate your electronics further. So in pre-
show mode, you can control the music, and in viewing mode, you can control 
the projector or display. With a good system, the macros you can set up are 
limitless. (Macros are those stored programs in your remote that let you per-
form multiple commands with a single button push, allowing you to create 
new modes for whatever mood.)

323
 Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
There are new construction and retrofit solutions for lighting control, 
depending on whether you are building from scratch or making a system 
fit your existing space with existing wiring. Systems can communicate via 
wireline signaling (using existing AC power lines) or wirelessly. You can get 
single-room systems from players such as Leviton (www.leviton.com), 
Lightolier Controls (www.lolcontrols.com), LiteTouch (www.litetouch.
com), Lutron (www.lutron.com), PulseWorx (www.pulseworx.com), 
SmartHome (www.smarthome.com), Vantage (www.vantageinc.com), and 
X10 (the company — www.X10.com).
Lutron’s $1,800 Home Theater Package is designed for existing rooms where 
rewiring isn’t practical. This product includes four dimmers, a tabletop 
master control, and an infrared receiver so that users can control lights from 
their favorite universal or learning IR transmitter. Lutron also has a higher-
end system that sports RadioRA, a wireless, whole-home lighting control 
system that uses radio frequency technology instead of AC power lines — 
most lighting systems use the X10 protocol and your home’s power lines — 
for signal communication.
X10
In the not-too-distant past, if you wanted a whole-home lighting system, you 
had to install an expensive package from a brand-name lighting retailer. Now, 
many of these same retailers are adopting new industry approaches that use 
your home wiring and wireless technologies to provide low-cost lighting that 
everyone can afford.
X10 is the granddaddy protocol for controlling (turning on and off and dim-
ming) electrical devices, such as lights and appliances, through your home’s 
electrical lines. It has been around for years, establishing itself to such an 
extent that it is now an open standard — meaning that other companies are 
free to sell devices that use this protocol as well. All standards-compatible 
products display an X10-compatible logo on their packaging or on the prod-
uct itself. When you see this logo, you know that the product works with 
other X10 products regardless of the manufacturer.
As you explore the world of X10, you’ll find a bunch of tools in the X10 tool-
box, but the two that ended up being most applicable to home theaters are 
their wall outlet modules and dimmer switches. X10 modules are devices that 
receive and translate X10 signals to control individual lights, appliances, or 
other electrical devices. An X10 wall module is a small, box-shaped device 
that’s no bigger than the AC plug-in transformers that power many home 
appliances, such as telephones and answering machines.
Setting up an X10 module is easy. The module has a standard electrical plug 
on the back and a place to plug in your lamp or other device on the front or 
bottom. First, turn the device “on” (for example, turn on the light switch), 

324
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
and then the X10 module turns the device off and on and dims as appropri-
ate. X10 dimmer switches replace your normal switch and are likewise con-
trolled via the X10 signals over your electrical lines, or manually by you at 
the switch.
X10 doesn’t require specific network architecture other than your existing 
electrical system to work. X10 sends its control signals from the controller 
over your power lines to every outlet in the house. The controller can have a 
remote control or a PC interface.
The successors to X10
But X10 is old, almost older than Pat and Danny (but not that old). It has had 
its share of problems, and at least three new initiatives — each backed by 
their share of industry powerhouse names — are vying for your previously 
X10-bound, home-automation budget:
 
 INSTEON (www.insteon.net): Backed by the founders of SmartHome.
com (one of our favorite sites), INSTEON is the next generation of X10 — it’s 
an integrated dual-mesh network that combines wireless radio frequency 
(RF) with the home’s existing electrical wiring for communications. (By the 
way, in case your head just spun around, integrated dual mesh means that 
INSTEON can use both RF and powerline signaling at the same time, in an 
integrated way.) Homeowners with existing X10 networks can migrate to an 
INSTEON network without having to discard their X10 devices.
 
 ZigBee (www.zigbee.org): ZigBee uses only RF transmission instead of 
X10’s powerline transmission protocols to create a home wireless net-
work for home automation. We discuss Control4, a whole-home network-
ing company that uses ZigBee, in Chapter 21.
 
 Z-Wave (www.z-wavealliance.org): Z-Wave also focuses just on RF, 
using a mesh network that hops from location to location in your home — 
making it easy to extend the network throughout a large home.
These are all different approaches to the same problem. Each offers similar 
modules: plug-in dimmers, plug-in on/off switches, wire-in dimmers with the 
standard paddle design, wire-in dimmers with a keypad, and so on.
In choosing from among the X10 successors, here are some thoughts:
 
 You’re smart to buy an X10 successor rather than X10 proper. We 
recommend you look at these new technologies over X10 unless you’ve 
already made a commitment to X10.

325
 Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
 
 Be mindful of X10 compatibility. If you have X10 installed, look at 
INSTEON because it’s compatible with X10.
 
 All of these successors work. These represent the next generation of 
home automation and as such provide the best performance for your 
money. However, each of these new approaches has its pros and cons.
 
 All of these successors are mesh. These wireless technologies use some 
form of a mesh network, meaning each device in the network can com-
municate with each other device and retransmit a signal if it can’t con-
firm a signal was received.
 
 All of these successors can be programmed and controlled through 
multiple access points. How multiple are we talking here? How about 
computers, Web browsers, mobile phones, remotes, and wall switches, 
for starters?
 
 The number of supported devices should not matter. Z-Wave’s 
addressing scheme allows for only 256 devices. INSTEON and ZigBee 
have addressing schemes that allow many thousands of devices to 
be added to a network. Some pundits will argue that that matters. We 
would be surprised if you need more than 50 addresses in your home, so 
we think this is not an issue.
 
 Wireless frequencies could be a concern, but it’s too early to tell. 
INSTEON and Z-Wave use the 900 MHz frequency spectrum to transmit 
their wireless signals in the United States; ZigBee primarily uses the 2.4 
GHz frequency spectrum, which is also used by Wi-Fi and other wireless 
technologies. If you have a lot of 802.11-based systems in your house, 
you could conceivably have issues with a ZigBee system. However, 
ZigBee uses all 16 channels in the 2.4 GHz band, and if a channel gets too 
noisy, the network moves to a clear channel, so it was designed to deal 
with this. It’s not enough for us to get too worried about it in our own 
implementations.
In the end, it’s likely to come down to the cost for you to install a particular 
set of capabilities in your home — price each solution and see what works 
best for you. Some of these will likely have a package — like a home theater 
lighting package — that makes it easy to accomplish what you want. Such 
packages are easier to install the first time, and you can expand these as your 
needs change.
 
A great resource for ideas about lighting control systems — and your home 
theater in general — is Electronic House magazine (www.electronichouse.
com). It’s inexpensive, available on newsstands, and has helpful hints about 
how to approach your projects from many angles (including lots of home 
theater–specific articles).

326
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
Controlling Your Home Theater 
Environment Remotely
Many lighting control systems can interface with or drive whole-home auto-
mation capabilities. Although whole-home automation is beyond the scope 
of this book (Dare we say it? Why not? Read our Smart Homes For Dummies 
book for a whole-home approach), you can get whole-room automation with 
many systems.
Many of the better remote controls we discuss in Chapter 15 support home-
automation commands. And some manufacturers offer complementary prod-
ucts that work off the same remotes. For instance, Lutron’s Sivoia QED (www.
lutron.com/sivoia) motorized shade and drapery system is integrated 
with the firm’s GRAFIK Eye, RadioRA, and HomeWorks lighting and home con-
trol systems. Each new control offers Open, Close, Raise, and Lower buttons, 
along with three programmable, preset stop locations for shades or draper-
ies. With this, you can control the dimming of the lights and opening of the 
drapes, just like in a real theater.
Hidden advantages of lighting control systems
Although having a lighting control system for 
your home theater makes sense, expanding it 
to other parts of your home makes even more 
sense. In addition to setting the mood in your 
home theater, a lighting control system
  Saves money on electricity bills: Want to 
turn off all your lights at night and enter 
Sleeping mode? One button can do that, no 
matter the condition (on/off) of the lights at 
that time.
  Adds security: Automatically illuminat-
ing dark halls or that creepy space by the 
garage at night not only adds to peace of 
mind but also reduces the likelihood of 
problems.
  Supports your lifestyle: Whether it’s making 
sure your kids’ lights are out at 9:30 or 
automatically turning on your lights when 
you drive in the garage, a lighting control 
system can help support the way you use 
your home.
If you want to find out more about extending 
your lighting control system to the rest of your 
house, check out Smart Homes For Dummies 
(Wiley), which we also wrote.

 Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
Closing the drapes and shades 
without leaving the couch
Motorized shade/drape kits are simple to install and can add a professional 
touch to your home theater. You can get electronic drapery kits that open 
and close on your command. If you have ever installed a drapery rod, a kit 
is basically the same thing with a motor. For instance, the Makita Motorized 
Drape System (www.smarthome.com) is a self-contained system for your 
home theater drapes. You can get a single drape system or a double drape. 
You screw in the tracks, mount the drapes, and plug it in. You can customize 
the length merely by cutting the tracking. Pretty simple.
You can also get motorized window-treatment hardware from manufacturers 
such as BTX (www.btxinc.com), Hunter Douglas (www.hunterdouglas.com), 
Lutron (www.lutron.com/sivoia), and Somfy (www.somfysystems.com).
 
Check to see whether these systems can link to your home automation system 
as well. Most of these manufacturers have begun to offer INSTEON, ZigBee or 
Z-Wave controllers for their window treatments (we just love saying “window 
treatments,” it makes us feel so sophisticated).
Starry, starry night . . .
Fiber optics can add a neat effect to any home 
theater. Here are some ideas, suggested by 
Acoustic Innovations (www.acoustic
innovations.com):
  Starlight fiber-optic ceilings: To make your 
ceiling look like a nighttime sky, you can 
have fiber-optic ceiling panels applied to 
your existing ceiling. The panels not only 
make your ceiling more fun but also offer 
acoustical correction. However, you might 
find yourself spreading out a blanket on your 
home theater floor to watch the ceiling!
  Infinite starfield panels: What better 
accompaniment to your Pink Floyd Dark 
Side of the Moon midnight laser show than 
an infinite starfield in your home theater? 
These are made of multiple polycarbonate 
mirrors and fiber-optic lighting and create 
an illusion of infinite depth. (Not suggested 
for theater ceilings.)
  Fiber-optic carpeting: This carpet is filled 
with tiny points of light (50 fiber-optic points 
per square foot, to be precise).
  Fiber-optic curtains: These classic, velvety 
curtains can twinkle, too. Très chic.
All illuminators come complete with a remote 
locatable dimmer, speed control for twinkle, 
and an on/off switch. You even get to choose 
between a twinkle or color change wheel. 
Decisions, decisions.

Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
Turning up the heat from the 
comfort of your recliner
Automation isn’t just lights and drapes. You can monitor and control temper-
ature settings as well. Don’t forget that you need to maintain the temperature 
for all those electronic components per manufacturer specs — usually above 
55 degrees Fahrenheit at a minimum. If your theater is located in a part of the 
house where you might have to warm it up or cool it off in advance, consider 
integrating the heating system in your home theater room with your control-
ler system, too.
Again, without getting waist deep in detail, you can get X10-, ZigBee-, Z-Wave-, 
and INSTEON-controlled heating and air conditioning modules that interface 
with your environmental controls to
 
 Make sure they stay within a specified temperature range
 
 Allow you remote control in case you want to prep your theater
Many of the firms mentioned for lighting control systems have similar sys-
tems for heating and air cooling. These systems are usually tack-on modules 
to their other systems and can cost as little as $30 to $50. A decent bidirec-
tional home automation thermostat will probably run you $200. Check out 
www.smarthome.com, www.automatedoutlet.com, and www.X10.com 
for some good options. Again, whole-home options cost considerably more 
because you start getting into multiple zones and probably several interface 
formats. But for your home theater, the ability to preset your environmental 
controls from remote locations won’t cost much.
Getting Comfy
Finally, getting comfortable in your home theater means different things to 
different people. To Danny’s wife, it probably means having about 20 large 
pillows from Pier One Imports lying around the floor. To Pat’s wife, it would 
mean having theater seats wide enough for Opie the beagle to sit next to her 
(with some beagle-proof fabric covering them).
You have many options for home theater seating comfort: chairs, couches, 
and lounges; seating that’s motorized or manual; some with storage and con-
trol compartments; some with speakers built-in; the list goes on.
You’re probably looking at around $300 and up per seat for specialty theater 
seating, and seats can quickly get into the $2,000–$3,000 range if you start 
piling on the extras. You can really sink money into your seats.

329
 Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
Some things to keep in mind, no matter what you buy:
 
 Sound implications: You’ll set up your sound system so that no matter 
where you sit in your theater, you have a similar (breathtaking) aural 
experience. Three couches in a U-shaped configuration may sound right 
for you, but make sure that your speaker configuration is designed to 
handle it. You may need some additional speakers or ones with a differ-
ent capability to support weird configurations. Seating configuration and 
speaker configuration simply go hand-in-hand.
Going Hollywood all the way
For those of you who want to go all the way with 
the theater theme, you can buy all sorts of add-
ons to create that atmosphere:
  Personalized home theater intro: Open 
each showing with your own customized 
one-minute video, just like in the theaters. 
(Your DVD player must be able to play 
DVD-R for this to work.) For $160 or so for a 
customized DVD from www.htmarket.
com, you can personalize one of five home 
theater intros, from an awards night theme 
to a classic popcorn theme. How fun is 
that?!
  Specialty rugs: You can get rugs festooned 
with stars, film reels, popcorn, and so on. 
The cost is about $50 per square yard on 
average (but there’s a huge range). HT 
Market (www.htmarket.com) has these 
rugs.
  Posts and ropes: If you wanted that velour 
rope and stainless steel post look, you’ve 
got it. Expect to spend around $120–$300 a 
post and $80–$100 a rope. Maybe there is 
some poetic justice about making your boss 
wait in line at your home theater! Pat’s going 
to buy a set of these the next time Danny 
is in town. Check out www.stargate
cinema.com if you’re interested in pick-
ing up some posts and ropes for yourself.
  Popcorn machines: Complete with the 
swing down popping bucket, these $300–
$900 machines give you freshly popped 
popcorn and that movie-theater smell. 
Check out www.popcornpopper.com 
for some cool models.
  Wall sconces: You can get theater lighting 
that will give you that interior decorated 
look on a budget (about $200–$250 apiece). 
You don’t need to go anywhere special for 
these — you can hit your local hardware 
store or go to Lowes or Home Depot.
  Film posters: Decorate the outside of your 
theater with current and past movie post-
ers, just like you see while waiting in line to 
get your tickets. These run about $10 to $20 
for current films, in their usual 27-x-40-inch 
formats. Check out www.allposters.
com for new ones or find vintage posters at 
places like www.moviemarket.com.
  Sound Edgelits: Add some of these table-
top back-lit signs to let your viewers know 
which sound systems you have in your the-
ater. These $225 signs sport Dolby Digital, 
THX, DTS, and other surround-sound logos. 
You can find these (and more) at places 
such as www.hometheaterdecor.
com and www.htmarket.com.

330
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
 
 Visual implications: Although high-backed theater chairs may look good 
in the showroom, they can block your rear surround-sound speakers. 
If you want multiple rows, these high-backed seats may necessitate 
a tiered floor (so back-row viewers see the screen, not the back of a 
chair).
 
 Food: The “You can’t take food into the living room” rule doesn’t go over 
well with a viewing population trained to eat popcorn while they watch 
movies. So you need to consider how you will handle food. You may 
want built-in trays or drink holders or nothing. Maybe you need tables 
between chairs instead. All we ask is that you think about how you’ll 
handle food when you’re buying the furniture and rugs. No sense setting 
yourself up for yelling at the kids later.
You need to consider seating more than some other aspects of your home 
theater because many people are used to viewing movies in bed, on couches, 
on the floor, and so on. You really need to think through how you define com-
fortable and then design toward that.
 
Cuddlebags (www.cuddlebag.com, $499–$699) has theater beanbag-style pil-
lows — they’re comfortable, washable, and malleable, too. They come as big 
as 8 feet wide. Wow, that’s a lot of cuddling!

Moving Up to the High End
In This Chapter
 Defining the high end
 Checking out integrated systems
 Doubling your lines
 Getting into scalers and interpolators
O
ne somewhat vaguely defined concept that we talk about throughout 
Home Theater For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is the idea that you can move 
up to the high end when you’re buying components and setting up a home 
theater. Everyone has his or her own definition of high end, but for us it 
means equipment that offers the ultimate reproduction of music and movies.
In this chapter, we quit talking about high end in the abstract and get concrete 
by introducing you to some awesome high-end systems. (Watch out for nose-
bleeds here.) The systems’ designers are so single-minded in their pursuit of 
musical and video fidelity that they’ve created proprietary systems that they 
feel do a better job than standard mix-and-match components. When we say 
a system is proprietary, we mean that it is designed to work best (or in some 
cases only) with other components from the same vendor. So if you buy 
part of your home theater from one of these vendors, you’ll probably end up 
buying all of it from them — at least on the audio side. These systems usually 
work with any display. When you buy a proprietary system, you are in effect 
taking a bet on this company’s ability to do things better than the industry in 
general does — and on the company’s ability to stay in business and support 
you in the future.
Later in this chapter, we also talk about some of the video processing systems 
that let your top-of-the-line display look as good as (or better than) the 
movies you see in the theater.

Par t V: Let ting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
Introducing High-End Home Theater
In the introduction to this chapter, we start to define what we think high-end 
theater is. Our definition of high end starts and ends with the philosophy of 
the designers and engineers who create the product (which can be speak-
ers, a display, an A/V controller or power amplifier, or even an A/V receiver, 
though high-end systems usually consist of matched sets of separate compo-
nents, rather than all-in-one receivers).
Anybody designing a piece of consumer electronics equipment has to bal-
ance a lot of different (and often conflicting) requirements: performance, 
price, size, interoperability with other gear, aesthetics, and so on. High-end 
gear skews this delicate balance toward the performance side of the equa-
tion, and as a result, the high-end components can be much more expensive, 
big, proprietary, and even ugly (although through the right set of eyes, these 
devices are beautiful).
A few years back, there was a bit of a geographic divide (or at least, a perceived 
divide) between high-end and mass-market A/V components. High-end vendors 
were located in the United States, Canada, and Europe, while big consumer 
electronics companies based in Asia were focused on high-volume, middle-
market products. We’re not convinced that this perception was ever correct, 
but we’re sure that it’s not true today. Although many high-end manufactur-
ers are based in the traditional places, you can find some awesome (and 
expensive) gear coming from those big Asian consumer electronics compa-
nies. Just because a company sells a ton of $299 A/V receivers doesn’t mean 
that it can’t build a great $3,000 receiver. So throw any perceptions of brand 
bias out the door because you may be surprised by who has some fine high-
end products these days.
Separating Your Amps
Within the audio realm of the home theater domain, the most common step 
for manufacturers moving up to higher-quality products is to transition from 
the all-in-one A/V receiver into separates. We talk a little about separates in 
Chapter 11, but in this chapter, we get a bit more detailed.
Basically, separate components take the many functions of an A/V receiver 
and divide them among several separate components. Doing this has two 
major benefits: greater flexibility and better performance.
A/V receivers are pretty darned good these days, and there is such a thing 
as a high-end A/V receiver. These receivers (from companies such as Denon, 
Yamaha, and Marantz, to name just a few) compete performance-wise with 
most separates systems in their price range.

333
 Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End 
The functions of an A/V receiver are usually doled out to the following 
components:
 
 A/V controller: This device handles all the surround-sound decoding 
and digital-to-analog conversions. It also switches audio and video (from 
source devices to the amplifiers or display) and performs the preampli-
fier functions (from adjusting the power level of audio signals going to 
the amplifiers, to adjust the listening volume). A few A/V controllers 
include a built-in radio tuner, making them essentially A/V receivers 
without built-in power amplifiers.
 
 Depending on who’s talking, you might hear these devices referred to 
as surround-sound processors, home theater preamps, or something else 
entirely. If it decodes the surround-sound signals and switches between 
audio and video sources, it’s an A/V controller.
 
 Power amplifier: These devices boost the power of analog audio signals 
coming out of the controller to drive the speakers and create sound. 
As we just mentioned, you don’t control volume with the power ampli-
fier (the A/V controller does that). Basically, a power amplifier is a big 
box with an on/off switch, speaker terminals, and one or more RCA jack 
audio inputs on the back for connecting to the A/V controller. Most 
home theater power amplifiers are multichannel amplifiers, meaning 
they have five, seven, or more built-in amplifiers for powering your 
surround-sound speakers. Some systems are designed around mono 
power amplifiers, in which each channel in the system has its own ampli-
fier. (You can also find two- and three-channel amplifiers to mix and 
match into a five- or more channel system.)
 
 Radio tuner: We discuss these in Chapter 5. Just remember that the 
majority of A/V controllers don’t have a built-in tuner, so if you want to 
listen to the radio, you need to buy a separate tuner. If you have digital 
cable or a DSS satellite dish, you might get around this requirement if 
you can receive radio stations through these systems (and if you like the 
channel lineups they offer).
Connecting a separates system is only minimally different from the process 
of hooking up a home theater based on an A/V receiver. Just as you do with 
an A/V receiver, you want to route all your source components through the 
A/V controller. All your analog audio, digital audio, and video connections 
connect directly from the source device to the A/V controller. (The only 
exception to this rule is this: If you don’t have enough of the right kind of 
video inputs on your A/V controller — specifically if your controller doesn’t 
have HDMI switching — you might connect the video cables from some of 
your components directly to the display.)
Your powered (active) subwoofer connects directly to the A/V controller, 
just as it connects to your A/V receiver. The rest of your speakers, however, 
are connected differently. You use an audio interconnect cable (the standard 

334
Par t V: Let ting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
RCA plug cables we discuss in Chapter 16) for each channel of your 5.1-, 
6.1-, or 7.1-channel surround-sound system and route this signal from a set of 
Power Amplifier Out connections on the back of your controller to the appro-
priate Preamp In connections on the back of your power amplifier(s).
Moving to Integrated Systems
One method that many high-end vendors use to create a high-performance 
system is to come up with their own integrated way of doing home theater. 
Some of these systems use proprietary connection systems (their own spe-
cial cables) to link components, whereas others use standard connectors and 
cables but have components that are specially designed to work together.
These systems are basically the steroid-enhanced siblings of the inexpensive 
home-theater-in-a-box systems we discuss in Chapter 2. You buy a complete 
system from a single manufacturer, rather than picking and choosing between 
components from different vendors. It’s a high-end, soup-to-nuts approach; the 
power amplifiers, A/V controllers, DVD and CD players, and speakers — every-
thing but the display itself, in most cases — come as one integrated package 
from one company.
In the sections that follow, we talk about some of the leading integrated sys-
tems. Just keep in mind that these aren’t the only manufacturers who build 
these kinds of systems, just a sampling.
Going modular
As you’ve no doubt noticed while reading this book, the technologies that 
allow us to replicate a movie theater in our homes are not static. Over the last 
decade we’ve moved from VHS tapes to DVD discs and now on to Blu-ray (and 
quite possibly on to downloaded video stored on hard drives). Surround sound 
has gone from Dolby Surround to Dolby Digital and now on to Dolby TrueHD. 
Movie audio has moved from stereo to 5.1 channels and now to 7.1 (and may 
end up reaching 13.1 some day!). The video itself has gone from 480i to 1080p. 
Nothing has stood still.
Your investment in home theater may be significant, and nothing guarantees 
that what you spend good money on today will be capable of handling the 
best of tomorrow’s home theater. If you’re spending thousands and thou-
sands of dollars on a high-end receiver or separates system, this thought may 
bother you more than a little bit.

335
 Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End 
Many manufacturers of high-end gear understand this and developed modular 
systems designed more like PCs than traditional audio gear, with replaceable 
cards (much like the modular cards used in PCs for graphics and networking) 
that can be added or swapped out over time as new developments in home 
theater begin to outstrip the original capabilities of your equipment.
Examples of this include NAD Electronics’ (www.nadelectronics.com) 
T765, T775, and T785 home theater receivers and T715 preamp/processor. 
Each component is built around five separate circuit cards (handling HDMI 
video, component video, digital audio, stereo analog audio, and multichannel 
analog audio). This approach allows a simple circuit card upgrade/replace-
ment when a new standard in one of these areas comes to pass. A number of 
manufacturers have adopted this approach, which probably won’t be cheap 
but will cost less than buying a new component.
Another aspect of this more PC-like approach to home theater components 
is that many components include an Ethernet connection. Through this con-
nection to your home network (and on to the Internet), your component can 
download firmware upgrades — upgrades to the software that controls the 
component’s functionality. In many cases, new features and functions can 
be simply turned on with a firmware update (just as is the case on your PC, 
where operating system updates provide new features).
Meridian’s DSP-based system
Meridian (www.meridian-audio.com) offers some of the coolest, highest-
end A/V equipment anywhere. One Meridian feature that we think reflects 
the future of A/V gear is its computer-like construction. Meridian systems are 
incredibly modular and upgradeable. So if your current Meridian processor, 
for example, doesn’t support a new surround-sound format, you can simply 
have your dealer pop in a new card. By the way, Meridian is the developer of 
MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing), the lossless audio compression technique 
used for Dolby’s TrueHD surround-sound format.
Meridian’s products are known for being some of the finest in terms of dealing 
with digital audio signals (no surprise given Meridian’s expertise in the field). 
Meridian does a couple of things differently than most other A/V component 
vendors:
 
 Smart Link: Meridian has an all-digital connection called Smart Link for 
carrying DVD-audio signals to the controller. In Meridian’s own words 
(and we believe what they’re saying), Smart Link allows “the full reso-
lution of multichannel audio from DVD-A recordings [to] be losslessly 
transferred in the digital domain from player to surround controller to 

336
Par t V: Let ting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
loudspeaker.” That’s a mouthful, but it means that digital audio signals 
remain digital until the very final link in the audio chain — the speakers. 
Meridian can do this because of Smart Link, and also because of the item 
we discuss next.
 
 DSP loudspeakers: Meridian builds active loudspeaker systems designed 
to connect and integrate with its lineup of CD/DVD players and A/V con-
trollers. Like all active speakers, these have built-in power amplifiers, 
so you don’t need a separate amp. The difference comes with the digital 
signal processor (DSP) that gives them their name. This digital signal pro-
cessor allows Meridian to send fully digital audio signals to the speakers. 
So the digital chain is broken only when the speakers themselves convert 
the signal to analog internally. You benefit from a clean, interference-
resistant digital connection. Additionally, the DSP speakers do all the 
things that normal loudspeakers do (such as crossovers that send different 
frequencies to different drivers within the speaker) entirely in the digital 
domain. There’s even a separate amplifier within the DSP speakers for 
each individual driver.
All this modularity, flexibility, and digital audio goodness doesn’t come 
cheap. Meridian’s flagship speakers, the DSP8000, cost $40,000 a pair. They’re 
not for the faint of heart or the shallow-walleted. But the sound is awesome.
We understand that most folks can’t afford (or won’t spend the money on) 
$20,000-a-piece loudspeakers. (We can’t either, to be honest, at least not with-
out second mortgages.) But we’re telling you about this product because these 
kinds of systems give you a feel for what’s possible in home theater. And the 
technologies featured in these systems will eventually, in the words of Ronald 
Reagan, “trickle down” to more affordable gear. We certainly can’t wait for DSP-
based active loudspeakers and modular, upgradeable components to hit the 
Crutchfield catalog instead of super-expensive boutique audio stores.
Exploring High-End Video Systems
Audio isn’t the only part of home theater that fits into the high-end category. 
If you’ve read earlier parts of the book (particularly the discussions of front-
projection display systems in Chapter 14), you already know that high-end 
video systems (such as the $30,000, three-chip DLP projectors we keep 
mentioning) are on the market, waiting to be gobbled up by well-to-do home 
theater enthusiasts. If you want to go high-end with front projection, look for 
units from Faroudja (www.faroudja.com) or Runco (www.runco.com).
In this section, we talk about a group of high-end devices called video pro-
cessors that complement these displays (particularly projection systems) in 
many home theaters.

337
 Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End 
Improving resolution
If you go for a front- or rear-projection system or the biggest plasma display, 
you get a really big picture in a home theater. The problem is, the picture 
is so big that you begin to see the line structure of analog NTSC television 
broadcasts (and other low-resolution sources, such as VHS VCR tapes). These 
sources don’t have sufficient resolution, and you end up with a picture that 
looks okay on a 20-inch TV in the bedroom but like a disaster on your fancy 
projection TV. Simply put, the 250 horizontal lines that make up a VHS picture 
will be so far apart on a big-screen display that you can see them (and the 
black lines between them) without sticking your face up next to the screen. 
This is, to say the least, annoying.
To get around this problem, many high-end projectors (and other displays 
as well) use a device known as a line doubler. A line doubler, in its simplest 
form, takes the two fields that make up a frame in an interlaced video system 
and combines them. (We discuss frames and fields in Chapter 4 if you’re not 
sure what we’re talking about here.) These newly reconstructed frames are 
then sent to the display twice in a row, until the next pair of images comes 
along (1⁄30 of a second after the first). For example, with NTSC broadcast TV 
signals, the 480 interlaced scan lines of the broadcast come out of the line 
doubler (and head in to your display) as 480 progressive-scan lines. This 
makes for a much smoother image and helps hide those visible scan lines 
because twice as many are displayed at a time.
To take advantage of a line doubler, your display must be able to handle 
progressive-scan video. Look for displays with scan rates of 31.5 kHz or 
higher. (We discuss scan rates in Chapter 13.) Most HDTV-ready or progres-
sive scan displays already have an internal line doubler built in. As you start 
moving to really high-end home theater installations, many experts like to 
bypass these by using a top-of-the-line external line doubler (or more likely, 
one of the devices we discuss in the next section).
Investigating top-of-the-line 
video processors
Video processors go beyond simple line doubling. You can find processors 
that quadruple the number of lines on your display, and increasingly you 
can purchase a processor that scales a video source to a specific (and often 
custom) fixed resolution suitable for displays such as plasma, LCD, and DLP, 
which have a specific number of pixels onscreen.

338
Par t V: Let ting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
Going quad
Some video processors do more than just double the lines of resolution. 
For example, line quadruplers (as the name implies) quadruple the number 
of scan lines sent to the display. These systems don’t wait for four fields to 
come in and then repeat them four times (which is what you might think they 
do, given how line doublers work). Instead, line quadruplers do some math 
and interpolate what might come between a pair of lines. (Because there’s no 
actual picture data for the new extra lines, the quadrupler uses various math-
ematical models to guess what might be there.)
For NTSC analog video signals, a quadrupler gives an output of 960 progressive-
scan lines. (In other words, it doubles the 480i output to 480p, and then doubles 
that again to 960p.)
Line quadruplers are rare these days simply because most folks have begun 
using digital displays (such as DLP projectors or plasma flat panels), which 
have fixed resolutions. If you want to enhance the video quality for these 
types of displays, you use one of the scalers we are about to discuss.
Scaling the video heights
The most advanced video processors available (usually called image scalers) 
can convert an incoming video signal to a customized resolution — a resolu-
tion that is most suitable for a particular projector or other display. In other 
words, these particular video processors don’t do a simple doubling or qua-
drupling of a signal. For example, if you were using a 1080p DLP projection 
system, the scaler would convert an incoming video signal to a resolution of 
1920 x 1080 pixels, with progressive scan.
Instead of a scan rate or a number of lines of resolution, fixed-pixel displays 
need a video signal that contains a certain number of horizontal and vertical 
pixels. For example, if you have a DLP-based projection system using Texas 
Instruments HD-2 chip (which has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels), you want 
a scaler that can output a 1280 x 720 video signal.
All fixed-pixel displays have internal scalers that can perform this image scaling. 
Many home theater enthusiasts (at least those who are spending $5,000 or more 
on a display) bypass these internal scalers and use an external image scaler that 
they feel does a better job of interpolating and creating video signals.
Most image scalers also contain circuitry to perform 3:2 pulldown, the process 
of removing artifacts found in video when a 24-frame-per-second video is con-
verted to a 30-frame-per-second video. (We discuss this in detail in Chapter 4.) 
This feature is also found in many DVD players and a number of displays, but 
standalone image scalers often have superior systems for this process.

339
 Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End 
The following models are a couple of the most popular image scalers:
 
 Gefen Home Theater Scaler PLUS: Gefen (www.gefen.com) is widely 
known throughout the home theater community for its high-performance 
video switching and processing solutions. In particular, Gefen is the go-to 
source for folks who need to deal with switching and distribution of HDMI 
sources. The folks at Gefen entered 2008 (and the annual CES trade show) 
with some big announcements, including a $499 video processor called the 
Home Theater Scaler PLUS. For considerably less money than competing 
products, the Scaler PLUS can accept S-video, component, and HDMI con-
nections and scale them to resolutions up to 1080p, as well as switching 
those sources and their corresponding audio.
 
 DVDO iScan VP30: DVDO (a division of Anchor Bay, www.anchorbay
tech.com.com) is one of the original big names in the imager scaler 
business, and its iScan VP30 is a neat unit that can play several roles in 
a home theater. For $1,999, the unit combines a high-quality scaler with 
an HDMI switch — accepting up to four HDMI inputs from different video 
source components in your home theater (a big deal because very few 
TVs have more than two HDMI inputs, and even fewer receivers have 
any HDMI switching — so the VP30 can come in useful if you’re trying 
to connect an HDMI set-top box, a DVD player, and a PS3 all at the same 
time). The VP30 can scale any input resolution up to HDTV resolutions, 
including 1080p, and also offers a Precision AV LipSync function that 
ensures that your digital audio and video always stay synchronized (so 
you don’t end up thinking you’re watching a poorly dubbed Kung Fu 
movie due to audio/video timing issues).
Relating scaled images and HDTV
You may have noticed that some video pro-
cessors can output video at resolutions that 
would qualify as HDTV resolutions (720p or 
higher). So the question may have entered 
your mind, “What’s the relationship between 
scaled images and HDTV?” Well, to begin with, 
a scaled image (no matter how high the resolu-
tion and how good the system that created it) 
is not high definition. After a lower-resolution 
video signal is run through a high-quality scaler, 
the signal can look great — spectacular even. 
But no interpolation system (which is what all 
scalers are, in essence) can put missing infor-
mation back into a video signal. Scalers can 
come close, but they can’t match the real thing. 
Having said that, we hasten to add that scalers 
make great companions to HDTVs and HDTV-
ready displays. For this reason, the majority 
of HDTV displays already have some sort of 
built-in internal scaler, which upconverts lower-
resolution video sources to an HDTV resolu-
tion. External image scalers can often improve 
on these internal systems and make everything 
you watch on your HDTV look better.

Using High-End Controls
One of the most common things folks add to a home theater is a high-end 
control system for providing local and remote control of their audio and 
video masterpiece. You can get a complete system that provides this control, 
and such systems are most often focused on whole-home control.
Crestron
Crestron (www.crestron.com) is a well-known company in the realm of whole-
home automation and control. Crestron doesn’t make DVD players, A/V receiv-
ers, or projection displays, but their products (along with those of a company 
called AMX, www.amx.com, which offers a similar lineup of products) can be 
found in many high-end home theaters. Crestron offers a whole lot more than 
the remote controls we mention in Chapter 15. In a nutshell, Crestron builds 
whole-home control systems that use LCD touchpads to control just about any 
electrically operated device in a home. A Crestron system can raise and lower 
your drapes, dim your lights, adjust your HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning) system, and control all the devices in your home theater. And 
this list is by no means exhaustive. There’s really not much you can’t do with 
a complete Crestron system.
Specifically for home theater, Crestron makes several models of home theater 
control systems that incorporate wired or wireless touchpads and central-
ized controllers (not A/V controllers, despite the name). These touchpads and 
controllers interface with the IR or RS-232 ports on your A/V gear. Crestron’s 
computer-like devices have enough intelligence that you can easily program 
them to perform complex macros (sequences of control actions). So with only 
a single tap of a virtual button, you can set into motion all the things you might 
do manually when turning on your home theater’s systems and getting ready 
to watch a movie.
Crestron sells hundreds of components designed to control a home theater 
(and a home!), and we won’t even try to run through them here. This isn’t 
off-the-shelf, DIY-type stuff. You need to go through a Crestron dealer (many 
high-end home theater installers also install Crestron) to have a system 
designed for, and installed in, your home theater. All this automated good-
ness doesn’t come cheap. The typical Crestron installation is more than 
$50,000, and that doesn’t count the home theater components themselves.

341
 Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End 
Control4
A new competitor to Crestron, Control4 (www.control4.com) has made a 
big splash over the past few years with a range of components that do a lot of 
the same things that Crestron’s systems do but at a significantly lower price.
Control4 offers products that fill all sorts of roles in an automated home, 
ranging from controllers that can dim your lights and adjust your heating or 
air conditioning to touchpad systems that let you send commands to your 
home theater gear. Control4 even offers audio distribution systems that can 
store digital audio and send it wirelessly throughout the home.
Control4 keeps the price down by leveraging standardized components and 
technologies such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi wireless networking (and their gear 
is significantly cheaper than Crestron’s). So Control4 gear doesn’t contain a 
bunch of custom-built electronics, but instead uses some of the same compo-
nents as PCs — stuff that is built in the tens or hundreds of millions for very 
low prices.
Among the most interesting parts of the Control4 lineup (from a home theater 
perspective) are the audio distribution systems. The Media Controller ($1,495) 
contains an 80GB hard drive for storing digital music, a CD player for importing 
new music, and Ethernet and Wi-Fi outputs for distributing the music around 
your home. You can mix this with the company’s $1,995 touch-screen controller 
and use its big 10.5-inch LCD screen to control your music or anything else in 
the home connected to one of Control4’s systems.

epending on where you put your home theater, you can envision adding 
all sorts of extras to flesh out your home operation. But in our minds, 
some things you just gotta have — well, stuff you might really want to have if 
you’re going for the ultimate home theater. We list a lot of them here so that you 
have a checklist next time you’re online or at that home theater store.
Wireless Headphones
Ever want to use the home theater when your spouse, significant other, or 
roommate is asleep, working, or performing brain surgery in the other room? 
Ever get told to “Turn it down!” in no uncertain terms? Well, maybe you need 
that marriage- or friendship-saving device, the wireless headphone.

346
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
You can find some cool models of headphones out there. Some cancel out 
ambient noise (so the kids can scream and smash things, and you won’t hear 
a thing), others use special digital signal processing to recreate 5.1-channel 
Dolby Digital surround sound. Some fit in your ear canals, and some totally 
cover your ear with a huge “can.” Whatever you like, you can find it in the 
headphone world.
We love wireless headphones because they enable us to get more popcorn or 
let the dog out without catching a long cord on something. So wireless head-
sets, which use radio waves to connect to a base station plugged in to the 
home theater receiver (like a cordless phone uses radio waves to connect to 
the phone base station plugged in to a phone jack), are the way to go for us.
 
For serious listening (what the high-end audio types call critical listening), you 
might not want to use cordless headphones, which probably don’t have quite 
the ultimate fidelity of corded models. But for more casual use, we find that 
many cordless models sound great.
One of the more interesting wireless headsets we’ve seen comes from 
Sennheiser (www.sennheiserusa.com). The RS 130 wireless headphone, 
which has a list price of $179.95 (and can be found for about $20 cheaper in 
many places), is a good entry point into the world of wireless headsets. It 
even includes a switchable SRS surround-sound function so you can simulate 
the surround-sound effects of your home theater’s speakers with just the two 
speakers built into the phones. (See Chapter 12 for more about headphones 
and surround sound.)
 
Dolby has a capability called Dolby Headphone (www.dolby.com/dolby
headphone) that can take up to five channels of audio from any source, feed 
it to your normal two-channel headphones, and make it sound like it’s coming 
from that many speakers in a real listening room. The difference relative to 
stereo headphones is amazing. Look for the Dolby Headphone logo on your 
receiver. If your receiver has Dolby Headphone capabilities, you don’t need 
special surround-sound headphones. Any old headphones will give you 
excellent surround-sound effects.
Power Conditioner
Close your eyes and think about your electrical power lines. No, really. Imagine 
a current flowing (or alternating) from Homer Simpson’s nuclear power plant, 
over the high-voltage lines of Springfield, across hill and dale, and finally 
ending up in a transformer on a pole outside your home. Think about all the 
other junk attached to that electrical power grid. Even within your home, tons 
of electrical devices are connected to your power lines. All this stuff adds its 
own little bit of degradation to the nice, clean, sine-wavy alternating current 

347
 Chapter 22: Ten or So Accessories for Your Home Theater
coming out of those turbogenerators at the power plant. End result: power at 
your home theater’s outlets may be of an incorrect voltage or full of electrical 
noise that keeps all your A/V components from being their best.
At a bare minimum, you need (absolutely need) some surge protection in 
your home theater. But even with surge protection, you still may have issues. 
For example, if your voltage drops (not an uncommon occurrence), it may 
lower the output of your amplifier. You can also run into ground issues that 
can either cause hums in your audio or create annoying lines in your video 
display. So you might want to consider investing in a power conditioner that 
improves and stabilizes your AC power. For example, Monster Cable’s Home 
Theater Power Centers provides surge protection, voltage stabilization, and 
noise filtering. The more expensive ones even have a digital voltmeter read-
out on the front. Check them out at www.monstercable.com/power.
Shake It Up, Baby (with Transducers)!
If you’re like us (and we feel that you are if you’ve read most of this book), 
you like to get totally into what you’re watching. After all, a home theater is 
supposed to help suspend disbelief. You can get one giant, T. Rex–step closer 
to that goal with audio transducers from companies such as Clark Synthesis 
(www.clarksynthesis.com). You’ll see these called many things — bass 
shakers, tactile transducers, or as one vendor calls them, butt kickers. They 
add an element that goes well beyond the sensation of a subwoofer, one that 
helps change your whole theater into a sensaround environment. (Remember 
Earthquake in the theaters?) The units are screwed onto the bottom of your 
furniture or into the frames of your floorboards. Transducers operate a bit like 
a subwoofer — vibrating in time with low-frequency sounds — but instead of 
moving air (and therefore creating sounds), they transmit vibrations into solid 
objects (such as the floor) for bass that you can feel as well as hear.
 
These transducers are friendlier to the rest of the house than cranking up 
massive subwoofers that can seem to shake the neighborhood. Because the 
low end of the sound is effectively isolated to a more specific area, namely the 
couch or chairs, transducers virtually eliminate any bleeding of this sound 
into adjoining rooms or connected housing units.
Transducers are also great for houses built on concrete slabs. Unlike wood 
subfloors, concrete slabs don’t conduct bass particularly well.
The sky is the limit with transducers. You can get low-budget ones (such 
as Aura Bass Shakers for under $100, www.aurasound.com) that do a 
fairly good job. If you want more power and precision, check out the Clark 
Synthesis models, which can run from $100 to $300 depending on the model 
(www.clarksynthesis.com/), or the Buttkicker from The Guitammer 

348
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
Company, Inc. (www.guitammer.com, starting at $299). The difference is 
astounding and noticeable. One thing to note: Some products support frequen-
cies up to 200 Hz, and some go even higher (up to 800 Hz). We prefer keeping 
it low, say between 5 Hz and 200 Hz; otherwise, there is a constant background 
rumble that gets nauseating after a while. Keep the effect directed and precise — 
you’ll like it better. To control the frequency sent to your transducer, consider 
an equalizer such as AudioSource EQ200 (www.rodinaudio.com/audio
Source/electronics.php), which runs about $120.
Consider using more than one; try, say, three across the bottom of your couch. 
The middle transducer would acquire its signal from the LFE/subwoofer out 
of the processor-receiver, and the two side ones would derive their signals 
from the left and right front channels, respectively. With this setup, you can get 
a better sense of the action in three dimensions. If you are watching U571, for 
instance, when a depth charge goes off to the right of the submarine, you get a 
sensation from the right channel, and when the lower part of the compression 
from the bomb and water splash enters into the soundtrack, you feel the sub 
channel and right channel together.
 
If you mount transducers directly to your furniture, you can get rubberized 
molded mounts for your chair or couch legs that isolate the noise and vibration 
to your furniture.
 
If you install more than one of these transducers, you probably would do well 
to power each unit with its own amp. Read the manufacturer’s recommendations 
closely. For some of the cheaper models, powering them with anything over a 
20-watt amplifier is probably not a good idea. Some of the fancier models call for 
an amplifier of at least 100 watts. You can find transducers that come bundled 
with an amplifier (active transducers); consider getting one of these if you have 
questions. In any case, the amp should have its own volume control so that you 
can tune the effect relative to the audio level. The hi-fi quality of the amp is not 
critical, so you can use relatively inexpensive amplifiers.
You can get shaker units that attach to the floorboards of your house and 
can shake the whole room. There are pros and cons to this. On the pro side, 
you don’t have to worry about being on a particular piece of furniture to get 
the effect. On the other hand, you are shaking the foundation of your house 
(never really a good thing), and the vibrations can bleed into other areas 
of your house. So before you experiment with your foundation, think about 
which surrounding rooms will be affected.
Motion Simulators
If moving with a movie is your thing, and you have a fairly open budget, 
check out the motion simulators from D-BOX (www.d-box.com). Unlike 
bass shakers, which provide only vibration, or shaking, in response to the 

349
 Chapter 22: Ten or So Accessories for Your Home Theater
audio track and are merely transducers that vibrate rather than move air, the 
D-BOX system is a sophisticated motion-simulation system that lifts seating 
and occupants on an X-Y-Z axis (pitch, roll, and yaw) at up to 2Gs (think F-14 
at full throttle) of acceleration.
D-BOX provides dramatic motion that is precisely synchronized with onscreen 
action, which draws in viewers even more by allowing them to accurately 
experience the accelerations, turns, and jumps that they could previously only 
imagine. When a car rounds a corner in a 007 chase scene, turn with it. If the 
Top Gun jet fighter suddenly moves into a climb, climb with it.
Just about everyone who’s tried this system loves it, but the price tag will set 
you back. An entry-level system runs $15,000 and up.
The D-BOX system consists of two parts:
 
 The controller itself: D-BOX sells three controllers, two models which 
integrate into a PC located in your home theater and a third standalone 
controller (for folks without a home theater PC). This device connects 
to your home network (via an Ethernet port), downloads and stores the 
motion codes that correspond with a particular movie title, and sends 
those codes as motion controls.
 
 The motion device (actuator): The actuators are pistons and motors 
built into D-BOX’s home theater seating devices (there are also seats 
specifically built for gaming). The actuators receive motion commands 
from the controller and turn those commands into actual motion.
 
The experience is possible thanks to a D-BOX DVD or Blu-ray disc with con-
troller codes that map motion to movies. You can see a listing of supported 
movies at www.d-box.com/en/codes/index.html. Movies not on this 
list don’t have the controller codes and therefore cannot provide the motion 
simulation experience.
Turn It Up! Turn It Down! 
Turn It Up Again! Argh!
Sometimes, you just want everything at a quiet but intelligible level (like 
when everyone else is sleeping). To help you in this endeavor, many A/V 
receivers (and some TVs) have a compression circuit built into the digital 
signal processor that keeps the louds from being too loud and the quiets 
from being too quiet (this is often called night mode).

350
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
If you’re using older equipment that doesn’t have this feature, you need a 
leveler (also called a levelizer or a stabilizer). This device automatically adjusts 
your volume to a reasonable level (even as the source material gets louder or 
quieter). If the source volume increases, the leveler attenuates the signal down; 
if the source signal decreases, it adjusts the signal up.
To use a leveler, you generally adjust the volume to where you want it, 
and the leveler keeps the volume at that level. An audio leveler connects 
between any line-level stereo or mono audio source and an amplifier (with 
RCA output/input jacks) or between your TV or VCR outputs and the inputs 
to your stereo tuner. Levelers range in price from $70 to $300 (you can check 
out various units at www.smarthome.com).
No more having to constantly juggle that remote (at least not for changing 
the volume). Keep in mind, however, that these devices are really not for 
serious movie watching, when you want to have all the loud parts loud and 
the quiet parts quiet. They are instead intended for nighttime viewing, when 
you don’t want to wake up the family and still want to hear the quiet parts.
 
Be sure to check the types of audio input/output jacks supported by the 
system you buy. You don’t want to have digital audio connections everywhere 
in your system and then buy an audio leveler that takes it down to a lower 
common denominator with analog connections.
Docking Your iPod in the Wall
The iPod. We suspect that you know the iPod, probably have an iPod and — 
more importantly — probably love your iPod. Are you aware that you can 
easily integrate your iPod into your home theater as an audio source device? 
Back in Chapter 11 we talked about home theater receivers with iPod dock 
options (a number of manufacturers offer such an option these days).
Another way to get your iPod into your home theater (and indeed, into your 
whole-home audio system, should your build one to accompany your home 
theater) is to consider an in-wall iPod docking system.
A few manufacturers build these systems, which are exactly what the name 
implies: a small alcove built right into your wall that sends audio (and video) 
from your iPod while simultaneously charging it! (They’re easy to install — 
just slightly larger than a standard light switch.)
The leader in this market is iPort (www.iportmusic.com). It offers five 
models of its iPort IW (in-wall) docks. To install an iPort, you need two 
CAT-5e cables between your home theater receiver and the iPort dock itself 
(one handles audio and video, the other brings power and control signals to 

351
 Chapter 22: Ten or So Accessories for Your Home Theater
the iPod). At the other end (behind your receiver) you install an iPort Audio 
or Video Wallplate, which connects to an electrical outlet and provides audio 
(and video, in the case of the Video Wallplate) jacks that can be plugged in to 
the back of your home theater receiver.
iPort also makes freestanding iPod docks (the FS series), if you don’t want 
to get as fancy as an in-wall dock. Either way, they make getting an iPod into 
your home theater as easy as can be.
Putting Your Face on the TV
For more than 40 years — since AT&T (then Bell Telephone) demonstrated 
the first “Picture Phone” at the 1964 New York World’s Fair — the telecom-
munications industry has been trying to get people to videoconference. 
Whether it’s shyness from being seen on a screen to a discomfort with the 
quality of the picture, videoconferencing has been limited to select business 
populations — the mass consumer market has not caught on.
But recently, with the boom in Web cams and camcorders that connect 
to PCs, as well as newfangled cell phones that can stream video from an 
onboard camera, people are finally coming around to sending live video of 
themselves.
Adding videoconferencing to your TV set so the kids can conference with 
Grandma and Grandpa is easier than ever before. Companies such as D-Link 
(www.dlink.com) have launched products designed for adding videoconfer-
encing to your TV set. D-Link has its DVC-1000 i2eye VideoPhone ($159), which 
is designed to allow videoconferencing without an intermediary computer. You 
just plug one cord of the DVC-1000 in to a standard telephone, plug another 
cord in to a television via RCA composite connections, connect the DVC-1000 
to your broadband Internet connection using a standard Ethernet network 
cable, and you are ready to conduct real-time videoconferencing.
 
You can’t use a telephone plugged in to the i2eye VideoPhone to place regular 
phone calls because the phone would not be connected to a standard phone 
line. Only VideoPhone calls over the Internet can be made with a telephone 
connected to the DVC-1000.
The DVC-1000 can send and receive video at up to 30 frames per second. The 
remote control that comes with the DVC-1000 allows you to easily answer an 
incoming videophone call or initiate a new one. Or, you can use the attached 
telephone to initiate calls if you are more comfortable with that interface.
The DVC-1000 has a port for an external microphone, too, if you’d rather talk 
into a headset or a mic.

352
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
D-Link also sells the DVC-2000 ($350), which includes a built-in 5-inch color 
LCD screen, in case you don’t want to use the TV display as your screen.
Putting Fine Art on Your HDTV
What do you do with that HDTV when you’re not watching TV? How about 
putting some fine art on the screen? With GalleryPlayer (www.gallery
player.com), you can do just that. Gallery Player is an Internet-based 
subscription service that you can get onto your HDTV in one of two ways:
 
 You can buy an HDTV with GalleryPlayer built in. Panasonic, Mitsubishi, 
and Samsung sell HDTVs that include the ability to display GalleryPlayer 
content on the TV. Just download your favorite galleries to your PC, 
transfer them to an SD card or a USB memory stick, and you’re all set.
 
 You can use a PC. If you have a home theater PC hooked up to your HDTV 
and home theater, you can subscribe to GalleryPlayer via the Internet-
connected PC. This works only with Windows computers using Windows 
XP, XP Media Center Edition, or Windows Vista operating systems.
GalleryPlayer content ranges in price depending on what you’re buying and 
how much of it you’re buying, but typically images run about $0.99 each or 
$9.99 for a complete gallery.
Traditional fine art is available, as well as nature photography, action and sports 
photography, museum collections, content from National Geographic, history, 
geographic explorations, and even nudes. If it’s art, it’s probably covered.
 
It’s not made any more, but if you can find Roku’s HD Media Player on eBay, 
you’ll have a cool digital media player that can play high-definition photos on 
your HDTV. The Roku HD Gallery Collection includes a lot of art that’s similar 
to what’s offered by Gallery Player.
Improving Your Game 
Console Connection
If you read Chapter 16, you had a chance to check out our discussion of 
interconnect cables — the short-run cables that hook together A/V com-
ponents. We hope we convinced you of the importance of the hierarchy of 
these cables and of using the best cable you can in all situations. (In the 
video world, component is best, S-video is a close second, composite video 

353
 Chapter 22: Ten or So Accessories for Your Home Theater
lags way behind, and RF coax connections are on the bench trying to get the 
coach to let them in the game.)
When it comes to game consoles, however, we do find that many people just 
use whatever cable came in the box. As Jeremy Piven says in that movie mas-
terpiece PCU, “Don’t be that guy.” (If you missed PCU, the whole line is: “You’re 
wearing the shirt of the band you’re going to see? Don’t be that guy.”) Most 
gaming consoles come with a lowest-common-denominator video and audio 
cable. For example, Nintendo’s Wii comes with a cable system that only has 
composite video (the component video cable is optional); some versions of the 
Xbox 360 come with a component video cable (HDMI is optional). We recom-
mend making the upgrade to the highest-quality video connection you can use 
with your video console — component video with the Wii, HDMI with the Xbox 
360 or PS3. Get the best gaming video you can get by upgrading the cable!
Turning Down the Lights Automatically
An excellent way to improve your picture is to minimize the light that comes 
from anywhere but your video screen — in other words, to minimize the 
ambient lighting by turning off light bulbs and closing drapes. You could get 
up to turn off the lights and pull down the shades. A little exercise never hurt 
anyone. But how cool would it be to press a button and have the lights dim, 
the motorized drapes lower, and the A/V system power up?
Sound kinda like The Jetsons? It’s not. Home automation isn’t rocket science. For 
just a few hundred dollars, you can put together a simple X-10 system that dims 
the lights (theater-style, even) and activates the drape motors. You can find lots 
of packages at www.smarthome.com. Automation systems are also a task that 
a good dealer can help with. The superstore isn’t going to do this for you, but a 
good home theater dealer/installer should also do automation packages.
This is too big a topic to cover in one section of one chapter. Home automa-
tion is a cool addition to your whole home. We like this stuff so much, we 
wrote a book about it (Smart Homes For Dummies); you can find out how all 
this automation stuff works there.
Stick This on Your DVD!
If you have a personal video recorder in your home theater — or you have a 
lot of MP3s, digital photos, or home videos — chances are you’re going to burn 
these to CD or DVD at some point — possibly for Mom and Dad for their birth-
days. That’s great — burning CDs and DVDs is something that’s easy to do.

354
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
But after you’ve crafted a movie from all your camcorder footage and pains-
takingly matched it to your favorite musical score — and managed to get it 
onto a DVD for playing on any DVD player on the planet — there’s something 
sinful about taking a marker and scribbling on the disc.
Well, lucky for you, a few companies have put together easy-to-use labeling 
kits that help you design and print self-adhesive labels that stick to your 
DVDs and CDs. (So next time you’re in a bar, you can tell that good-looking 
person next to you, “I own my own CD label.”)
Check out products from Fellowes and Avery — both come with software to 
help you create the label images. The kits also contain paper that you stick in 
your laser or inkjet printer. Figure on spending $15–$30 for a kit that comes 
with about 100 sheets of label sticker blanks. You can also buy spine labels 
and blank plastic packaging for an impressive custom DVD package.
For a few more bucks, consider upgrading to a printer that can print directly 
onto the discs themselves. Epson (www.epson.com), Canon (www.canon.
com), and others make inkjet printers that let you feed “printable” DVDs and 
CDs (like TDK’s PrintOn blank discs) right into the printer itself. We think this 
is the best-looking labeling system for the discs themselves — though you 
may still want some other labeling product described earlier for your CD/
DVD storage cases, booklets, and the like.
 
Coming soon to a set-top box near you may be the ability to burn a disc and 
print a silkscreen-quality label on the disc, all inside the set-top box. That’s 
right, set-top boxes from your cable, satellite, and telephone providers soon 
will be outfitted with the ability to not only burn a movie or other content to 
a DVD but also to print that movie’s label by using HP’s LightScribe technol-
ogy (already available on some PCs). So you can not only order a movie on 
demand whenever you want, but also buy the movie, burn it to a DVD, and 
then print the label on the disc — without having to go to a video store. Now 
that’s useful — and legal, because when you “buy” the movie, you are buying 
the rights to create a DVD copy of the movie.
 
If you’re using a PC to burn DVDs for your home theater, you may already 
have a LightScribe-capable DVD burner. Check out the LightScribe site at 
www.lightscribe.com for more information.
Disc-O!
Although they’re not as sexy as fish on your TV or tush-rattling transducers, 
some disc accessories you simply must have in your high-def cabinet.
First and foremost are disc cleaning and repair kits. You can find these for $10 
at Radio Shack, Crutchfield.com, or just about any electronics store. These kits 

355
 Chapter 22: Ten or So Accessories for Your Home Theater
include a disc-spinning device and a solution to polish the plastic CD/DVD to 
get rid of scratches (we hate those), smudges, and other generally unwelcomed 
surface anomalies on your discs. Just pop your disc into the unit, give it a spin, 
and voilà! — clean disc. SmartHome.com sells a nice battery-powered unit for 
around $40.
 
There are disc cleaning kits and disc repair kits — cleaning kits do not neces-
sarily repair scratches. Be sure you get a cleaning and repair kit in one.
You may also want to get a lens cleaner kit, which will clean your DVD/CD 
player’s laser eye to make sure your discs are read as clearly as possible. 
Again, this is as easy as sticking the cleaning disc into your DVD or CD player 
and “playing” the disc. These also are inexpensive — around $15.
An optical head should not need cleaning very often, unless your room is 
really dusty. (In which case, you should get an air filter!) Often, merely blow-
ing your lens area with canned compressed air is the easiest and safest way 
to deal with such problems. You can get compressed air at any office or com-
puter supply store. However, many people like the simplicity of using a lens 
cleaner kit.
 
Do not attempt to use a lens cleaner kit designed for CD/DVD players on your 
notebook or laptop computer DVD drives. The locked spindle in most com-
puter drives would cause the brush to push against the optical head with too 
much force. That could knock the head off its alignment track, damaging the 
drive permanently.
Finally, believe it or not, there are special cleaning solutions for your expen-
sive displays, too. The problem with using regular window cleaning spray is 
that it will run down the screen and get into your display — that’s not good 
because these displays don’t like moisture. And even if you are smart enough 
to spray the rag and not the display before swiping, regular window spray 
can streak, and regular paper towels and rags can also scratch your screen.
 
Some displays have special antireflective coatings that can be damaged by 
cleaners that contain ammonia, alcohol, or some other substances. Read the 
manual for your display before you try cleaning it!
So leave it to the folks at high-end accessories maker Monster Cable (www.
monstercable.com) to come up with the Monster ScreenClean product ($20). 
There’s no dripping — Monster ScreenClean’s drip-free cleaning solution stays 
where you spray it until you wipe it off. It cleans without leaving annoying 
streaks, and the kit sports a scratch-free microfiber cloth that polishes screens 
with crystal clarity and color. You can use this for your camera lenses and other 
glass-outfitted gear, too.
So spend the few extra dollars to really take care of all your expensive gear.

So we’re leaving a few nuggets for other publications to cover. It’s 
only fair.
Here’s a listing of the publications that we read regularly (and therefore rec-
ommend unabashedly) and that you should get your hands on as part of your 
home theater project. Most publications allow you to purchase back issues of 
their magazines, so you can have a library at your fingertips in about a week. 
You know what they say: You can never be too rich or read too much about 
home theater before you become too poor.
Because this is the 21st century, we include some virtual items in our home 
theater library — Web sites, in other words. Keep in mind that the Web sites 
we mention here have a ton of information online, but you might have to try 
different search keywords to find exactly what you’re looking for. Topics vary 
substantially from site to site. All sites are free unless otherwise noted.
Home Theater Magazine
Phone: 800-264-9872 or 850-682-7644
Web site: www.hometheatermag.com
Home Theater Magazine is one of the main sources for information about

instance, because every issue has something to offer, no matter what budget 
constraints you’re dealing with. And you can always find out about the lead-
ing trends in the industry, which is important because there’s nothing like 
buying yesterday’s technology on sale and thinking you got a great deal. 
(How about that sale on Betamax VCRs, huh?) The accompanying Web site 
offers archives of prior articles. An annual subscription costs $12.97 for 12 
issues — quite a deal. For the same price, you can also subscribe to a digital 
edition of the magazine for reading on your PC or Mac.
The same folks also publish a dynamite Home Theater Buyer’s Guide Annual 
Directory, which lists more than 5,000 source devices, controllers, speakers, 
home-theater-in-a-box packages, video displays, and all sorts of accessories. 
The buyer’s guide is divided into three sections — audio component prod-
ucts, video component products, and speaker products — for $3.95 a section

A long-time home theater enthusiasts’ favorite, The Perfect Vision morphed 
in January 2008 from a paper-based subscription magazine to a free online 
publication called Playback Magazine. Playback has great reviews and how-to 
articles (just as The Perfect Vision did), but it adds a whole lot of reviews on 
the stuff that feeds your home theater — namely, music and movie reviews.
Playback uses an extremely user-friendly online format that makes it easy to 
skip between articles, search each edition, and even download, print, and 
share articles. If you’re willing to give up your e-mail address, you can have

 Chapter 23: Ten Great Sources for More Information
We think that, after you start reading this magazine, you’ll want to expand 
your interests beyond home theater to the whole home at large. (Then you’ll 
want to buy our Smart Homes For Dummies book, too!) A one-year subscrip-
tion to Electronic House is $19.95.
Crutchfield
Phone: 800-955-9009 or 434-817-1000
Web site: www.crutchfield.com
This is the perennial catalog that sits by the toilet for constant perusing while 
in the, er, office. Crutchfield offers a free catalog of all sorts of A/V and home 
theater gear, and it’s great for just getting ideas about what’s out there. Its 
companion Web site is laid out very simply and offers a Home Theater and 
A/V Info Center. For instance, you can find some great photos of the various 
connectors at www.crutchfield.com/S-UcwlNAzImN9/learningcenter/
home/connections_gallery.html. (This URL might change, so look 
around for its Home A/V Connections Photo Gallery if you can’t find it.) 
Overall, we pick up our Crutchfield when we want to know, “Does anybody 
have something that will . . .”
CNET.com
Web site: www.cnet.com
CNET.com is a simple-to-use, free Web site where you can do apples-to-
apples comparisons of home theater and electronic equipment. You can 
count on seeing pictures of what you are buying, videos of an editor playing 
with it, editor ratings of the equipment, user ratings of the gear, reviews of 
most devices, and a listing of the places on the Web where you can buy it 
all — including pricing from multiple online stores. It’s a one-stop resource 
for evaluating your future home electronics purchases. We especially like 
the ability to compare different devices side-by-side, so we can see who has 
which features. Overall, a solid stop on your Web research trip.
Home Theater Forum
Web site: www.hometheaterforum.com
Home Theater Forum is a massive, Internet messaging site where people 
interested in home theater gather to discuss their issues and solutions. You 

362
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
can find areas for discussion of home theater basics, construction, DIY solu-
tions, sources, displays, and so on. You really should check it out, if for no 
other reason than to see that lots of other people just like you are also trying 
to figure out what’s going on in home theater.
The HT Construction, Interiors, and Automation forum is a great place to find 
issues that DIYers have had with putting in their home theaters, and tips and 
tricks for avoiding problems. When we last checked, there was a great thread 
about how to find old theater seats that you could renovate and put in your 
home theater. Fun!
AV Science
Web site: www.avsforum.com
Similar to Home Theater Forum, AV Science (or AVS) Forum is an online com-
munity of technical enthusiasts who wallow in the minutest details of a home 
theater installation. But think of it this way: It’s a collection of the-guy-next-
door-who-knows-how-to-install-A/V-gear’s pearls of wisdom — a proverbial 
hothouse of information and opinions to help solve your problems.
The site is organized in folders according to interests. If you want information 
on how to fine-tune your TiVo, for instance, you’ll find a whole group devoted 
to that. There are also places where people are selling their old gear. As the 
techies buy the latest gear, they sell their leading-edge stuff from a few years 
back — at great prices. The manufacturers themselves monitor this site for 
feedback from customers about what they want in their next versions. It has 
that much to offer.
 
If you’re considering buying a specific piece of gear for your home theater, 
check the appropriate forum folder and see if there’s an owner’s thread. We 
find that these discussions (where folks who actually have that equipment 
discuss their experiences and the issues they’ve encountered) are the best 
part of AVS Forum. For example, when Pat was considering buying his Vizio 
P50HDM plasma TV, he spent a ton of time on this forum and was able to find 
out about some issues with the initial versions of this TV and was also able to 
figure out that the unit he was buying had already had the “fix” performed as a 
running change on the factory assembly line.

eBay
Web site: www.ebay.com
Although eBay started out as a place where people could sell everything 
in their attics, it has matured into a place where all sorts of equipment is 
bought and sold. Companies sell excess equipment here. Old home theater 
gear is available in the listings. Even new stuff is being sold online. You never 
know what you are going to find here, and it is a “let the buyer beware” envi-
ronment. You indeed get what you pay for. Nonetheless, you can get a good 
handle for street prices for used gear here, and we’ve known people who have 
built their home theater by trading up equipment through eBay, spending a 
fraction of what they would have if they had bought new components in stores.
Other Sources
Almost any major retail store chain where you might purchase home theater 
equipment has a Web site. These sites often contain information centers 
about home theater and are a good stop before going to meet the geeks at 
the store. For instance, Circuit City has a starter section on the basics of 
home theater (supplied by the folks at Consumer Reports). Sears has its 
Buying Guides.
In addition to these information boutiques, here are some other sites for you 
to sample.
