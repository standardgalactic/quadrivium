At last someone has got the ofﬁcial rights
to make the computer game of Trivial
Pursuit. There have been several look
alikes but this one from Domark is the
real McCoy.
Apparently, not only is it the author-
ised version but it also features a great
technical innovation called uniload. This
is a unique system allowing a universal
question tape to be loaded into either
the Spectrum, C64 or Amstrad.
The game will be launched at the
PCW show in September and will set you
back a mere 114.95 - cheaper than the
board game!
Martech has a new release due in
August. W.A.R. is the story of a mech-
anical race whose sole purpose is to seek
out and conquer. The latest victim of this
lust for power is, of course, the Earth.
The task is to save the world -  which
seems to be getting into a lot of scrapes
lately, Now you can play at W.A.R. but
look out for the unmerciless Droidians.
A'n'F has recently launched a 'true
arcade adventure' entitled Core. The
action takes place in real time with full
graphical display, plenty of puzzles and
over 1000 locations.
The object of the game is to guide
Asteroid Andy around a labyrinth of
tunnels to ﬁnd nine parts of a biological
memory bank which will reveal to you
the cause of the sudden and tragic death
of all the scientists on the asteroid. A bit
unproductive but probably better than
saving the world again.
The game is for the C64 and costs
0195.
The wild west once again reaches
your computer screen, this time in the
form of a new release from US Gold.
The Law of the West, sees you en-
rolled as sherrif of Gold Gulch with the
job of cleaning up the town. Gunslingers,
desperadoes and outlaws combine their
evil forces to bring violence to this pion-
eer town. Clean it up or you lose your
badge. However, although y ou can
shoot to k ill when it  comes t o the
gunslingers etc. mind y ou don't g o
round gunning down innocent people
as this won't do your ratings any good.
The Law of the West is available now
priced i9•95 on cassette and 04.94 on
disk.
Adventure Line
0
There is now a new adventure from the
All American Adventures fold entitled
Questprobe featuring none other than
the Human Torch and the Thing. Re-
member those characters fr om t he
famous Marvel comics?
It was written by Scott Adams, well
known for his prowess as an adventure
programmer, and it is the third in the
Quest probe series.
The C64 version costs 0 . 9 5 o n
cassette and 114.95 on disk.
STATEMENTS
The ofﬁcial Trivial Pursuit
Also on the adventure scene, but this
time in the post nuclear age, after the
holocaust, Mind Games springs into
action w it h  T ime Trax. This  game
involves the forces of good versus the
Dark Ones in a battle to the death in
various different ages o f  man and
before.
Your performance is rated at the end
of each game and you can progress from
Pudding to Demigod a  rather amazing
transformation by anybody's standards.
5
of the Rings Trilogy
It should be in the shops now and the
C64 version is priced ai £9.95.
If you're a fan of Tolkien's novels
then you can now have a ,full set on
computer. The Lord of the Rings has
arrived for the C64 to join the Hobbit. It
is of course from Melbourne House and
in a bumper pack as the amount of
material demands.

r Multi-Releases",
Contrary t o popular belief that the
summer is a bad time to launch several
new products, A riolasoft is going for it in
a big way at the moment.
Ariolasoft has recently imported a set
of programs from Holland all of a very
different nature.
Floyd the Droid is a robot who needs
to be programmed to clean up London's
ﬁlthy sewers. You'll have to wipe out
bats, rats and crocodiles (in London?).
Map Britain i s  a n  educational
program in which you climb aboard
your helicopter and try and get yourself
where you really want to go. Designed
to polish up your geography, it's all very
well, but who wants to go to Milton
Keynes anyway?
Databsis, is as it sounds, a database
for the C64 and is priced competitively at
f9.95. Throw away those index card
boxes!
All these programs are for the C64
and are being handled in the UK by
Ariolasoft f o r t h e Dutch company
Radarsoft
Hard Lines
Kempston has now launched a mouse
which is compatible with the C64 and
Amstrad CPC6128D. Compatibility is
achieved by a simple ﬂick of a switch.
The Kempston mouse uses an optical
system to decode movements of an
internal tracker ball and is precisely
monitored by the interface using a
simple p o rt  read . According t o
Kempston, this feature means that the
protocol can be easily incorporated into
existing or future graphics or business
packages.
The mouse is £69.95 including VAT.
Remaining in  t he graphics area,
Micro Peripherals has launched a six
colour high speed plotter. However
you'll need to save up a bit more pocket
money for this one since it'll cost you

.
As well as releasing the holocaustic
game Time Trax, Argus Press software
has decided to go for the slightly gentler
market with the release of Rupert and
the Ice Palace. On the Bug Byte label the
game involves all your furry friends from
those halcyon pre-school days and is a
budget price at £2.99.
Speaking of budget software, Robtek
has decided to go ﬁve steps ahead of
everyone else and is releasing 50 games
on one tape for the C64. They are all
brand new games so you don't have to
worry that half of them are the ones you
got fed up with in 1983 and the whole
cassette costs a mere 19.95.
The Americana range from US Gold
is expanding beyond belief. There are
now seven titles for the C64 and two for
the C-16. The C64 cassette titles are 8eer
Belly Bores Brew Biz, Nuclear Nick,
Necromancer and The Hulk. On disk for
the C64 are all these, except The Hulk,
plus 0/lies Follies, Breakdance and New
York City. The C-16 games are Robo-
knight and The Hulk.
The printer/plotter is the Sekonic
SPL -  430 and is a  high resolution
professional plotter with an accuracy of
0.025mm. There are 56 resident plotter
commands.
Parallel and serial interfaces are
standard and there is a choice of oil or
water pens.
There's also a  new printer from
Citizen, Codenamed the LSP-10. It is
described by Citizen as a dot matrix
printer speciﬁcally for the European
market It is priced at £255 and is avail-
able now.
Star Micronics is aiming to increase
its sales by being kind to the consumers'
pockets.
Two Star printers have been reduced
in price: the 18cps Powertype daisy-
wheel printer (reduced from £349 to
1229) a n d  t h e  60cps stx-80 th e rma l
prinier ireduced tram 1149 179).
C-16 and Plus/4
Games seem to be coming through for
these machines fairly thick and fast these
days.
Tynesoft is releasing Alligata's Who
Dares Wins II and J
ally from-Software Projects) for the C-16.
Launch of the two games is provisionally
set for September.
From Bubble Bus there is Trizons for
the C-16 and Melbourne House has now
successfully converted the chart-topp-
ing Way of the Exploding Fist for this
machine.
Not content with this, however,
Melbourne House is also doing a C-16
greatest hits cassette. Featuring Wizard
and the Princess, Classic Adventure,
Roller King and Dark Tower, it costs
17.95.

Generally Speaking
Having decided that t h e  software
industry i s peopled with untrendy
beings w h o  kn o w  nothing about
modern dress habits, Bug Byte has intro-
duced its own range of designer clothes
to amend this ghastly oversight.
As yet the range only contains one
tee-shirt but, we are reliably informed
that underpants are on the way.
The clothes are designed by 1 2
old pre-teenage prodigy Mark Taylor,
an ardent fan of Bug Byte games.
We haven't been informed as to
whether Bug Byte designers will be
featuring in any major fashion shows this
season.
Still on the subject of fabric-wear for
games players, Beyond is giving away a
free tee-shirt to everyone who buys a
copy of Bounces for the C64. One snag is
that you have to buy another game as
well to qualify for the offer which is
available to mail order customers or
those shopping at the PCW show.
Bounces costs £9.95 and the tee-shirt

in the 154 I and one in the '64/•128. This does not normally
entail soldering, although a small amount will be necessary
with some machines.

Save your ﬁngers a lot of
work with our new software
service.
IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
You sit at the computer keyboard having
just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of  the superb programs
from Your Commodore. Your ﬁngers
reach for  the keyboard and press the
letters R ,  U  and N / .  You s it back
expectantly and.. .nothing happens.
Well, I'm sure that we have all had
problem before now. When i t  does
happen it's a matter of spending hours
searching through the program for any
typing mistakes. No matter how long you
look or how many people help you, you
can usually guarantee that at least one
little bug slips through unnoticed.
Here, at Your Commodore, we pride
ourselves on the quality of listing that we
print. Unfortunately, this usually means
that they are also very long, thus taking
longer to type in and leaving more room
for errors. All o f  the listings in Your
Commodore are taken straight from a
printout o f  working programs, i t  is
therefore very unusual f or  errors t o
appear in the magazine.
Because of the length of our programs
we do get a large number of requests from
readers who would like us to put speciﬁc

programs o n  tape or  disk for  them_
Obviously this is very time consuming and
means that we can't spend as much time
working on the magazine as we would
like.
The
Your Commodore Software
Service makes available all of the prog-
rams for the C64 or C128 on disk or tape
published in Your Commodore. The cost
of a cassette is i4.00 and a disk will cost
[6.00.
Unless otherwise stated all C64 and
C128 programs are available on the one
cassette so you simply need to order the
ARE FOR
one cassette.
None of the programs are protected
and we suggest that you make back up
copies before you use the programs.
All programs on the cassette will be
saved us ing a  tape tur bo routine.
However, we cannot guarantee that all
programs will work correctly with this
turbo routine present. W e  therefore
recommend that before you use any of
the programs you make a copy of the
programs on your own cassette or disk
and use this version of the program not

NO MATTER HOW GOOD A
game is, the quality o f  its
graphics always determines
whether people will give it a
second lo o k  o r  not. F or
example you could design the
worlds best shoot'em-up but
if the graphics were simply
blocks ﬂy ing around t h e
screen I  doubt that many
people would play the game
for too long.
I h o p e  that w it h  m y
graphics editor, which was
published in the August issue
of Your Commodore, you will
now be able to sit down and
design great screens for your
latest programs.
To help you on your way
you will ﬁnd with this article a
few sample graphics routines.
They are all printed in the
form of Basic loaders and will
generate a machine code ﬁle
on tape or disk as with the
program itself.
If you do get any errors
while typing the programs in,
refer back to the August Your
Commodore, t o  ﬁn d  o u t
exactly what each error is and
how to cure it. lt is also worth
pointing out at this stage that
you will not be able to use
these screens or view them
without using the editor —
for the moment at least.

is designed to be SFF (255)
(characters wide by $15 (21)
characters deep. When you
load b a c k g r o u n d  i n t o
memory do remember to set
the window size to FF*15 or
you will not be able to see
what it is. Even though the
graphics background is 244
characters wide I have only
presented a small section of
it here in the magazine. The
rest is blank, so why not try to
continue t h e  background
yourself? Remember y o u
must also have the characters
present in order to see the
background
SHIP.CHAR a n d  SHIP.
BAK are the characters and
background f o r  a  fantastic
spacesbip background. I ' m
afraid this isn't one of mine
but i s  b y  P . A .  E v e s
who h a s  k i n d l y  g i v e n
permission for us to use it in
this article. This screen is SFF
wide by $19 deep. Again only
a small section of the screen is
present so you can try to add
your own ships.
Finally SPRITES i s  a
collection of the sprites from
my la t e s t  g a m e  T R A P
marketed by Alligata. LOAD
them into the sprite editor
section o f  t h e  3INTO 1
EDITOR and have fun playing
them.
A few points worth noting
are:
1) A ll t h e  s c reens  a n d
graphics are in multi-colour
mode s o d o  remember t o
turn multi colour on.
2) The sprites a r e  multi-
colour.
3) DON'T LO AD the .GEN
programs in t o  t h e  editor.
These are just the programs
that will generate the actual
data ﬁles on your cassette or
disk.

4) If us ing cassette, don't
forget to change the device
number in each section of the
program before attempting
to LOAD any data.
Pull Down Menus
At the end of last month's
article I  had to add a brief
section about p u l l  d o w n
menus. I made a last minute
• decision to add these menus
for a couple of reasons:
1) It looks pretty.
2) When SAVEing data it can
become v e r y  c onfus ing
working out which data you
are ac tually  s av ing. F o r
example you could think that
you were in  the character
editor and press the keys to
save only to ﬁnd at some later
stage that you actually saved
the background. On the pull
down menus each of these
commands are now separate.
Using the menus is very
simple. Press the F7 key and
the menus will appear o n
screen displaying all of the
available commands. Mov e
the reversed b a r  t o  t h e
command t h a t  y o u  w ant
using the up and down cursor
keys and press RETURN t o
activate the command. lo exit
the menu you just press F7
again.
More to Come
Obviously there will be many
people reading this article
who have no idea what user
deﬁned graphics are or how
to use them. When it comes
to scrolling a  background
even people who are good at
programming s ometimes
have problems.
However, don't despair.
In a  future issue of  Your
Commodore I will be starting
a small series of articles that
explain just how professional
programmers achieve their
effects. Any graphics will be
compatible with the 3INTO1
EDITOR. PLUS I will be giving
you some routines that you
can use in your own programs
to a n im a t e  c har ac ter s ,
backgrounds etc.
Until then, have fun with
the editor, and, if you don't
think that your ﬁngers are up
to typing all of this data, then
don't f o r g e t  t h a t  t h e
backgrounds are available on
this month's cassette and disk
and t h e  editor is  o n  t he
August cassette and disk.

Steve Carrie bringslil
you an Assembler for
your C128.6
EVERYONE WHO IS USING
their computer seriously, as
opposed t o  merely playing
with it ,  needs a n  Editor/
Assembler.
In Your Commodore, July
'86, we printed the Editor
This is the second and ﬁnal
part - the Assembler.
The Assembler
The assembler is called by the
C command to operate on
source text in RAM 1. A range
of directives allow space
reservation, byte, word and
text insertion. Symbols may
be up to 128 characters in
length a n d  post-assembly
messages det ail memor y
useage a n d  any  relevant
relocation data.
Several subcommands are
available in the C command.
S - list symbol table at end of
assembly.
L -  list program at end of
assembly.
A - assemble to memory.
These are in any order after I
the C.
CLSA -  assemble, list prog &
syn.
CA - assemble.
C -  compile only, no code
sent to memory,
CL - compile and list only.
Assembly begins at the
ﬁrst line and continues until
either the end of text or the
directive is found. Symbols up
to 127 chars. in length may
contain the following charac-
ters; a-z, 0-9, &, , % , $  and
The assembler translates
all uppercase chars. to lower-
case ex c ept i n  t h e  T :
directive.
Directives
Directive Example Function
*= • 4 1 0 0 0  s e t  assembly address
# L: #1.15000 s e t  relocation address

# VV: # W:$1000 insert word data
# R: #  r:40 r e s e r v e s  a speciﬁed number of bytes

Entering the
Assembler Code
Again, the program is given
here as hex data strings. Use
the LOADER Program from
Your Commodore, July '86
(remember to run RELOCATE
ﬁrst).
Before you begin to enter
the assembler code, ﬁrst load
the current work ﬁle which
should contain the code you
typed in  last time i.e. the
working editor code, For the
ﬁrst start address, enter 3041.
Summary of Directives
•= c o d e  assembly location

# B: by te
# W: word
# R: reserve

Summary of Operators
$ hex adec imal
% b i n a r y
high byte

# i m m e d i a t e
plus
minus
The relocation works like
this. Suppose you want t o
assemble to an address that is
oc c upied b y  a n o t h e r
program (this assembler for
example). If you went ahead,
you would likely crash the
system o r  c o r r u p t  t h e
program. The L :  directive
allows you to place the code
elsewhere, but assemble it to
run at the required address.
For example:
*=$3000
# :  $9000
This causes the code to be
placed at 9000 hex, but it will
be assembled to run at 3000
hex i.e. all JMP and ISR calls
will be assembled correctly.
After assembly, the monitor
commands may be used to
save t h e  program and/or
relocate it to the run address.
At the end of assembly, 2
sets of addresses are printed.
For example:
ASSEMBLY COMPLETE
ADDRESSES ARE.'
iASSEMBLY) $300033175
iLOCATION $9000$9175
Operators
1. $ d e c l a r e s  following number in hex. format
2. % n u m b e r  in binary format
3. < l o a d  low-order byte of 16-bit quantity
4. > l o a d  high-order byte of 16-bit quantity
5. # s t a n d a r d  6502 immediate
6. + v a l u e  of expression is increased
7. - v a l u e  of expression is decreased
Note: decimal numbers have
no preﬁx
Examples of above:
1. Ida $01
2. ldx Pf %11110011
3, Ida#<yc
4. Idy# y c
5. Ida # $OO
6. sta buffer+1
7. Ida buffer-2
This shows that the code
has an assembly address of
$3000 hex but actually resides
at 9000 hex. If no relocation
was required, the addresses
will be the same.

C 1  213
131.-ER 112121
If a n  e r r o r  occurs,
assembly stops and the error
type is printed along with the
line number in which the
error occurred. Assembly
may be stopped at any time
by the RUN/STOP key.
Bits and Pieces
The symbol table occupies
aboutl6K in RAm0following
the program. Therefore, i f
you want to assemble code in
RAM 0 in the area IC00-7FFF
hex, relocate i t elsewhere.
The assembler also uses the

Allen Webb to
improve your control
of you 64's graphics
capabilities.
IN THIS ARTICLE I WILL BE
describing t w o  r outines
which will hopefully be of
value to you.
The ﬁrst is an editor to
improve y our  handling o f
scrolling backdrops. You may
recall that a routine published
in an earlier issue of Your
Commodore allows you t o
display a  p o r t io n  o f  a
backdrop stored behind the
Basic RO M o n  the screen
(March 1986 issue). Whilst I
provided a  demonstration
program.. I did suggest that a
proper editor was necessary.
As p a r t  o f  m y  s undr y
dabblings. I have written such
an editor —  it  is  listed in
Listing 1. Before you use the
editor you must load the code
given in the earlier article.
The routine assumes that
the backdrop occupies the
area SA000 to $BFFF leaving
the area between the ROMs
free f o r  c ode, character
designs etc. The backdrop is
assumed to be SO characters
wide and 100 characters high
and can be considered to be
eight screen sized pages. You
will note that line 80 sets up
the variable CP. This is the
value put in location 53272 to
decide which characters are
shown in the backdrop. The
default value of 21 gives the
normal character set. T he
program changes back t o
normal characters f o r  t h e
menu. T h e  system auto-
matically sets multic olour
mode.
The menu offers n in e
options. You can return to the
menu at any time by pressing
FL Option one allows you to
scan each page in turn. The
pages are arranged as shown
in Figure 1 and are displayed
by pressing the appropriate
number key.
This option allows rapid
checking of the design. If you
TOP DRAW
\TOP DRAW
want t o  scroll through the
backdrop, use option two.
The cursor keys control the
scrolling.
Option three allows you
to edit a screen_ Once you've
selected the option, press the
number of the p a g e
to edit. To add characters,
place t h e  cursor a t  t h e
required position using the
cursor keys and press the key
c or r es ponding t o  t h e
character s elec ted. T h e
current character is shown as
a ﬂas hing multic olour ed
square. This ensures visibility
over any background colour.
The character will be entered
in the colour shown by the
screen border. This can be
changed by pressing F7. To
move on to a new page press
F6 followed by the number of
the new page. When y ou
enter a character, the colour
table is updated and all other
occurences o f  t h e  s ame
character will turn t o  that
32
colour. The reverse on and off
keys act as normal, to allow
use of reverse ﬁeld characters.
Similarly, the HOME key acts
as expected. The F3 and F5
keys are used to change the
background colour for  the
edit and scan modes.
Option four  clears t h e
backdrop by ﬁlling the area
behind the Basic ROM with
character 32. The colour table
is set so that all characters are
white.
Options ﬁve and six allow
you to SAVE and LOAD the
backdrop and colour table
from a  device decided by
option seven. On startup, the
device is set to eight.
To h e l p  matters, t h e
backdrop and colour table are
saved as a single block. To
load them into y our ow n
program, s imply  us e t h e
following line at the start of
your program:
10 A=A+1 : IF A=1 THEN LOAD
"Filename",8,1
Replace the eight with one if
you use a cassette.
Options eight and nine
allow you to see what the
backdrop look s  lik e i n  a
smaller window. Option eight
sets the size and position of
the window and must be used
before you try to use option
nine.
The last option is for disk
users only. If you want to omit
it, simply leave out lines 300
and 330_
Everyone seems to have
gone made over the use of
icons i n  games and other
programs. In essence, the use
of icons is fairly simple. You
simply have to check the co-
ordinates of the pointer when
a key is pressed and perform
the relevant command. The
second routine is a simple
control program allowing you
to drive a pointer icon with a
joystick in port 2.
On activation you will see
a ﬂashing hand on the screen.
This can be moved and its
position read from a register.
The c o m m a n d s  a r e
simple:
SYS 52000 tur ns  o n  t h e
pointer.
SYS 52003 turns the pointer
off.
SYS 52006 resets the pointer to
the default design.
The c ode contains t he
design f o r  a  hand. O n
activation, this  is  c opied
down to sprite position 13 in
the cassette buffer (832-894).
The routine is locked into the
IRO in t e r r u p t  a n d  w i l l
continue to run whether or
not a program is running. The
position o f  t he pointer is
returned as follows;
X pos ition —  980 leas t
signiﬁcant by te, 981 mos t
signiﬁcant byte
Y position — 982
Fire button — 984 16=button
not pr es s ed, 0 =b u t t o n
pressed
So to calculate the X position
use; 
•
XP =PEEK(981)*256+PEEK(980)
+ X Offset
and
YP = PEEK (982)+ Y Offset
Offset is  the difference
between t h e  e n d  o f  t h e
pointer and the top left hand
corner of the sprite. In the
case of the hand given here:
Y offset = 0
X offset = 24
The pointer colour cycles
through a l l  t h e  available
colours so that it is visible over
any background colour.

Stuart Cooke ﬁnds himself
under attack with CRCs
latest release TAU CETI.
TAU CETI HAS BECOME A PLANET OF
runaway robots, it is totally devoid of
human life and the planet's automated
defence systems prevent anyone from
going home.
In their inﬁnite wisdom the powers
that be have decided t o  send in an
armed ground-skimmer to shut down
the planet's fusion reactor which is in
the capital city, Centralis, this means that
the defence systems would stop working
and minimal damage should occur to
the buildings on the planet.
Of course before they can send the
skimmer to the planet they must ﬁnd a
pilot stupid enough t o  take on this
mission. Guess w ho volunteers, yes
you've guessed it, you.
The game starts with a view of your
skimmer's control panel, with y our
docked with your landing ship.
The skimmer operates in two modes
landed mode and ﬂying mode. When in
a building or resting on the ground you
are considered to be landed and can use
your on board computer to examine
maps of the city, or, if docked with the
correct type of building, re stock your
ship with essential supplies such as fuel
and missiles.
Once you launch from the landing
ship, you're on your own. Your job is to
dock with buildings scattered around
the various cities and collect cooling
rods which will eventually allow you to
shut down the reactor_ Ohl don't forget
that whenever you are ﬂying around in
any of the cities the defence systems are
out to get you.
Travelbetween the planet's cities is
made possible by a series of jump pads
which are present in the cities. All jump
pads will take you from one city to
another. You can see where any parti-
cular jump pad leads by landing and
going into map mode, which will display
a map of the planet. Then, ask for info on
a speciﬁc city. The picture of the map will
zoom into the city that you require
showing you its position and the names
of the cities around it. You will then be
given speciﬁc details about the city, such
as how heavily it is defended and where
each of its jump pads lead.
On your travels around the planet
you will come across the following types
of building. T he reactor itself, the
substations in each of the cities, civilian
supply centres, military supply centres,
fortresses and control towers. Docking is
possible with many of the buildings so
that you can go inside and use the LOOK
command to see if there are any objects
around, but I wouldn't suggest going
too close to the Fortresses or the Control
Towers as they are sure to start shooting
at you.
Control of  your ship is extremely
easy, even though there are 17 different
keys. At any one time you will probably
only use speed-up, slow-down, left,
right and ﬁre and all o f  these are
available from your joystick. Other keys
are quite easily found as you simply
press F for ﬂare, L for land, M for missile
etc. If you don't like the keys you can
always re-deﬁne them when landed.
Your view of the planet's is through a
small viewing window at the top left of
the screen. This shows you all of the
buildings in 3D getting larger as you
move towards them. What makes life
even more difﬁcult is the fact that they
gradually blend into the background as
the sun sets. Before you know it, you
could have run headlong into the side of
a building. Don't worry t o o  much
though as your ship is supplied with
ﬂares which will light up the sky and an
infra-red system which will also make
life a little easier.
Not only do you have to worry about
the buildings shooting at you but you
are bound to come up against some of
the planet's mobile defences. These are
mainly Hunters mark I, II and lii. These
are really ﬂying saucers that have a habit
of creeping up on you from behind.
Tau Ceti can be looked at from two
different angles. Firstly you could say
that it was a shoot'em up, since you can
gain points by simply ﬂying around and
blasting everything in  sight. O n  the
other hand you could also describe it as
an adventure since t he instructions
don't tell y ou about everything you
meet and a lot of the time you will have
to ﬁgure things out for yourself.
Tau Ceti is an extremely fast game
with excellent graphics and more than a
few surprises in store. If you fancy being
the saviour of a planet yet again go and
give it a whirl.

Allen Webb with a round up
of basic compilers now
available.
MANY COMMODORE 64 USERS ARE
happy to program in Basic but perhaps
become a little unhappy when it comes
to t h e  s peed o f  execution. T h e
alternative of learning a new but faster
language won't appeal to all computer
owners so a way of speeding up Basic is
required. Enter the compiler.
In this article I want to do two things:
1) Explain how  compilers work and
suggest why you might need one.
2) Comparatively review some of the
compilers curently available.
Basic Faults
First, let us consider what is wrong with
Basic. Two real drawbacks arise:
1) It's bulky.
2) It's slow.
Why is it bulky? Consider the simple
line:
10 POKE1024,23:Y=TAN(X)
If you look at how this line is stored in
memory, we get the following picture
(please note that all numbers are in
hexadecimal):
17 08 OA 00 9 7  3 1  30 32 34 2C 32 33 3A 59 B2 CO 28 58 29 0 0 0
link lin e  P O K E  1 0  2  4  ,  2  3  :  Y  = TAN ( X )
byte number
As you can see, Basic is stored as a
series of numbers. Keywords such as
POKE are stored as a single token and
numbers and other characters are stored
as ASCII values. The link bytes point to
the start of the next line and the line
number is stored as a 16 bit number. In
all, very RAM hungry.
When a  Basic program runs, the
interpretor scans each line in turn and
checks the byte sequence according to
the syntax rules. Tables help it to convert

a token to the start address of the ROM
routines. This all takes time. The real
cruncher is that this process is repeated
each time a line is executed. The process
of examining the line and sorting out the
routine to execute is called compilation.
The obvious way of  speeding up
matters is to perform compilation once
only and leave it at that. Since the only
real virtue of having an uncompiled
program is that you can list and edit the
program, once a program is ﬁnished,
38
Table 1: Benchmark 1
you don't need to list or edit it. This Wthe
fundamental idea behind sensible
languages such as FORTH and PASCAL.
These use an editor to allow you to write
and edit a  source code. Once it is
written, the code is compiled into a fast
but unlistable object code.
So h o w  d o  compilers improve
performance? In simple terms, the code
is converted into a simpler form. Key
words ar e converted t o  jumps  t o
machine code routines, variables are
rationalised and unnecessary trivia such
as link bytes are removed. The result is a
machine code program rather than a
lump of meaningless code which needs
translation. Most compilers use a library
of routines. This is tacked on to the end

size = X x .65 + 8
After a bit of algebra this equation
can be solved and shows that any source
code less than 22.9K is larger when
compiled and any above 22.9K is smaller.
As I  will describe later, there are
exceptions to this simple system.
An additional bonus is that compilers
can allow extra tricks. Some, f o r
example, allow illegal integer loops.
Benchmark lb is illegal in Basic but can
be compiled and used.
As far as I am aware, there are ﬁve
compilers currently o n  t he market.
Whilst I have used all ﬁve, I can only
comparatively review four  o f  them.
Generally, compilation is more easily
achieved if you have a disk drive, but
there are two cassette compilers around.
I will now take a brief look at some
compilers.
Table 3: Benchmark 3
Table 4: Benchmark 2
of the compiled code. For some reason
(possibly after t h e  system used i n
PASCAL), this library is generally called
p-code_
In this article, I  will refer to the
starting Basic program as the source
code, the compiled Basic as the object
code and the tacked on library as the p-
code.
Because a lot of unnecessary garbage
has b e e n  e l i m i n a t e d  d u r i n g
compilation, the object code is smaller
than the source code. Since, however,
you have the p-code tacked on the end,
the object code may not be smaller than
the source code. Generally, small source
codes will be larger on compilation and
large programs smaller. Consider a*
hypothetical compiler which gives 65%
compression and has an 8K p-code
block. If the source code is X kilobytes in
size, the object code size will be .65X in
size. The size of complete compiled
code will be given by:
Blitz (Disk Only)
This d i s k  b a s e d  c o m p i l e r  o f
German/Austrian or igin is  available
from Supersoft. A  cutdown version
called Mini-Blitz was distributed by the
now defunct STACK computers and may
still be available.
Blitz is  the most tolerant o f  the
compilers tested in that it will accept
most Basic extensions. It also gives the
most compact complete. In spite of it
being rather long in the tooth, it's my
favourite.
Blitz attempts to convert all variables
to integer unless a ﬂoating point value is
used or  if the variable is out of the
integer range.
Basic 64 (Disk Only)
Another continental pr oduc t, this
compiler i s  dis tr ibuted b y  Fir s t
Publishing. It's the most versatile of the
lot. Two "optimisers" are offered. One is
purely ﬂoating point and the other
integer. These both use p-code. A
machine code option is available with
the integer optimiser. I don't know how
this is different to p-code but it gives
faster albeit bulkier object codes. Lots of
other options are available catering for
all possible needs. Basic 64 tends to be
rather s low  when c ompiling w it h
continuous accessing of the disk. The
other remark able featur e i s  t h e
extremely obscure instruction book. I
know it's a translation from German but
it's really not good enough.
Laser Compiler (Disk a n d
Cassette)
This p r o d u c t  i s  m a r k e t e d  b y
OCEAN/OASIS and is provided as a
39
complement t o  the earlier products
Basic Lightning and Laser Basic. These
are t w o  extended Basics offer ing
excellent graphics facilities. In addition
to offering a dedicated complier for
these products, there is also a compiler
for normal V2 Basic. I shall be looking at
the normal compiler only. Both ﬂoating
point a n d  in t e g e r  o p t io n s  a r e
supported.
The product is available to those
without disk drives, which is a nice
bonus. I  found the compiler rather
pedantic a n d  i t  certainly does n't
recognise a n y  Bas ic  extensions.
Additionally, I experienced one or two
inexplicable crashes when running
compiled codes. Oasis is aware of this
and is looking into it. Laser is the fastest
when compiling. When dealing with
small programs, all compilation takes
place in the machine. This is a nice touch
that other compilers could mimic.
Petspeed (Disk Only)
This is another well known compiler
which, at one time, was distributed by
Commodore. It is now being distributed
by System Software. Whils t being
extremely pedestrian when compiling,
the resulting object codes zip along at
quite a lick. No Basic extensions are
supported but it seems to handle most
programs without coughing_ Another
oldie but goodie. The fact that Petspeed
has been rereleased at a price below E20
should add to its appeal_
letpack (Disk and Cassette)
I have seen this compiler quite some
time ago but don't have a copy so I
couldn't test it. jet pack is produced by
Ell who came up with a pretty good
compiler for the PET. Again, cassette
users will probably want to look at this
one and the low  price will b e  an
attraction.
Comparison is not easy. I shall use a
number of benchmark programs to get
some quantitative data and then make a
qualitative assessment.
Benchmark 1 simulates a commonly
encountered situation. We want to ﬁll
the screen with a speciﬁed character.
Two versions of the benchmark were
used. Version la tests a simple loop and
lb tests a  normally illegal integer
I OR/NEXT loop.

The abbreviations have the following
meanings:
IFN: integer FOR/NEXT loop used
INT: integer variable used
FP: ﬂoating point variables
MC: Basic 64 claims a machine code
mode which is faster than it's p-code
mode.
So what does this ﬁrst bench mark
tell us? Since the source code is of
minimal size (less than 256 bytes), the
size of the object code is near enough
the same size as the p-code overhead.
That being the case, there is little to
choose between Blitz (both integer and
ﬂoating point), Basic 64 (all modes) and
Laser (integar mode). Petspeed and the
Laser ﬂoating point p-codes a r e
somewhat larger.
In terms of speed, there is an obvious
increase when using integer instead of
ﬂoating point. This is inevitable since
ﬂoating point routines are slow. Floating
point is also wasteful in memory use.
Petspeed and Blitz gave the fastest
performance although t h e Basic 64
machine code mode was best of all.
Benchmark 2 doesn't tell us much
about the compilers other than show
how slow ﬂoating point routines are
(Table 2).

These ﬁgures suggest that Blitz and

slim margin.

Table 5: Overall comparison
The results are shown in table 3. This
time Blitz. Laser and Basic 64 in integer
modes were pretty well identical. Basic
64 in machine code mode and Petspeed
performed well.
One ﬁnal check to be made was a
comparison o f  compression w hen
compiling a  large program. For this
purpose. I created a synthetic program
of about 26K in size. Table 4 shows the
effect of compilation.
This t a b l e  req u ires a  l i t t l e
explanation. Petspeed saves the object
code with a complete set of variables.
Whilst this is the largest space the
program will ever occupy, it  is an
additional overhead. I have estimated
the space occupied by the variables and
have put the estimated size of object
code plus p-code in  brackets. The
second column gives the difference
between the size of the object code plus
p-code and the source code. The last
column gives the difference between
the object code and the source code and
is a direct indication of the degree of
compression.
Clearly, Blitz gives t h e greatest
overall size reduction and Pets peed the
worst. I n  terms of  compression on
compilation, there is little to choose
between Blitz. Laser and Petspeed. I
haven't Included Basic 64 in machine
code mode since it gives bulky object
code with large source codes.
OK, it's time to say which compiler is
best. Being a bit of a coward, I will not
fully commit myself since different users
seek different attributes. T o  help
comparison, I have used a well known
ranking tool. Table 5 shows a number of
criteria. T h e performance o f  each
compiler has been scored in order of
performance (1=best, 4=worst). The total
score is a simple sum of the individual
rankings. In reality, of course, different
criteria will carry different weighting.
There, I'm afraid you must place your
own priorities.
Reliability is an odd parameter which
I've included t o  add a  subjective
element. I t  reﬂects how readily a
compiler handles any program, whether
it gives unexpected errors or crashes and
general useability.
Well there you have it. Despite being
long i n  t he tooth, both Blitz and
Petspeed are still pretty good. Basic 64 is
incredibly versatile with lots of features
and i t  can offer very fast integer
programs. When it comes to program
size, ﬂoating p o in t  speed a n d
documentation, it's not quite there, As a
Basic compiler, Laser isn't quite up to the
opposition, but most users will buy it
since it compiles the excellent Oasis
extended Basics. It will therefore corner
a piece of the market on that basis alone.
I want to ﬁnish with some comments
for our friends with Commodore 128s.
You'll be pleased to hear that their are
two compilers for you. Since I don't have
a 128 I haven't tested them. You should
not, o f  course, assume that t h e
performance of these compilers is in any
way reﬂected by the 64 versions since we
are dealing with a different machine
using a different Basic. The following
comments are based on a reading of the
instruction booklet so take heed!
Petspeed 128 (Disk)
The compiler appears to support most of
basic 7.0. There are one or two oddities
but these aren't much of a problem.
There are a number of enhancements
not covered in the 64 version. These
include option long variable names,
Basic extensions and improved ﬁle
handling. The p-code overhead is about
11K and the break point at which you
achieve compression on compiling is
about 20K.
Basic-C128 (Disk)
This is the First Publishing upgrade of
Basic 64. It appears that all of the Basic 64
options are supported. I n  addition,
some enhancements are offered. I t
appears that the compiler uses its own
ﬂoating point routines giving a claimed
ﬁve fold increase in speed. If this is the
case, it is an important and valuable
feature.

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
an arcade game whic h is
addictive, fast, colourful and
very exciting then you have to
buy this.
It's a really basic platform
game with a few frills but I had
to tear myself away from it to
come and write this review.
You have to collect keys,
avoid menacing suitcases and
open a safe before dashing to
the exit to get to the next of
the 15 screens.
It's incredibly frustrating
because it's very easy to die
but having said that there's no
way that you can leave it
alone until you've achieved a
IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN SUM-
mer Games then you'd better
not have a  look  at Street
Olympics bec aus e t h e
contrast would shock you.
I know it's a budget game
but I have to say that there is
very little in the way of enjoy-
ment here.
There are four events at
which you can try your hand
and all of them are basically
the same. The sprint merely
involves running along a very
repetitive Coronation Street
type road. The faster you go,
the nearer you get t o  the
record and that's it,
The jogging ev ent is
absolutely identical s o it's

presumably in the hope of
getting a free drink at the end
of it.
There are several sections
of the game but all are fairly
similar. I'm sorry to say. It's a
platform and each screen has
to be completed in order to
progress to the next there are
various walls which get in
your way and you have to pick
up objects in order to remove
these obstacles.
certain level and then you'll
be itching to get back to it to
improve o n  y our  perfor-
mance.
The colours ar e pretty
making the screen extremely
attractive to look at and there
are one or two quite good
sound effects.
This game is not for those
who r e lis h  in t e lle c t u a l
pursuits b u t  i f  y ou want
something which will keep
you occupied for a couple of
hours without straining your
grey cells then you couldn't
do better than go and buy
this. Good fun at a very good
price.

probably best to miss out that
option and go on to the next
one which is jumping.
This is the same as the
sprinting and jogging except
that you have to leap the odd
brick wall every now  and
again.
The throwing is a variation
on the same theme except
that when you stop running
you have to throw a ball.

I can't say that i t  was
particularly addictive since
I've seen a lot like this before
and in all of them the graphics
have been better and they
have been far less tedious to
play, Beer Belly Bert is not
very agile, I  suppose it's
something t o  d o  with the
state of his liver. He seems to
ﬁnd it a little hard to move
around but that's not really
surprising w it h  his  ﬁgure.

if the cirrhosis doesn't get to

ROUND ABOUT THE TIME
of King Arthur, Merlin, the
famous magician decided to
throw a  party t o  end all
parties. So successful was it
that even many hours later, all
the guests were still sleeping
soundly having eaten and
drunk far too much. All the
ways a n d  I  was n't s ur e
whether I dared read on to
ﬁnd out if  there were yet
more ways of  spelling this
complicated word. I solved it
by presuming that every word
beginning with 'P' meant the
same.
The Eight Minds , w h o
seem to represent God,in this
good versus evil simulation,
have lost their most treasured
possessions. You have to ﬁnd
them and restore them to the
good ones whilst avoiding the
forces o f  darkness. These
items are scattered through-
guests that is apart from one.
For a certain Kormath, the
sticky ﬁngered one, was busy
stashing away as many silver
spoons and plates as he could
ﬁt into his hat.
That was bad enough, but
it was the fact that he also
took the Holy Grail and the
out time and you must utilise
the ﬂashing time portals to
enable you t o achieve this
wondrous feat. There ar e
various different ages i n
which you can ﬁnd yourself
including Wilderness, Holo-
caust, Ice Age and Dawn of
Man. These are all pretty awe
inspiring and there are an
awful lot of frightful creatures
which will make sure that you
never get where you want to
go.
The time portals have a
very nasty habit o f  disap-
pearing just when you want to
use them and then you have
to hang around for a while
waiting for  a  new one t o
appear.
A lot of this may sound as if
I didn't like the game, and
that's n o t  tr ue a t  all. it's
merely very frustrating and
fairly complicated t o  g e t
started. O n c e  y o u  hav e
managed to get on your way
then it becomes very inter-
esting and although this can
take a  while i t  is  actually
worth it.
I would recommend that
you r ead t h e  instruction
booklet a  couple o f  times
before you even load up Time
magic sword Excalibur that
annoyed everybody most of
all. Merlin promised revenge
and offered great fame and
fortune to anyone who could
recover the items. Lancelot
too promised t o  help i n
whatever way he could. And
so all that was required was a
brave knight to venture into
Kormath's dungeon beneath
the magical Stonehenge and
recover the treasure.
Your k night  has  ﬁv e
different traits which deter-
mine his  character. Virility
determines your strength and
ability t o  carry treasure.
Intellect is important for spell
casting of a magical nature
whilst holines s  i s  m o r e
concerned w i t h  c ler ic al
spells. Agility is a measure of
lock picking skills ang general
speed of mind and body and
initial hits is an indication of
how much damage your body
can suffer. The points are
I tax. Its only about 10 pages
long. Even when you've done
this you'll ﬁnd that you have
to keep referring back to it
until you have a good grasp
of what's going on.
Your ﬁrst aim should really
be to get yourself a weapon
and s ome ammunition as
there isn't really much you
can do without this amusingly
essential asset. Pos s ible
weapons are pistol, crossbow
and wand and their respec-
tive ammunition is bullet, bolt
and gem. Without these you
won't get far but at least you'll
be able to enjoy the spectacle
of yourself as a white robed
angel rising up into the wild
blue yonder.
As graphic adventures go,
it's got a lot of qualities. Your
energy is indicated by a red
heart in the bottom left of the
screen which gradually drains
of colour as your life blood
runs out. Gross but graphic.
If you're the sort of person
who wants to spend a lot of
time over a  game then I
believe that you will enjoy
this. There's quite a lot of
variety and it is tricky too.

you get the opportunity to
change the whole set as often
as you want until you end up
with a  dec ent series o f

You will need to save your
character frequently and can
have up to 16 knights stored
on disk. One slight problem is
that the disk supplied has no
write protect notch cut in the
side, so unless you cut one
yourself, you cannot save
anything! T h e  Standing

now (it was written back in

Money
ONE O F  BRITAIN'S BEST
known programmers, Tony
Crowther, started his career
working for  Alligata a  few
years a g o .  A f t e r  m a n y
wanderings, events have now
turned full circle and he is
back where he started from.
Alligata has always claimed
that his best work was written
there and his  latest game
would appear to prove the
point. Trap is quite simply one
of t he best shoot-'em-ups
that I have seen and oozes
class from almost every pore.
My initial reaction t o
playing the game was that it
looked like a thinking mans
Zaxxon. The appearance is
that o f  a  scrolling screen
(although it scrolls vertically
and n o t  diagonally). Y o u
ﬂy through gaps i n  walls,
blasting everything in sight.
But there is a lot more to it
than that. D o w n  i n  t h e
bottom right hand corner is a
small table marked A,I3 and
together with some numbers.
These indicate the number of
aliens, boats and lasers that
still remain to be destroyed
before you are allowed t o
land_ An exclamation mark in
one of the columns indicates
a ﬁgure of more than 9.
Succeed in shooting the
necessary numbers and the
background changes colour
to red allowing you to land
your craft and continue your
mission on foot in a space
version o f  commando_ But
more of that anon.
Before y o u  c a n  s tart
eliminating aliens and lasers,
you must ﬁrst negotiate your
way through a ﬁeld of space
mines. There are no points to
be scored for blasting them,
you only do it to clear a path
for yourself but even so,
careful ﬂying is necessary as
one slight collision takes you
back to the start minus one of
your lives. Control of your
ship is quite straightforward
being left and right, accelerate
and brake. Fire shoots a missile
and pulling back on the joy-
stick a n d  ﬁr i n g  s im u l-
taneously drops  a  bomb.
There ar e als o keyboard
options if you don't like using
a joystick.
Bombing is necessary for
destroying boats and f uel
dumps on the ground. Your
ship uses fuel at an alarming
rate and if you don't pick up
extra b y  bombing dumps
pretty quic k ly , y o u  ﬁn d
yourself hyperspaced to level
10 where your chances of
survival are, to put it mildly.
minimal. Also worth looking
out for the ground are the
eyes. These ac t as  radar
systems and warn the police
of your intrusion. If you don't
take o u t  t h e  ey e quickly
enough, you must ﬁght off a
convoy o f  p o l i c e  c r af t
although ther e is  a  hefty
bonus is  y ou shoot all o f
them.
If things really get to be
too much for you, you have a
smart bomb at your disposal
which ins tantly  destroys
everything o n  t h e  screen
although t he kills are not
credited to your list of things
to be shot. One ﬁnal way of
destroying something is  by
doing i t  backwards! B y
careful manoeuvring, you can
dispose of an enemy craft by
using t h e  ﬂames o f  y our
engine.
Whilst y o u  a r e  bus y
shooting ev ery thing that
moves, y ou must s till pay
attention to where you are
going. Some parts o f  the
superstructure are taller than
others a n d  a n  accidental
collision can have disastrous
effects. Watch for the dark
shadows._ There are various
types of alien craft, all of them
hostile, some of them indes-
tructable and all doing their
utmost to remove you from
the s c ene. O n e  t h a t  i s
especially worth looking out
for though is the cargo ship.
Blast this and its  cargo is
released in t o  fr ee space.
Collect the cargo and then
drop it to the little men that
are wandering about for a
bonus life.
When y ou have landed
your craft, your little pilot gets
out and you can start blasting
everything o n  foot making
sure that you don't get killed
or fall down one of the holes.
There i s  method i n  this
apparent madness for you are
searching for orbs, the local
currency. Up to four can be
carried at once (any extra just
score you bonus points) and
they are used to buy yourself
a bigger and better ship.
When you start the game. you
have no choice as to what
craft you use. I f  you have
some orbs to spend however,
then y o u  hav e access t o
different models. These give
you different ammo capaci-
ties, rates of fuel consump-
tion, cargo carrying potential
and recharge time between
zapps. Wh ich  sh ip  yo u
choose is dependent on your
own personal taste and is
limited only by what you can
afford. Should you have the
misfortune to get hit or walk
off the end of the platform,
then you return to the begin-
ning of the level although you
do n o t  suffer t h e  added
indignity of losing a life.
Everything about Trap is
well t h o u g h t  o u t .  T h e
graphics look stunning, even
the instructions s how t h e
pages of a book turning as
they display t h e  different
types of alien craft that you
are likely to encounter. The
game itself plays exception-
ally well and possesses that
indeﬁnable little something
that makes you want to have
"just one more go." There is
even a hidden demo mode
but as we are under strict
instructions from Alligata,
you will have to ﬁnd this for
yourself. I t  lasts for  about
seven to eight minutes and is
the music for the game witIla
character reminiscent o f
those huge, bald overseers
that they have in all the old
ﬁlms about galley  slaves
where he does nothing but
beat his large drums in order
to give the rowers a rhythm.
The m u s i c  i s  h i g h l y
atmospheric and there is also
a stereo mix for you to play
and hum along to.
If Trap is going to be the
standard of products from the
Tony C r ow t her / Alligat a
partnership, game players
everywhere will b e hoping
that they stay together for a
long time.

to be an extremly easy way to
lose money very quickly and
I'm pleased to see that the
computer version is just as
demanding.
The object of the game is
to rescue yet another princess
from an evil wizard who has
summoned z ombies  a n d
demons to thwart your knight
in shining armour who is in
quest to free the unfortunate
young lady.
The instructions with the
game are minimal and I feel
that a little more help would
have been useful. As it stands
you will have to play through
MUTTON DRESSED UP AS
lamb is the best description
for this game. The graphics
are superb but the game's
style is as old as them thar
hills.
As sheriff of (US?) Gold
Gulch a man's gotta do what a
man's gotta do, and all this
man's gotta do is survive until
sunset. In a frontier town like
Gold Gulch that ain't easy.
All manner o f  dudes,
hombres and wimmin folk
cross the path of the lawman
from sun up to sun down and
some o f  these ar e mean
gunslingers. Everyone lives
on a knife edge and a line of
smooth talking is needed if
your going to avoid any early
trip to Boot Hill.
Even the Doc's like a bear
with a sore head. Him and
liquour ain't no strangers and
on a morning he sure needs
to be handled gently 'cos
you're gonna n e e d  h i m
before long.
All day long them Daltons
are trying to rob the bank, hi-
jack the stagecoach or make
off with the railroad payroll.
Just one darn thing after
another. If your draw ain't as
fast as a rattler strike you're
deader than a night in Milton
Keynes.
Strangers k eep drifting
into town and you never know
what's on their mind. Take
the Mexicali Kid, he's got so
many notches on his gun it
looks like a fancy piece of
many screens advancing your
knowledge little by little.
Each k n ig h t  has  t w o
chances to succeed. The ﬁrst
time that he is hit by one of
the creatures h e  loses his
shining armour and ends up
dashing around in a loincloth
until h e  c an r egain h is
armour. His weapons change
too as  h e  ﬁghts  better
equipped demons and takes
over their  arms when h e
defeats them.
I loved this game but it is
very, very difﬁcult t o  play.
Even t h e  ﬁr s t screen i s

ghosts a n d  goblins  w i l l
overun y o u  i n  seconds,
fretwork and yet a nicer guy
I've never met, if you know
how to handle him.
Miss Rose from the saloon
and Miss April the school-
ma'am are poles apart but
behind this hard steel badge
beats the tender heart of a
lonely lawman and I know I'll
have to make up my mind one
day but till then...
The ﬁrst time I played this
game I was impressed. The
animation o f  the graphics
looks almost like a cartoon
but each time you play the
story is very much the same.
Each time a character appears
you have to select a response
to their opening gambit from
four alternatives which range
from the sickly polite to the
meanest varmint who ever
walked. T h e ir  res pons e
depends on the tone of your
conversation and if you're not
careful you'll have a ﬁght on
your hands.

characters wandering about
in the distance run for cover.
A gunsight appears and you
must lead it to your target.
The graphics of the lawman's
right arm as you wave his gun
around are a higher calibre
than a Remington shotgun.
This part of the game does
bring out the worst side of
human nature. When a child
with a secret appeared on the
screen as I was playing the
game in the ofﬁce, a chorus
went up of 'Shoot the kid!'

and who am I to disappoint
such a n  a p p r e c i a t i v e

At the end of the game
you get a rating measured by
the number of villains killed,
your success i n  romantic
engagements, the number of
innocent people y ou shot
unnecessarily a n d  t h e
number of crimes you foiled.
In fact, everything you did as
lawman for the day is assessed
and an icon chart is produced
with a numeric score.
How long does the game
last? You may well ask how
long is a cowboy's lasso°. You
can go through the game in
no time at all if you shoot
everything in sight. The editor
proved this to me, I worry
about him sometimes (l don't

Your ﬁrst task is to ﬁnd a

Unfortunately, the detector is

This search is not helped by
the fact that, as time passes,
the batteries in your torch
start to fade and the sceen

There is an ample supply
of fresh batteries in the mine
so you have t o  take them

involves manipulating t h e

you to pause for meals or to
save the game at bedtime.
There I; also a HELP facility
which can prove useful, if a
little enigmatic.
Not all o f  the mine is
approachable by  using the
doors and antigrav lifts so you
must make use of the teleport

Antenna alignment is still a

and closed to reveal a new
room, Sometimes it is difﬁcult
to know if you have come up
through the ﬂoor or simply
passed through a doorway.
This means you can't always
tell where your next move
will bring you. Producing a
map is  essential. Why  not
enlist Andy's help, you never
know.
I've tried to enter into the
spirit o f  the game by  not
disclosing any of the solutions
to the problems. The manual
has several tantalising hints
for the beginner and added to
a modicum of common sense
the items which are encoun-
tered w i l l  s oon hav e a
relevance to the game.
A few of the puzzles are
related to one another and
often t h e  mos t obv ious
course of action is not nec-
essarily the best.
CORE promised hours of
amusement and I  have n o
doubts t h a t  i t  w ill.  Just
keeping t h e  lights  o n  i s
enough o f  a  battle. This
game's a  min e  o f  enter-
tainment.

THANK GOODNESS RADAR-
soft d i d n ' t  d e c i d e  t o
investigate total experience
software with the release of
Floyd the Droid. Smellivision
would be too much to bear as
the little robot ploughs his
way through the sewers of
some of the world's greatest
capital cities.
Floyd is a Probot (PRO-
grammable roBOT) specially
equipped f o r  his  task o f
cleaning u p  thes e lesser
known high spots of the great
cities. Looking a  little lik e
R2D2, Floyd trundles along
on wheels until h e  meets
something which offends his
sensory apparatus. This might
be a  waste blockage or  a
leaking crack in the pipe but
there ar e greater terrors
underground. Bats , rats ,
alligators a n d  des perate
criminals rush around in the
gloom and they are joined by
Floyd's malfunctioning pre-
decessors w ho cracked u p
under the strain.
Probots are equipped to
face any problem. They have
laser guns i n  their  heads
which not only break down
blockages b u t  als o mak e
suitable weapons for dealing
with bats and criminals. Rats
and alligators are dealt with in
a simple but efﬁcient way,
Floyd leaps into the air and
crushes them underfoot.
We ﬁr s t  m e e t  o u r

under i n  t h e  sewers o f
London. The screen displays
the ﬁrst pipeline maze which
GEOGRAPHY HAS ALWAYS
been a painful subject for me.
The incisive sarcasm of my old
teacher still rings in my ears. If
only I'd had this educational
game to help me things might
have been different.
Maps Br it a in  mak es
learning fun by combining a
quiz with a touch of ITV's
'Treasure Hunt'. The star of
this program, however, is the
scrolling British countryside
rather than the rolling Rice-
ish backside of the television
game.
The main options allow
you to ask the computer to
ﬁnd a particular place in the
British Isles, play a quiz game
gives w a y  t o  t h e  m a in
menu/scoreboard screen.
The display shows Floyd's
status on the left and the
sewer's c ondition o n  t h e
right. All problems are stated
as p e r c e n t a g e .  W a s t e
blockages and leaks must be
reduced to zero but vermin
only need to be reduced by
20%. T h e r e  i s  a n o t h e r
condition to be met and that
refers to the minimum score
required to allow entry to the
next sewer.
The bottom of the screen
displays the options which
control Floyd's m o d e  o f
action. The part of the sewer
labyrinth whic h Floyd has
investigated can be viewed,
he can be switched into one
of three operation modes
(manual, semi-automatic or
automatic) and h e  can b e
programmed f o r  speciﬁc
actions in automatic mode.

The ﬁnal option takes you
into the sewer with Floyd and
the graphics are very good at
this point. We see Floyd in the
pipeline fr om an elevated
angle giving a 3D effect. Now
the joystick is used to move
with the computer or dash
around i n  a  helicopter t o
nominated towns.
The quiz game has four
variations. The ﬁrst two games
are similar in that you have to
name t o w n s  a n d  c it ies

The third game is  naming
islands and countries in and
around the British Isles and
the ﬁnal g a me  inv olv es

Apart from the ﬁrst option
which involves a  limited
number of large cities, the
level o f  t he quiz  is  high

jet-setter like me.

search of his prey.
Occasionally, the pipeline
loops right over Floyd's head.
These are danger points and
you should prepare yourself
for all eventualities. A touch
of humour is provided by the
Probot's method of awaking
bats. By  pressing t he ﬁr e
button a  speech bubble
appears with the word 'Boo'
written in it and this is echoed
by speech synthesis.
When a  c r eatur e o r
obstacle is located, the screen
switches to a 2D side view of
the sewer. The obstacles are
all dealt with automatically by
Floyd's RO M programming
but vermin can be dealt with
either manually o r  auto-
matically.
For automatic mode and
method o f  dealing with an
opponent can be set using
one of the sub-menus from
the main menu screen. Here
each ty pe o f  f oe can b e
selected by icon and a series
of a dozen moves may be
programmed in t o  memory.
When in auto or semi-audo
mode, Floyd will execute the
actions and hopefully defeat

Stuart Cooke takes a look at
what is available for the
C128.
WHEN THE C128 WAS LAUNCHED, IT
was aimed at two different markets. The
ﬁrst aim was to attract the games player
and the second to break into the small
business market, a market to which the
earlier Commodore 64 is not entirely
suited.
So has  Commodore's little plan
worked? Being honest it  has and it
hasn't. The games player is well catered
for with the C128's compatibility with
the Commodore 64. However, very few
manufacturers ar e launching games
speciﬁcally for the C128. After all wh‘
writer a game for one market, i.e. the
C128 market, when you can write for the
CM market and sell to all 128 owners as
well?
As for the business angle, things are
looking very good. As you are no doubt
aware the Commodore 128 has an in-
built Z80 processor and has the ability to
run CP/M software. Now packages such
as Wordstar, DBASE and SAGE are all
becoming available at reasonable prices.
In a future issue of Your Commodore we
will be taking a very close look at CP/M
explaining exactly what it is and how you
should use it. All of the above packages
and many more will be discussed in
further detail in this future article.
The C128 in, its 128 mode, has taken
off s urpris ingly  w e ll.  Numer ous
packages have become available and all
use the C128 to its full. Most of the
software that runs in 128 mode is far
superior to that that is available in CP/M
mode. The fact that it has been written
speciﬁcally for the C128 and it is a lot
newer probably has something to do
with this.
So down to business, what exactly is
available for the C128? Is it any good?
How much does it cost? Read on and
ﬁnd out.
Playing around
As previously mentioned there are very
few games around for the C128. even the
American market seems to be very slow

on this front which is a great shame as
the machines massive memory could
lend itself to some very good games.
Mastertronic is the ﬁrst company to
launch C128 games software. I'm afraid
that the games are nothing new but are
11
expanded versions of a couple of earlier
C64 games, Kik Start and The Last V8,
both of which were very popular on the
C64. The Last VS ﬁnds you seated in a car
trying to get back to your base before
you die due to radiation poisoning. On

Olt 1110011111111111111NOMIIIIMMINIIIIIIIP
the C64 you must drive around the city
and get to the underground bunker
once you are there you can try and ﬁnd
your base, The C128 version has an extra
screen at the beginning where you are
on the planet surface and must collect a
number of objects before you gain
access to the city.
All in  all great fun, although a
different game to play.
Kikstart ﬁnds y o u  sat  at op a
motorbike trying to navigate yourself
over a number of obstacles. You play
against either a computer controlled
opponent or you can give a friend a race.
This game otters nothing spectacular
though it is quite fun to play. The only
difference between this and the C64
version is the addition of some more
tracks where you can try your hand.
CR1 is supposed to be launching a
C128 version at the Rocky Horror Picture
Show though at the time of writing it
hasn't been seen.
As far as we on Your Commodore are
aware, that is all the games that are
available for the C128. No doubt some of
you out there are going to prove us
wrong. I hope you do as the computer
certainly warrants some more games.

Down to Business
As previously mentioned the C128 is
extremely well supported with some
excellent 'business' software. Visa,
Precision, Commodore and a company
new to the UK. Timeworks have all
launched a range or products.
As for the future we will have to wait
and see, every day we hear of new
products that are planned or due for
release. Your Commodore will of course
review all of these products as they
become available.

Stuart Cooke has a look at
spread sheets currently
available for the C1211.
A SPREAD SHEET IS ONE OF THE MOST
important tools for anyone who has to
deal with a large amount of numerical
data. Basically a spread sheet consists of
a piece of paper split into numerous
boxes, rather like a piece of graph paper.
Each box is  then given a  particular
'function', For example the box at the
top left hand side corner could be the
amount of money in a bank account.
The ones below it could be deductions
from the account, then at the bottom
you could have the new bank balance.
You could then work across the sheet
using the columns t o  represent the
amount of money in the account at the
end of each month.
Obviously u n t il t h e  adv ent o f
computers all of the calculations in each
of the columns had to be worked out by
hand, now the computer has made life
much easier for  you. You can put
formulae into the boxes. For example in
our bank account spread sheet the
formula at the bottom for the total could
be something like: NEWTOTAL=01 D-
TOTAL- SUM OF ALL DEDUCTIONS.
Obviously the formula would not be
entered like this but is does give you an
idea about what is possible.
SwiﬁCalc128, from Timeworks again,
is the simplest program for the 128. In
keeing with all o f  Timeworks' other
programs, all commands are available
from pull down menus, this makes it
very easy to ﬁnd the comand that you
want. Viza Star is  by  far the most
complex program but again has far
superior features w it h  i t s  inbuilt
database, programmability etc . A l l
commands in Viza Star are also available
from menus making it easy to ﬁnd the
one that you want. Even so Swittcalc is
more t h a n  adequat e f o r  m o s t
applications.
Both of the spreadsheets can be
interfaced w it h  their  corresponding
wordprocessors a n d  databases, this
means that transfer from one program to
the other is  free fr om error. very
53
important i f  y ou were producing a
ﬁnancial report for a company.
The actual size of the spread sheet
available is far greater than that of the
screen. This means that as you move
around the screen the columns and rows
will scroll across the screen so you can
always see the information which you
require. Swiftcalc allows you to have up
to 250 rows and 250 columns in which
you can place information. Viza Star has
64 columns and 100 rows. As you cart see
both allow very large work areas.
When you come to printout your
spreadsheet you will of course hit a snag.
At a guess your printer will only be 80
characters wide. This means that you will
have to printout your spreadsheets in
pieces or write them in such a way that
they only take up 80 columns. SwiftCalc
gets around this in a very interesting
way, it allows you to print the program
sideways on any printer that is capable of
graphics. In other words all information
is printed at 90 degrees to its normal
position. You can now print your spread
sheets as wide as you want. Sideways is
available separately as a C64 program
and will work with information from
most spread sheets.

When it comes to having a look at
your information what could be clearer
than a graph? The GRAPH command in
Viza Star allows you to turn all of your
numerical data into line and bar graphs,
it is even possible to print pie charts.
When your graph is ﬁnished you can
dump it to a printer for a permanent
record.
Swilicalc doesn't support graphics
but you can transfer the ﬁle to the Data
Manager 128 program and use the
graphic facilities in that.
Both packages come complete with
very comprehensive manuals. Viza Star
has an excellent tutorial which takes you
through using t he spreadsheet and
database. As usual with the Timeworks
manual, t h e y  a r e  extremely w e ll
presented and explain every function
clearly. One chapter of the manual is
given over to 'Using Swittcalc on an
Everyday Basis' this comes complete
with sample spreadsheets for your own
use.
Choosing The Right One
As with all the programs that we have
looked at 'you get what you pay for'.
Both programs are extremely good, the
Timeworks one being particularly easy
to use and ideal for someone who wants
a bas ic  spreadsheet. Viz a Star  is
extremely powerful and is a must for
anyone who intends using a spreadsheet
for serious business use.

DATABASES
Stuart Cooke with an
illuminating look at the 0 2 8
databases currently available.
A COMPUTER IS AN IDEAL DEVICE FOR
storing information. A  database
program simply lets you turn your com-
puter into an electronic card index
system, a high tech version of those little
plastic boxes with the cards in them.
If you have ever used a card index
system then you probably know that you
need to design a format for each card.
For example if you were setting up a list
of members of a computer club you may
set the cards up so that they have the
following information:
NAME
ADDRESS
TELEPHONE
COMPUTER
MEMBERSHIP OWING
Well, a database program is used in
the same way, you simply set up the
format for each of the cards or records
arid enter the information.
Because the information is now in a
computer you can do a lot more with it.
For example you may want a list of all
club members who live in London. With
the card box type of system you would
have to go through each card in turn and
make notes as you went along. A
computer is much more versatile than
that as it takes all of the donkey work
away from you. You could instruct the
computer to give you a list of all the
people who live in London AND who
still haven't paid their membership fee.
You could even get the database to print
out a list of the people's names and
addresses on to sticky labels ready to go
onto envelopes.
Most database programs also let you
transfer details between the database
and a wordprocessor or a spreadsheet.
This means that you could then send
personalised letters to every one who
owed money with their name at the top
of the letter and the amount owing in
the correct place on the letter.

Of all the packages that we will look
at here, Superbase is probably the
easiest one to use for this type of
application since you can have both this
and Superscript in memory at the same
time.
Viza Star is a combined database and
spreadsheet program which is loaded
into memory as one unit. If you wanted
to use information from the database
with Viza Classic then you would have to
store the information that you require
on disk, then LOAD the word processor
so that yo u  could print o u t  t h e
information. I must stress that this is the
norm for  transferring data between
programs and that it doesn't cause any
problems whatsoever.
Data Manager 128 from Timeworks
also works on the same principle as Viza
Star and the different programs must be
loaded separately.
Obviously as with the word proces-
sors, you get what you pay for. As the
more expensive packages Superbase
and Viza Star are the more complex and
versatile programs. Both o f  these
programs have the ability to be pro-
grammed. This means that you can
actually write a program to control the
way that the database works, just as you
would a Basic program.
55
A programmable database i s
extremely useful. Let's take a look at the
typical ofﬁce where a program such as
this would be used. For a start most
people in the ofﬁce will probably not be
computer literate. Most databases are
quite complex to use and have lots of
commands available, to get a database
up and running may take quite a
number o f  key presses. The ofﬁce
worker is going to get lost and probably
mess things up. Now if you were to write
a program that LOADed the correct
database into memory and then gave all
of the options that the user would ever
need on a simple menu, wouldn't things
be easier? For example with our club
membership list t h e user may b e
presented with the following options:
1) ADD NEW MEMBER
2) CHANGE EXISTING INFORMATION
3) SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC INFORMA-
TION
4) FINISH
Now isn't that a lot easier than having
to remember a  lot o f  complicated
instructions?
Superbase is probably the most
powerful database of the three that have
been mentioned. Obviously this does

mean that it is quite difﬁcult to use,
especially f o r  s omeone n e w  t o
computers. The manual wihch accom-
panies t h e  program c an o n ly  b e
described as excellent, the ﬁrst 56 pages
are devoted t o  giving a  beginner's
tutorial. Sit down with this for a few
hours and you should no longer be
frightened by the program.
As if this wasn't enough Precision has
also launched a  book  called quite
simply, Superbase the Book. If you have
never used a database before this is an
excellent supplement to the manual as it
explains some of  the more complex
operations in greater detail.
Viza Star is  probably t h e  mos t
bafﬂing o f  the three programs. and
probably the hardest to get the hang of.
Usually a spreadsheet and a database are
totally separate programs. With this
package they do rely on each other

quite heavily. For  example, i f  y ou
wanted to write a program you actually
write it on the spreadsheet. Again a
training course is supplied with the
program s o  y o u  s hould hav e n o
problems getting to grips with it.
Data Manager is the most simplistic
of the three packages, even so it is
extremely powerful and mor e than
adequate for most applications. As with
Timeworks' wordprocessor, all t h e
commands in this program are selected
from a series of pull down menus. This
makes it extremely easy to use. Again a
tutorial is included in the manual to help
get you going_ Data manager is very well
suited to dealing with lots of numerical
data. The example given in the tutorial is
of a n  expense for m f o r  a  week.
Obviously the numerical functions of
this program are not as powerful as
those in the combined spreadsheet/
56
database of Visa Star but once again are
adequate for most applications.
Both Data Manager 128 and Visa Star
have graph options built into them.
These allow you to graphically represent
any numerical information within the
database.
So which o f  the three programs
should you buy. As a standard database
they all perform equally well, with Data
Manager 128 as the easiest to use. If you
are looking for something a little more
elaborate then I suggest that you look at
both Visa Star and Superbase t o  see
which one suits you best. Personally I
would use Superbase since having a
combined database and wordprocessor
(Superscript) in memory at the same
time is extremely useful to me. Other
people w ho use spreadsheets more
often would obviously b e  mor e at
home with Viza Star.

Irk Doyle explains the triple
personality of the C128.
WHEN I S  A  COMPUTER N O T  A
computer? Arguably, it's when there's
no software to run on it. This has been
the case with the Commodore 128 so far.
'Alt', you may say, 'there's a wealth of
C64 and CP/M software available', but
where are the dedicated 128 goodies
would be my reply? With all this memory
available and an 80-column screen it's
like running a Rolls Royce on parafﬁn.
Things are changing. Already there
are t w o  games f r o m Mastertronic
(Kickstart and The Last V8) and a bumper
issue of The Rocky Horror Show in CRL's
pipeline. Precision Software has  a
brilliant compendium o f  Superscript
and Superbase competing with Visa's
Classic wordprocessor. Many  mor e
companies are contemplating launching
their own and imported titles, so now is
the time to revisit the 128 and study the
pros and cons of this hybrid machine.
A computer with several modes of
operation i s  a  n e w  slant o n  t h e
incompatibility problems which have
beset C o m m o d o r e  s i n c e  t h e
replacement of the Vic 20 with the C64.
At last, buying a new machine does not
mean throwing out the old software and
brining in the new. In C64 mode the
machine operates  ex ac tly  a s  it s
predecessor. Well, almost!
Most 64 software runs happily on the
128 and t h e  earlier models whic h
produced the ocassional 'black' sprite
have been superceded by a modiﬁed
machine. Some programs still hiccup but
I've never found this to be a major
problem. The real bane o f  my  life
emanates from companies who give the
impression that their product is C128
compatible when all they mean is that
it's a C64 program. Book publishers are
also guilty of this sin and the only advice
I can give is encapsulated by that old
legal saw 'caveat emptor' let the buyer
beware.
The styling of the 128 breaks away
from the old Vic casing which we've
come to know and love. It also provides
a substantial shift from the rich man's toy
appearance of the Plus/4 which belied
the powerful nature of the machine. In
the 120 we see a stylish keyboard with a
numeric p a d  w h ic h  look s  rather
businesslike and PC-ish. With the work
station style 128D, the PC image is
complete; built in monitor, disk drive
and detachable keyboard.
My criticisms are few but heartfelt.
Creamy plastic i s  a n  aesthetically
pleasing colour but it does attract the
dirt. With grubby little ﬁngers such as
mine typing with gloves on seriously
inhibits my two-ﬁnger typing speed.
Spark Stuart, our esteemed editor,
has a  personal problem whic h h e
managed t o  k eep secret until t he
appearance of the 128, he's a ﬂasher. Not
the grubby mac in the park variety (as far
as I know) but the static electric charge
type. Our walking Van de Graf generator
only has to look at the joystick port and
his ﬁnger glows  lik e  ET's, closely
followed by a ﬂash of such intensity that
the internal chips are deep fried in_no
time at all.
My ﬁnal small grizzle is about the
arrowed cursor keys. One good thing
about the Plus/4 was that the equivalent
keys wer e laid o u t  , in a  diamond
formation, on the 128, they are in line.
The 128 has three major modes of
operation: C64, 128 and CP/M. This is
further enhanced by  the 80-column
option. The 128 mode's Basic is a vast
improvement on the dismal language
with which the C64 was cursed. Popular
rumour has it that a more advanced
language was planned for the 64 but
disagreements l e d  t o  i t s  n o n -
implementation. At  least Version 7.0
Basic supports sprites, high resolution
graphics, sound and disk access.
A disk drive is a must with so much
memory available and if you want to

tl
I.
access the CP/M mode it is obligatory
because the system only works with
disks. The 1571 disk drive, which is
rec ommended, h a s  o n e  m a j o r
advantage over the old 1541, it's faster. It
won't break loading records but it's a
vast improvement.
While I'm on the subject of disk
drives, let me explode one myth. The
new drives behave with all the sluggish-
ness of the 1541 in C64 mode so don't
expect any improved performance if
you're thinking of plugging one into
your old 64.
A bigger. better Basic has o n e
apparent drawback. It takes up more
memory than the earlier versions but
this is counterbalanced by the fact that
programs take up less space because the
interminable PEEKS and POKEs of earlier
versions have been replaced by short,
sharp commands.
This is  further enhanced by  the
banking system used. This has nothing to
do with Nat West or Barclays but is the
way in which several layers of memory
are overlayed o n  the same memory
locations and t h e  computer selects
which one it must use. This means that
from power up almost 120K of memory
is available to the user. In the 64 almost
261< of memory was reserved for Basic
leaving only 38K for programs. Banking
means that a more comprehensive Basic
can be housed in an apparent 8K of
memory!
The n e w  Basic i s  y et another
development of the original Microsoft
Basic which means that any program
written for Commodore machines from
the early PET machines onwards will run
on t h e  1213 with one proviso. The
limitation i s  t h a t  t h e  in t e r n a l
architecture o f  the machines are so
different that any PEEK, POKE or SYS
commands will not work on the 128.
I've already mentioned that there are
BASIC commands speciﬁcally for sound
and graphics. These are supported by
further keywords f o r  helping w it h
programming e . g .  TRACE, T RO N,
DELETE. Plus  m o r e  variations o n
FOR/NEXT loops such as DO/WHILE,
D O / U N T I L B E G I N / B E N D  a n d
IF/THEN/ELSE.
Thank goodness for the implement-
ation of the PRINT USING command
which puts an end to line upon line of
string manipulations f o r  laying o u t
mathematical tables.
CP/M compatibility was ﬁrst mooted
with the appearance of the 64. It's feasi-
bility was undermined by the limitations
of the 40 column screen. With a built in
Z80A and the 8563 video processor, the
128 is in a much better position to use
the best of the available software. The
only problem is the expense of some
CP/M program's but the prices now
seem to be dropping to meet the needs
of a new generation of users.
CP/M 3.0 is a Disk Operating System
(DOS) which was speciﬁcally written for
handling disk ﬁles in a business environ-
ment. Before IBM took over this ﬁeld
with PC/DOS, CP/M was the ﬁrst and
only system of its kind. As you can
imagine, this means that there is a
mountain of software to support CP/M.
The o n e  limitation i s  t h a t  a l l
programs must require less than 59K of
workspace. This i5 no major limitation
because a lot of software was designed
for 48K machines. The use of random
access ﬁling on disk means that the data
can be pulled from disk to be worked on
as and when it is required. In this way the
effective storage space is expanded way
58
beyond the apparent limitations of a 48K
machine.
The DOS is  also a programming
language and user originated programs
can be devised. The manual does not
help greatly with this and the dedicated
Commodore CP/M manual is not easy
to understand. However, a search of a
good computer book shop will turn up
some of  the gems which have been
written in the past for those eager to
understand this new environment. Be
warned, this is a programmer's language
and s ome aspects a r e  v ery  us er
unfriendly, often it  is  better to buy
application software than to struggle
through a program of your own.
For t h e  80-column mode RGBI
display is best. Ordinary TV output is
totally unsuitable and composite video
can be as bad. Not that these options are
available. If you select 80-column mode
the output switches automatically to the
RGBI socket.
Put simply, composite video means
that the picture information is sent out
as a  single signal. From this coded
message the monitor sorts out the red
component fr om the blue and the
green. This information is then relayed
to t h e  appropriate picture forming
'guns' deep inside the monitor and then
on to the screen.
BF signals ar e simply composite
signals mixed together with the sound
output. Then the whole mixture is
whacked up to a Radio Frequency to
which the aerial socket on a TV will
respond. The whole process is then
reversed. The signal brought down to its
original level, the sound sifted out and
the colours separated. This obviously
involves more stages than utilising a
composite signal and the more stages
the signal is put through, the more it is
degraded.
RGBI on the other hand sends out its
signal in the three colours separately
(hence the RGB of its name). This means
fewer stages ar e needed than was
required for even the composite signal
and therefore the image is sharper and
clearer.
The disadvantage of a mixed RGBI
80-column mode and a composite 40-
column mode is that it is awkward to
switch from one mode to the other, Each
screen works independently o f  the
other a n d  s c r een h a n d l i n g  i s
complicated. Fortunately there is a way
to display the big screen on a composite
monitor and Robtek and Horasoft are
marketing adaptors for around 03. They
are just simple cross-over switches and
the price you pay is the loss of colour in
80-column mode. DIY enthusiasts may
be interested in the little diagram which
shows the necessary wiring.
With the 128, Commodore has taken
up a posture astride the twilight zone
between home and business computing
but with a ﬁrm footing on either side.
With the computer industry uncertain
which way computers will go, the 128 is a
good way to hedge your bet.

WORDpROCESSINg
Stuart Cooke analyses three
C128 wordprocessing
packages and gives his
jecommendations.
ONE OF THE MAIN 'SERIOUS USLS OF
a computer is as a wordprocessor. Some
companies have made a fortune selling
dedicated word processing systems. The
only difference between these and your
Commodore 128 is that the dedicated
machines have a wordprocessor built
into the machine while the C128 must
load one from disk or tape, obviously
this makes the C128 much more versatile
since you could use it for lots of different
applications.
So exactly what is a wordprocessor?
Well to put it in simple terms, a word-
processor is just a gloriﬁed typewriter.
Instead of typing your text, be it a letter
or a chapter from a book, on to a piece
of paper, you type it into your computer.
Once your text is in your computer's
memory you can read it through, correct
any spellings_ make any other alterations
such as moving paragraphs around and
eventually, when you're satisﬁed, print it
out on to your computer printer.
Obviously the quality of your print-
out depends upon the type of printer
that you have attached to your C128. If
you only have a very cheap dot-matrix
printer yo u  can't expect t o  get
typewriter quality. If you have a high
quality laser printer hooked up to your
machine you can print pages that are as
good as a printed page. In other words
'you get what you pay for'.
Obviously if you have a printer, a
wordprocessor is a must, you can use it
to write your latest novel or simply a
thank you letter to an aunt al Christmas.
If your handwriting is as bad as mine
everyone else will probably be pleased
that you bought a wordprocessor.
So what is available for the C128?
Three companies h ave launched
packages in Britain. These are Precision
Software, with an updated version of
SuperScript wordprocessor so that it
works on the C128. Vita Software has
launched Visa Classic again which is an
update of an earlier C64 program. The
third company is a newcomer to the
English market, although extremely well
known t o  the States, Timeworks is
launching Word Writ or 128.

All of the programs come complete
with a spelling checker. Once your text
has been written, run this option and the
program will compare all words in the
text against those held in its dictionary.
Obviously they can't correct your
spellings but they do highlight any
words that they ﬁnd unfamiliar so that
you can check them in a normal diction-
ary. You can even add words to the
dictionary so that the program will
'know' the words the next time they
come up.
Viza Classic
Viza Classic can only be described as the
'prettiest' program of  the bunch. It
works only in 80 columns, so TV owners
will not be able to use it without an
interface, even so it would probably be
very difﬁcult to read the text.
The program disk is a 'ﬂippy' (has
programs on both sides) and has the
wordprocessor on one side of the disk
and the dictionary on the other. The disk
is easily copied so you need not worry
about having to use your master disk all
of the time. Viza Classic is however still
protected as it will not run without the
necessary cartridge plugged into the
back of the computer, and of course you
only get one of these. This is the way that
all expensive software should be. After
all if you spill coffee on a [100 disk it is
difﬁcult to replace. If it is only a copy of
the disk and the protection is elsewhere
you are a lot better off since you can
soon make another copy of the master
disk.
61
When running, the program displays
all of your text within a border and the
available commands are accessed by a
series of pull down menus across the top
of the screen.
Many extremely useful options are
available. For a start you can see at a
glance exactly how many words, sen-
tences an d  paragraphs yo u  have
entered. This is essential for journalists
who must write to a certain length. Also
available is a calculator which also has
the ability to perform calculations on
columns within the text.
You can  use data f rom other
programs such as Viza's own Viza Classic
database and spread sheet or you can
load in data from other wordprocessors.
Basic programs obviously can't b e
loaded in to the wordprocessor since
they are tokenised. If, however, you
really want to wordprocess a program
you can always list it  t o  disk as a
sequential ﬁle and then LOAD it in.
Listing programs leads m e quite
nicely into getting printouts from the
,
there are a number of options available
to aid with the formatting of text. These
range from underlining and centering
text to indenting columns of text so that
any tables are printed out neatly.
All these functions are accessed from
a combination of the CONTROL key and
a letter. This is where Viza Classic has
one of its very few bad points_ There is
no indication on the screen as to what
keys you should press to get at a speciﬁc
function. If you can't remember, then
two options are open to you, either

ﬁ
Cll 2 8
place your Viza Classic disk in the drive
and press the help key. The help ﬁles will
then be loaded from disk without af-
fecting your text. The other option is to
refer to your manual. Obviously you
soon learn the commands that you use a
lot but the ones that you don't often
need have to be looked up.
When y o u  c ome t o  t h e  actual
printout y o u  hav e many  options
available to you. For a start you can
deﬁne what sort of printer you are using
so that t h e  program knows whic h
commands to send to the printer for a
speciﬁc effect e.g. underline. You can
say whether y ou want headers and
footers, these have their own pages in
memory so they can be a number of
lines long. If you have a printer that can
cope with graphics such as an Epson, Star
or a Commodore MPS801 you even have
the option of using one of three inbuilt,
proportionally spaced, Near Letter
Quality fonts.
You can force the program to make
sure that paragraphs are not split over
pages with the paginate command and
you can change the width and length of
the paper or the number of lines to a
page etc.
One area i n  which I  found the
manual lacking was an explanation of
the NIQ fonts. Ok, so it explained how to
use them but I could have done with
knowing the size i.e. number of lines per
page and number of  characters per
column since I wasted a lot of paper
before I got it right.
As with Viza's program the available
commands can be seen at the top of the
screen, this time however all commands
can be selected from here as well as by
pressing keys. This means that you don't
have to worry about remembering the
commands as a quick look through the
relevant menu will ﬁnd it for you. As you
would expect, there are numerous com-
mands available to you. Again we have a
maths function which will perform cal-
culations within the document as well as
the normal print format commands. If you
normal print format commands. If you
have ever used Superscript on the C64 or
even the earlier Easyscript you will feel at
home with Superscript since there is
very little difference between t h e
programs.
If you don't have a Commodore
printer don't worry, as with the previous
program you can set up the printer to
suit your own requirements, including
Centronics and RS232 printers.
Again the supplied disk is a ﬂippy
with the program on one side and the
dictionary on the other. Unlike Viza
Classic you can't copy the program
though you can get a backup copy when
you send off your registration form.
One extremely handy feature of this
program is the ability to have both this
program a n d  Precision's data base
program, Superbase, in memory at the
same time. Press a few keys and you're in
the relevant program. This is superb if
you have a large address list, such as the
one used by Your Commodore, zv, you

1Other Important kess isellvdt:
Obviously I don't have enough room
here to mention all of the features of this
wordprocessor and there are many that I
haven't even launched upon. all I can
really add is that even though it may
seem a little pricey and I do have a few
gripes it is a real joy to use and i
wouldn't be without it.
Superscript
Unlike %ilia Classic, Superscript allows
you to use either 40 or 80 columns thus
making it  an ideal choice for C128
owners who are using either a TV or one
of the older 40 column Commodore
monitors.
can simply pull the relevant information,
name, address etc., into your text ﬁle.
Other programs do allow you to do this
but having both programs in memory at
the same time is a great time saver, not to
mention very handy.
Superscript comes complete with an
extremely hefty manual. Every bit of
information that you could want is easily
found f r o m a  very comprehensive
index. Don't let the size put you off
however as the program is very simple to
use and the ﬁrst few paragraphs are in
the form of a very easy tutorial that will
help to get you started.
Many people say that Superscript is
the best word processor for the C64. On
62
the C128 it may not look as 'pretty' as
Viza Classic but it does have points in its
favour -  for example, the 40 column
mode and the fact that all commands are
available from the menu. Superscript is a
very easy to use and comprehensive
program.
Word Writer 128
This program is similar to Viza Classic
since all of the commands are selected
from p u ll dow n menus. Since this
package is far cheaper than the Viza one,
a number of the 'extras' that are avail-
able with the more expensive package
are missing. Even so this package is very
easy to use and has all of the facilities
that most people would want from a
word processor.
Unlike Superscript, Word Writer 128
does expect you to select some of the
commands by pressing keys rather than
from the menu. However, a HELP ﬁle is
always available to show you what these
keys are. Unlike Viza Classic this ﬁle is
resident with the program and doesn't
need to access the disk.
It seems to have become the norm
with C128 wordprocessors that all of
them have an inbuilt calculator. Unlike
the calculator in the other programs this
one will not allow y ou t o  perform
calculations on numbers in the text.
Instead a l l  calculations mus t b e
performed manually. The result of the
last calculation can be copied into the
document.
The version sent to the magazine for
review was the American one complete
with American dictionaries f o r  t he
spelling checker. Don't let this worry
you as the version that is going to be on
sale here will come complete with an
English dictionary.
As with both of the previous word-
processors, provision is  made f o r
mailing list operations. This means that
you can set up a ﬁle of names and
addresses on disk and merge them in
with a standard letter.
Files from Timework's spreadsheet
program, Swittcalc 728, can be merged
into a document so that you can print
out reports from any spreadsheets that
you may use.
Information from Timework's data-
base program Data Manager 128 can also
be included within documents. You can
even use an address ﬁle from your data-
base as a mailing list for your letters.
Wordwriter is a very clear and easy to
use program. It has all of the standard
wordprocessor functions such as margin
setting, lin e  spacing alteration and
changing the type style, but it does lack
some of the more 'complex' features of
the other  t w o  programs. I f  you're
looking f o r  a  reasonably pr ic ed
Wordprocessor that is easy to use then
this may be ideal for you.

COMMODORE 128
Advanced Programming
The Commodore 128 can
be used in three separate
modes. the 128K mode is
particularly attrivtive to the
serious Computer user, This
book is intended for the owner
who already knows the
elements of programming in
BASIC, and who wants to make
the Commodore 128 work for
its living. Because the BASIC of
the 128 is so much superior to
that of the older C64 model,
much more can be
accomplished without
knowledge of machine-code,
and this book fully stretches
the abilities of the new BASIC
The focal point of each chapter
is the application of BASIC
subroutines to data
processing. and to that end
many very useful and original subroutines are included You will learn,
tor example, how to work with pointers in BASIC. and how to speed up a
string sort by the use of pointers to array members.
Whether your interest is for business or pleasure, hobby or proﬁt,
Ibis is a book that will reward your reading and bring new perspective to

Stuart Cooke ties up loose'
ends in  our C128 Roundup'
special.
EVEN THOUGH THE COMMODORE
128 is an excellent choice as a machine
for a small business, it's not only business
people who will buy it. It is an ideal
machine for  learning o n  o r  simply
upgrading to from a C64. The advanced
Basic in 128 mode is helpful to beginners
and has been improved dramatically
from the C64. Now it has graphics, sound
and toolkit commands.
Obviously one Of he best ways to
learn about a computer is to read up on
it, 128 users are extremely well catered
for.
First Publishing, true to form, has
produced a series of technical books, as
they did for the C64 and have done for
many other computers. Three books are
available and it would be fair to say that
no Commodore 128 owner should be
without any of them. The three books in
question ar e 'The Anatomy o f  the
Commodore 128', w hic h giv es  a
c omplet e b r e a k d o w n  o f  t h e
Commodore 128's internal hardware at a
very deep level. 'Hints and Tips for the
C128' gives many handy hints as well as a
large number of programs for your own
use and ﬁnally 'The Anatomy of the 1571'
gives a  complete breakdown o f  the
workings in Commodore's latest disk
drive. The 1571 is built into the 128D.
Beginers beware, these books are very
technical and trying t o  read them
knowing nothing about computers
would probably put you off computing
for life. On the other hand if you want to
program y our C128 you'll soon b e
referring to them as your Bible.
There a r e  book s  available f o r
beginners so you needn't worry if you're
new t o  computers. 'Starting Basic,
Commodore 128 book 1' is a useful little
tome from Glentop Computer Books. It
is principally a replacement for the Basic
section of the 128 manual and is far
superior t o  it. The book  is  full o f
programming examples and illustrations
to help you on your way and is deﬁnitely
recommended to anyone who wishes to
learn about their machine.
SAMS has produced a couple of C128
books, they are both available in the UK
from Pitman Publishing. The ﬁrst book is
the 'Ofﬁcial Book for the Commodore
128 Personal Computer' which, lik e
Glentop's book is an introduction to the
machine and how to use it, though it
does n't g o  v e r y  d e e p l y  i n t o
programming. I  he lates t b o o k
'Commodore 128 Reference Guide For
Programmers' is quite a lot better. It is
not, as its title would suggest, a technical
book for programmers but, as with the
Glentop, is more of a re-write of the
manual. Even so, it is extremely well
written and a n  ideal choice as  a
beginner's book, or even for an expert,
as an invaluable reference guide, and it's
so much better than the manual!
More advanced programmers will be

pleased to ﬁnd complete breakdowns of
the machine's memory maps, including
entry points to many useful machine
code routines. I must say that it isn't as
technical or as informative as the First
Publishing books but is deﬁnitely a good
all rounder.
All In Machine Code
At the recent Commodore Show I was
asked ii we had heard of any assemblers
64
for the Commodore 128. At that time we
hadn't c ome across any  that wer e
commercially available though we did
print a superb assembler by Steve Carrie
in t h e  J uly  1986 issue o f  Yo u r
Commodore. Since then Commodore
have launc hed a n  Assembler and
Program Development System. This is a
suite of programs available on disk for all
Commodore machines, all on the same
disk. Depending o n  t h e  machine,
different functions are available. For
•

example, the C64 version has a monitor
but since the C128 has one built into the
machine there is no point in having
another one. T he Assembler offers
nothing out of the ordinary but it does
work well. If you are used to macros and
other such fancy bits then I'm afraid that
you may be a little disappointed.
Many of the functions available with
the editor can also be used with Basic.
For example moving the cursor to the
top of the screen and pressing cursor up

will display the previous line of any
listing on the screen, i.e. you now have
bi-directional scrolling. A Search and
Replace function is  also avalable in
Basic, one of the few that I have come
across for Basic routines and extremely
useful.
The manual is quite clear but if you
have never touched machine c ode
before then you will need to read up on
it ﬁrst because the manual doesn't try to
teach you.
If you want an assembler for your 128
then this package is  one that y ou
shouldn't be without.
For those of you who want the speed
of machine c ode b u t  without t h e
inconvenience o f  learning another
language, First Publishing has come to
your aid with their Basic Compiler: Basic
128.
Basic 128 is an updated version of
their CM compiler. It understands all of
the C128 Basic commands and will turn
most programs in t o  machine c ode
without t o o  many  problems. This
package is  extremely powerful and
allows you to produce either integer
programs for speed or ﬂoating point
programs if you need to use a lot of
numerical data in your program.
Basic 128 would be an excellent and
welcome addition to any C128 software
collection.

Late Arrival
Commodore has just released a suite of
programs f o r  t h e  C128 f o r  small
businesses. The programs, called Micro
Cler, comprise o f  a  worldprocessor,
database, spreadsheet, accounting
package and lots more.
First impressions ar e extremely
favourable, t h e  pr ogr am i s  f u lly
integrated with many sections being in
memory all of the time. You always have
jotters available at the press of a function
key, you can leave phone numbers or
messages on these. A convenient diary
function will allow you to keep track of
appointments, birthdays etc. all at the
touch of another button. All in all, Micro
Clerk should make most of your other
software obsolete.
I don't think it would be unfair to say
that this is the type of package that
Commodore should give away with the
C128 computer. Other manufacturers
have done i t  and have reaped vast
rewards thereby. For a full review of this
unbeatable package you will have to
wait until next month.
More?
In this small series of articles I have tried
to mention all of the packages that we
have seen in  the Your Commodore
ofﬁce. I would hope that there are many
more out there to fulﬁl the growing
demand for software on this machine. If
YOU do know of something or you are
producing something do let us know
about it, we would love to cover it in a
future issue.

reconﬁgure
£64. 
d

 11111-
ONCE YOU START DIGGING,
it soon becomes apparent
that t h e  C64 is  a  highly
versatile machine. The Vic
chip is particularly cunning in
its ability to address any part
of R A M  f o r  t h e  screen
memory and character set.
Machine code users won't
be too concerned about this
but for  Basic users, it's  a
godsend. The way in which
the machine decides on the
memory us age i s  q u i t e
simple.
Firstly, the RAM is split
into four banks of 16K. The
particular bank  i n  us e is
speciﬁed by the lowest two
bits of location 56576.
The position of the screen
memory and character set
within the current bank are
speciﬁed by bits four to seven
and bits one t o  three o f
location 53272, respectively.
Within constraints, manipu-
lation of these two locations
allows y ou t o  change the
conﬁguration of the 64 to suit
your needs.
Why Bother?
Why r e c o n ﬁg u r e  t h e
machine? The main reason is
that you may want t o  use
redeﬁned characters. if you
use Basic, however, you will
want t o  max imis e t h e
memory available t o  Basic.
The simple demonstrations in
the Programmer's Reference
Guide use the default bank
with the characters starting at
12288 ($3000). This leaves you
a pathetic 10K for Basic and
minimal space f o r  sprites.
With a bit of thought, as I will
show, you can have redeﬁned
characters with n o  loss o f
memory!
So where can we move the
screen a n d  c h a r a c t e r
memories? T h e  character
memory requires 2K and the
screen needs1K. That means
that in each bank there are
eight positions fo r  th e
character set and 16 positions
for the screen. The limitations
are as follows.

The machine uses this bank
by default w ith the video
memory at 1024 ($0400) and
the character set image from
4096 to 8191 ($1000 to $1FFF).
1) You cannot use the zero
page and page one since this
will corrupt t h e  operating
system.
2) The use of this bank will
generally severely limit your
RAM for Basic and is therefore
of little value. You could use a
character set at 14336 ($3800)
if you're prepared to live with
only 12K for your program.
3) You may not use 4096 to
8191 ($1000 t o  $1 FFF) f o r
screen memory since this is
the character set image.
Bank 1 ($4000-$7M)
You can use all of this bank
but my earlier comments on
reduced RAM apply.
Bank 2 ($8000-$BFFF)
1) There is  a  character set
image between 36864 and
40959 ($9000 to $9FFF). This
area may not be used for
screen memory.
2) The Basic ROM occupies
40960 t o  49151 (SA000 t o
$C000) precluding the use of
this area for either screen or
characters. It can, however,
be used for high resolution
graphics or sprite designs.
Bank 3 ($C000-SFFFF)
1) The area 49152 to 53247
(SC000 to SU M  may be used
for screen memor y  a n d
characters.
2) The ar ea f r o m  52448
($D000) is occupied by the
Kernal ROM and other chips
and is of limited value. The
ROM area ($E000 onwards
may b e  us ed f o r  h i g h
resolution graphics or sprites
only.
If you use banks 0, 1 or 2
you must remember to lower
the top of memory to protect
your screen o r  characters
from corruption b y  Basic
variables. If your screen or
characters (whichever t h e
lower) starts at address AD,
you may protect them by the
line;
POKE 56,AD/256: CLR
The area between t h e
ROMS in bank 3 is the perfect
area t o  use. This memory
cannot be corrupted by Basic

and leaves you with all the
Basic memory you have on
power-up. If you want to be
clever, s inc e t h e  nor mal
screen m e m o r y  i s  n o w
unused, you can lower the
start of Basic to 1025 ($0400)
leaving you nearly 40K for
Basic usage! If you want to use
this area in bank 3, you can
put the screen at:
$C000 (49152),
$C400 (50176),
$C000 (51200), or
SC A00 (52224)
and the characters at:
$C000 (49152), or
SCA00 (52224)
One extra warning, don't
try t o  put the screen and
character memories in  the
same place, it  won't work
properly I
The program
The listing generates a short
program which will recon-
ﬁgure the 64 for you, You tell
it where you want the screen
and character memories and
it generates a short machine
code program and auto-
matically saves it to disk or
cassette. The creation of the
program involves destroying
the original program so make
sure that you:
1) Type it in exactly as listed.
2) Don't try to stop it during
its execution.
To r ec onﬁgur e y o u r
machine, simply load t h e
machine code routine and
RUN it. If you list it, you will
see that it has just one line of
Basic. Once the machine is
reconﬁgured, you will get a
reassuring message o n the
screen.
What the program actually
does is:
1) C opies  t h e  n o r m a l
fuppercase) character set to
the new character area, and
2) Resets t h e  bank  a n d
memory areas as required.
The pr ogr am contains
some prompting to help you
remember what is allowed,
n d it will prevent the more
fundamental blunders. Nor
will it stop you from using an
illegal area of memory so be
careful,

go at something different,
how about a crossword?
This p r o g r a m  c omes
complete with a suite of four
crosswords for you to try and
solve. In a future issue we will
be printing more crosswords
and giving details of how to
enter your own.
Crossword displays a
standard grid on the screen
and each c lue is  scrolled

answer on to grid.
RETURN - Enter answer onto
grid and display next clue.
Getting It All In
Crossword is presented as a
set of two Basic loaders. The
ﬁrst set, 'CROSS LOAD' will
set up and save a machine
c ode p r o g r a m  c a l l e d
CROSSWORD on to tape or
disk. This is the program that
you should always RUN when
you want to use the program.
Before y o u  R U N  t h e
CROSS LOAD programs you
70
should enter the following
command:
POKE 434:POKE 44,30:.POKE
7679.0:NEW
This will move Basic so that
the CROSSWORD program
will be generated correctly_
The second set of loaders,
ACROSS LOAD' will set up
the questions on either disk
or tape. Before you RUN this
set of programs switch your
machine OFF and ON. When
RUN, this set of loaders will
create a ﬁle called ACROSS'
on disk or tape. You will not
be able to list this program as

the data ﬁle which you have
created. At the moment this is
ACROSS'. After loading you
will be asked for which of the
four crosswords that you wish
to use.
Because of ihe length of this

Aduenture Aid
Alien Webb shows
I
to your adventure
programs.
MANY PEOPLE WH O  BE-
come addicted to program-
ming their home computers,
enjoy the challenge of writing
their own adventure games.
This is all very well, but one
area where you may have
trouble is in providing the
graphics which will enhance
your ﬁnished work. This
program will do just that.
It is designed to comple-
ment t h e  Adventure aid
program which appeared in
Your Commodore, May '86.
The problem with using
graphics in adventures is that
there is an inevitable conﬂict
for memory. Since graphics
are memory hungry, their use
needs a degree of cunning.
There are a number of ways of
implementing them.
1. Use of high resolution bit
mapping. This is particularly
demanding on memory with
a full screen requiring 8K of
RAM.
There are a  number of
ways of using this system.
Firstly, pictures can b e
loaded direct from storage.
This, however, is only suitable
for disk based systems.
Alternatively, yo u  can
draw the picture using simple
drawing an d  ﬁlling com-
mands. This tends t o give
pictures of limited complexity
but works quite well. Another
way is to store high resolution
pictures in RAM using data
compression.
2. Use redeﬁned characters.
There is a minimum overhead
of 1024 bytes per character
set, but with interrupts or fast
data moving you can use
several character sets. You
must, however, develop a
system of encoding pictures
in a memory efﬁcient way.
This method is not used that
frequently with commercial
adventures (Taskset's Souls of
Darkon is a n  exception).
Arcade adventures however,
rarely use anything else_
3. Use sprites. This method
has a number of bonuses and
is the method I've chosen.
C64 Painter
This package uses a block of
sprites -  four wide by two
high - to provide a rectangu-
lar picture. This has a memory
overhead of 512 bytes plus 512
bytes per picture. The system
also saves the colours giving a
further 10 bytes overhead per
picture. The virtues of the
system are:
1. Yo u  can  position t h e
picture anywhere on screen.
2. You can use sprite expan-
sion to give pictures of four
sizes.
3. The range of colours is
wide: Each basic sprite has
three colours plus the back-
ground colour; t h e back-
ground co l o u r c a n  b e
extended by placing charac-
ters behind the sprite - these
can be reverse spaces or other
shadings to give textures.
Overall, t h e theoretical
maximum number of colours
in any given sprite square is 16
(assuming fully expandable
sprites).
4. You don't need interrupts
to mix text and pictures.
5. The resolution is the same
as bit mapped mode.
As I explained, the picture
comprises of a block of eight
sprites offering a resolution of
96 points horizontally and 42
points vertically. The code
allows you t o  create and
manipulate pictures.
78
I plan to show you how to
generate pictures using two
methods:
1. By recalling pre-drawn pic-
tures as blocks of data from
RAM.
2. Using a  sequence o f
commands t o  d raw  t h e
picture as you need it.
Since the code is rather
large, the article will be in two
parts. This part introduces the
code and tells you how to use
it. Next time I will give two
editors and describe their
use.
How it Works
First, let  m e describe the
code. The machine code is
loaded i n  t h e usual w ay
(Listing 1) and starts at $7800,
The loader automatically
drops the top of  Basic to
protect t h e  co d e. T h e
commands offered are listed
in Table 1.
These commands need a
little more explanation.
Command 1 initialises the
picture and puts it on the
screen. All sprites are set to
colour -  COL -  and TYPE
speciﬁes the type of picture
i.e. 0=Highres and lz--multi-
colour. XEX and YEX specify
whether or not the picture is
expanded -  1
0=contracted. X and Y are the
co-ordinates of the top left
corner of the picture.
Command 2 sets up the
individual sprite colours.
Command 3 speciﬁes the
multicolour registers and the
background colour.
Command 4  ﬁlls t h e
picture with a speciﬁed byte.
A value of zero clears the
screen.
Command 5 changes a dot
at position X and Y in a high
resolution picture. FLAG
decides h o w  t h e  d o t  i s
changed:
0 - erases the point
1 -  sets the point
2 - ﬂips the point
Y is in the range zero to 41 and
X in the range zero to 95.
Command 6 turns off the
picture.
Command 7  draws a
multicolour dot at X.Y. Y is in
the range zero to 41 and X in
the range zero to 47 (don't
forget that a multicolour dot
is twice the width of a high
resolution dot). T h e p en
speciﬁes the colour:
0 - background colour
1 -  colour register 1 (Cl)
2 - the sprite colour as spec-
iﬁed in commands 1 or 2
3 - colour register 2 (C3)
Command 8  ﬂips t h e
picture.
Command 9 draws a high
resolution line according to
FLAG between X1,Y1 an d
X2,Y2. The resolution and
FLAG values a r e  a s  f o r
command 5  except that
values of four and ﬁve give
dotted lines. A value of four
starts the line with a dot and
the value ﬁve starts it with a
space. In multicolour mode,
this command draws a multi-
colour line with the same X
range as high resolution and
the p en  value i s  as f o r
command 7. This allows the
use of the same coding in
either mode, 
•
Command 10 is included
to give compatability with
command 7. It is identical to
command 9  in multicolour
mode but uses an X value in
the range zero to 47. This is
clearly more correct than
zero to 95.
Command 11 moves the
picture to an area of RAM.
This is stored as 512 bytes
followed by 10 bytes holding
the colour data. You can use
any RAM except for the lower
portion below 2049. The area
behind t h e  R O M s  i s
particularly handy.

current picture according to a
,peciﬁed rule:
0-AND
1 - OR
2 - .EOR
The colour registers are not
'nvolved in this command.
Command 14 saves a block
,)f RAM between addresses
and EA to disk or cassette
'depending o n DEV). Only
the area up to SCHF can be
,aveci.
Command 1 5  tells  t h e
machine which sprites to use.
Commands 16 and 17 draw
a random pattern of dots as
trom an airbrush. Command
16 uses high resolution mode
and command 17 uses multi-
olour, The pattern occupies
a rectangle with its top left
corner at position X and Y.
DENSITY has a value from one
to 255 and decides how many
dots are drawn in this rect-
angle. SIZE speciﬁes the size
.3f the rectangle and has the
alues zero for small, one for
medium and two for large.
FLAG a n d  PEN  a c t  a s
described before for the Dot
commands.
Commands 18 and 19 draw
ﬁlled rectangles. The top left
corner is speciﬁed by X1,Y1
and the bottom right corner
by X2,Y2. FLAG and PEN are as
for the line commands. FLAG
set to four, for example, will
draw a stripey square. FLAG
set t o  t w o  w i l l  ﬂi p  a
rectangular area.
Commands 20 and 21 draw
triangular shapes, X1 and Y1
specify the position o f  the
apex. X2 and Y2 specify the
bottom left corner. The main
constraint is  that the base
must be horizontal and the
bottom right corner is there-
fore speciﬁed by X3 and Y2.
Command 2 1  draws a
sequence of shapes.
You will have noticed that
the scaling is  different for
high resolution and multi
colour modes, In high resol-
ution modes, the routines
ensure that X values remain in
the range zero to 95. In multi-
colour mode, X values are
kept in the range zero to 47.
In both modes, Y remains in

the range zero t o 41. The
error trapping means that if
you t r y  t o  exceed these
ranges, you will simply get a
dot at the maximum value. If,
for example, you try to plot a
dot at X=100 and Y=100 in high
resolution mode, you will get
a dot at X=95 and Y=10.
In order to give you maxi-
mum ﬂexibility, I have written
the code to act on any sprite
positions. All you need to do
is tell it the position of the
sprite pointer s  a n d  t h e
starting pos ition o f  t h e
picture (using command 15).
As I will show in the next part,
the most effective way o f
using this system is to raise the
start o f  Basic and use the
block starting at sprite 32 in
the default block with the
screen at the normal location.
The sprite pointers therefore
start at 2040 and command 15
has the form:
SYS SA+42,2040,32
You m u s t  u s e  t h i s
command before you use any
other commands otherwise
you will probably corrupt the
machine and cause a crash.
The picture comprises of a
block of sprites starting at a
speciﬁed position. I n  t h e
above situation, the picture
occupies sprites 32 through to
39 inclusive. Consider this to
be your display area. You can
use RAM as a scratch pad to
save and recall designs to the
display area using commands
11 and 12. If you were using
this system in an adventure,
you would have the pictures
stored in RAM as a series of
522 byte blocks. You could
then us e command 12 t o
display them at will.

Demonstrations
DEMO 1 shows brieﬂy what
the commands can do.
The sequence command is
a way  o f  saving drawing
instructions as a sequence of
numbers. T h e  instruction
runs through the data starting
at the speciﬁed address and
executes t h e  instructions
until the number 255 is met.
All commands have the same
form. The ﬁrst number in a
sequence identiﬁes the in-
struction and this is followed
by the required parameters.
The supported commands
are:

These codes are followed by
the requisite parameters as
speciﬁed in  the commands
given earlier. Here are some
examples:
To draw a line in high res-
olution mode fr om 0,0 t o
30,30, the byte sequence is:
6.0,0,30,30,1
To set up a full size, multi-
colour picture at 90,50 with all
sprites set to red, the byte
sequence is:
0.90,50,2,1,1,1
DEMO 2 shows how this
works. The data statements
hold eac h c ommand s e-
quence and these are POKEd
inc ons is tent. A l l  h i g h
resolution mode commands
act as before. Multicolour
commands use the same zero
to 95 range for X but must start
using an even value for X. If
you think about it, it's obvious
since each bit pair starts on an
even number.
The square and triangle
commands require that you
set the X2 and X3 co-ordinates
respectively are set t o one
higher than you need. Again
this is because the sequence
command bypasses the user-
friendly  i n p u t s  t o  t h e
commands. Finally, you must
ensure that the airbrush area
does not overlap the top
bounds of the window. If the
top l e f t  c or ner  o f  t h e
brush area is at X,Y then you
must ensure that (X+WI)<96
and (Y-s-H1) <42 where WI and
HI are as in Table 2.

sequentially in t o  t h e  area
starting at 53000. A single SYS
call is then all that is needed
to draw the picture.
If you use the sequence
command y o u  m u s t  b e
careful since ther e is  n o
protection offered b y  t h e
error detection. Additionally,
apart fr om t he multibrush
routine, a l l  mu lt ic o lo u r
scaling is removed. In fact,
scaling gets a little messy and
In or der  t o  make t h e
sequence command operate
as quickly as  possible, i t
expects a sequence less than
254 bytes in length. This is no
hardship since you can use
any number of sequences to
draw a picture.
Don't worry if  all these
restrictions appear to compli-
cate life, next time I'll provide
an editor which will take care
of everything for you.

Evelyn Mills has been A I
doodling with a new
graphics package.
THE 3D GRAPHICS DRAWING BOARD
is, a recent addition t o the growing
collection of graphics software for the
C64 and 128 and is a deﬁnite must for
those interested in geometric design.
Using this program you can create 3D
images on the screen using either cursor
or joystick control; these images can be
altered with the commands available in
so many ways that there is ample scope
for your imagination.
The drawings which you create can
be saved individually to disk, or as sub-
parts which may then be linked t o
existing designs at a later date. All draw-
ings can likewise be saved to the Koala
Printer by an independent icon, thus
leaving you with plenty of scope to use
the full facilities of this software. The 3D
Graphics Board however, is excellent in
every way as a stand alone program.
Try Your Hand
How does it work? O n loading and
running, a very well designed 3D Main
Menu is displayed with 25 options avail-
able. Let us assume that you choose a
cylinder from these options using any
number of sides from three to 50. A press
of the F13 (or space bar) leads to the
Secondary M e n u  w it h  1 2  options.
Choose the pencil mode to draw, select
three points as instructed and, in a
matter of seconds there is your cylinder.
Now you may rotate, move, enlarge,
reduce, twist, turn, stretch, extend,
rescale, copy, change viewing angle and
much more. A  veritable arsenal o f
commands is there for your use and
everything moves very smoothly and
with commendable speed. Whatever
you choose to do is visible on the screen
as y ou manipulate t h e  commands.
When you are happy with the result,
press the FB or equivalent space bar and
your drawing is complete. You may, of
course add further designs t o  t h e
existing one.
Basically you have a cube, a pyramid
and a cylinder with which to work.
Correct rotation of the cylinder will give
circles or ovals. There is, of course, free
hand drawing by various means and, for
exact drawing, co-ordinates are listed at
the bottom of the screen so that a design
may be constructed accurately; this is
particularly useful for architectural and
perspective draughtmanship.
Co-ordinates are also shown for most
of the other features which help you to
keep track of what you have been doing.
Erasure facilities are, o f  course,
available -  for total erasure, line/lines
erasure and sub-part erasure. Files may
likewise be erased.
86
1
Both the Main Menu and the Sec-
ondary Menu are freely interchangeable
and the permutations and combinations
of such interchanges are virtually in-
ﬁnite. This is extended even more by the
ability to add previously saved sub-parts
to existing drawings (remembering
screen limitations!),
A demo is included on the disk which
is intended t o  show y ou h o w  the
program works, This is not a display of.
graphics as such but is a teaching facility
which highlights each icon as it is used,
showing the result on screen.
The all important manual explains
everything in a well deﬁned manner,
providing a printed display of each icon,
a description of how it works and several
programs you try. There are certainly no
problems here and, on the ﬁnal page,
there is a display of the Main Menu in
'Basic English' which is a great help for
quick reference.
The printer output is for the MPS801
or 802 and can be in normal or enlarged
size.
Having enthused s o muc h there
remains little to say except that this is a
very welcome and innovative addition
to the world of 3D computer graphics on
the C64/128.

COMMODORE
This month we introduce a
new regular. Eric Doyle sorts
out the most common
technical problems which
confuse many Commodore
owners.
SLIPPING A  CASSETTE I N T O  A
recorder and saving a program is easy.
Buy a disk drive and you move into a
totally n e w  env ironment. Tracks,
sectors, driv e numbers and device
numbers are just a few of the new terIns
which have t o  be coped with and
mastered. The manual tries to be concise
but usually succeeds in being confusing.
The next few paragraphs will not turn
you into an expert but it should help you
to get acquainted with the essentials.
To d is p e l t h e  d r iv e  n u m b e r
confusion, let me explain. Many years
ago when home computers were just a
glimmer in Sir Clive's eyes, Commodore
was a major force in the business world
and the PET machines used single and
twin disk units. A twin or dual disk drive
had to be able to differentiate between
its two drive units, so one was christened
drive 0 and the other was named drivel.
When the goold old Vic 20 came along
the new Vic 1540 drives were single
units, all numbered drive a  The DOS
(Disk Operating System) stored inside
the machine was based on the older dual
drive system (only Commodore knows
why) so a drive number will still have to
be allocated even though this was always
O.
The new drives shared the serial DIN
socket w i t h  pr inter s  a n d  o t h e r
peripherals. So that the computer knew
which of these devices it was talking to,
each peripheral was given a  device
or
number. This is rather like a phone
number o n  an international dialling
system. It's not enough just to call upthe
correct number, you must also speak the
correct language for the peripheral on
the other end to understand what you
want.
Most books also take great pains to
explain about tracks and sectors. For the
majority of users this is not essential
knowledge, all you need to know is that
disk drives store information i n  a
speciﬁc, ﬁxed format.
A 5.25 inch disk could be used on one
of a  range o f  disk drives and each
manufacturer uses a different storage
format. To tell the disk that it is now to
behave as a Commodore disk it has to be
formatted. The action of formatting also
allows you to give the disk a name of
your o w n  c hoos ing. T h e  o l d e r
Commodore 64 and Vic 20 do not have
any disk commands but, since the
launch of the C-16 and Plus/4, this area
has become part of the standard set of
commands. Format commands look like
this:
Vic 20/C64
PRINT #  15,"NO:diskname,id"
or
PRINT #  15."N:diskname,id"
C
HEADER"diskname",D0.1id,ON U8
813
HEADER''diskname",D0,1id
C128
HEADER"diskname",lid,D0,0N U8
or
HEADER"diskname",lid
Before using the Vic 20/C64 commands
you mus t ﬁrs t o p e n  a  ﬁle  w it h
OPEN15,8,15. Where the ﬁrst 15 is just a
ﬁle number and could have any value
from one to 255, the eight is the disk's
device number and the last 15 is the
number which tells the computer to go
into command mode.
This form of command would work
equally well with any of the other,three
machines but in all cases the whole
operation must be ended with CLOSE 15
after the formatting command has been
despatched.
The disk name can be any name you
fancy as long as two rules are followed.
Firstly, the name must be no more than
16 characters long and, secondly, you
must avoid using certain characters. A
good practice is only to use letters of the
alphabet or numbers for ﬁle names.
The 'id' (identiﬁer) is the disk's real
name and, as i n  t h e  case o f  t he
diskname, the two characters of the id
must be alphanumeric. It doesn't matter
if two disks have the same diskname but
all ids should be different. This cannot
be ensured because commercial disks
already have an unchangeable id which

could match one of your disks id's. Nine
times out of ten this wouldn't matter but
if a disk in the disk drive is swapped for
another disk with the same id, the drive
will not realise that a change has been
made and chaos will inevitably follow.
When a disk is placed in the drive,
the drive will read a map from the disk
only if the new disk has a different id to
the last disk used. This RAM (Block
Allocation Map) tells the drive which
parts of the disk have been used to store
program information and which parts
are free. If the disk has the same id as the
last one used, the drive will not realise
that a change has been made and will
start writing to the new disk according to
the BAM o f  the previous disk. This
means that precious information on the
neew disk would be destroyed because
the drive doesn't know it is there.
The drive number is always zero and
can be omitted on most machines as
shown. The ROM chip is based on the
old dual drive system and still reserves
space inside the drive for the drive 1
BANA. When y ou become proﬁcient
with disk drive programming this could
be worth noting to free internal disk
memory for other purposes.
Other commands f ollow  similar
syntactical conventions.
If you must use two disks with the
same id, an initialise command before
accessing the information on the disk
forces the drive to read the BAM on the
disk. This command should not b e
confused w ith formatting, initialise
merely reads from an already formatted
disk.

Some of the commands available are
for dual drives and can b e ignored
because they either don't work with a
single drive or perform no really useful
function. These commands are COPY,
BACKUP and DUPLICATE.
With the V2.0 Basic on the Vic and
C64 you cannot list the directory to the
screen alone. It must be loaded as a
program (with LOAD"S",8) thus erasing
any program in memory. The situation is
happier with the other machines using
DIRECTORY to list the disk contents on
the screen. On the C128 you can also use
the world CATALOG.
Sometimes after an unsuccessful save
attempt a  directory entry  w ill b e
followed by an asterisk and the block
count w ill b e  O. T his  i s  k now n
colloquially as a 'splat ﬁle'. The block
count shows h o w  muc h space the
program occupies on the disk. As a
rough guide divide this number by four
to get an approximation of the length of
the program in kilobytes. A zero block
count shows that something has gone
terribly wrong. Before attempting to
save again, the disk should be tidied up.
Vic 20/64
PRINT # 15,"V0'
C-16/PLUS/4/C128
COLLECT
This frees any disk space which may
be locked up by splat ﬁles or unallocated
blocks left around by deletions.
There comes a time when program
ﬁles must be removed from the disk.
There are two ofﬁcial ways to do this but
only one of them is trustworthy.
The worst way to erase, or scratch, a
ﬁle is  using t he save and replace
command. Popular rumour has it that if
the number of stored ﬁles is a multiple of
16 the internal ﬁle pointers can get
screwed up. No one really knows for
sure what happens and so it is best never
to use this command.
It is  better t o  erase the original
program with the normal SCRATCH
command before saving the modiﬁed
version under the old ﬁlename.
Vic 20/C64
PRINTS* 157S0:progname"
C-16/PLI15/4/C128
SCRATCH"progname"
Changing the name of a stored program
can b e  achieved with the following
• commands:
Vic 20/C64
PRINT #  157RO:new progname=old
progname"
C-16/PLUS/4/C128
RENAME "old progname" TO  "new
progname"
To load a program using the asterisk, you
can use one of two forms. When a load
instruction takes the form LOAD"*",8,1
the last program accessed on the disk
will be loaded into memory. The 1' tells
the computer that this program does not
go to the usual place where Basic is
stored but that it should relocate it to the
chunk of memory where it was originally
positioned from.
If the syntax LOAD":*,8,1 is used
then the ﬁrst program on the disk will
load no matter which program was last
accessed. The earlier form, without the
colon, behaves in the same way as this if
the disk has just been initialised using
the PRINT # 1571" command.
Disks are not quite as sensitive as the
warnings may indicate but should always
89
be treated w it h  respect. Certainly
physical contact with the disk surface
should b e avoided as should strong
magnetic ﬁelds.
Often it is tempting to cut a square
slot on the opposite edge of the disk to
the write protect/enable slot so that
both sides of the disk can be used. Two
warnings should be issued with this
practice. Firstly, the disks are single-
sided disks. Many single sided disks start
life as dual sided disks which have failed
their quality test on one side only. Trying
to use the second side opens up these
potential problems.
The second consideration is  the
design of the drive. As the head reads or
writes on one side of the disk, the other
side spins on a felt support pad. If a tiny
bit of grit settles on this pad the surface
of the disk will be damaged. On a single
sided disk this would not matter too
much but on a doubled disk it could
prove catastrophic.
I double my disks and I've rarely had
problems but as you can imagine my
experience o f  this  has  n o t  been
troublefree and has sometimes proved
costly.
Buying a disk drive doesn't solve the
pr oblem o f  h e a d  a l i g n m e n t
experienced with tape recorders. An
error on a disk is usually followed by that
loud chattering s ound whic h s till
frightens the life out of me when I hear
it. It sounds horrendous and sometimes
it can knock your head out of alignment.
Fast formatters are particularly guilty of
doing this and head re-alignment can be
expensive. As a small help you may be
interested in this short utility from Paul
Barham of Darwen. Lancashire.

•
Half track seeking means that the
head searches the disk a half track on
either side of the normal alignment. This
has enabled me to read a disk which was
created when my drive was slightly out
of kilter. I hope it helps you one day.

HOPEFULLY THIS SUMMER WON'T BE
as wet or cold as last year however in the
unhappy event of it being an action
replay, I've been looking at ways of
helping to alleviate the boredom that a
combination o f  weather and school
holidays can create.
Of course n o t  all t h e  products
looked at here are marketed as educa-
tional but then again we are looking at
the summer break period and it doe.sn't
seem quite fair to insist on non-stop
learning, in any case a lot of the prog-
rams have a fair amount of subliminal
education.
OK let's get down to some ideas.
Tongue Tied
Learn a language (or brush up on one
you know).
If you want to use a couple of days
practising y our French verbs before
ﬂying off to the Cote d'Azure try La
Conjugalion from Edstat. This is a disk
and instruction booklet pack which sets
Out to help you improve your use of
verbs. It does this by the time tested
method of game playing. There are four
games to play, each testing a different
combination of tenses. In each game
you select the verbs you want from a
comprehensive list and then decide on
the tense or tenses you wish to use. After
that you play a game and try to beat the
computer.
In the ﬁrst game "Sky Burst", you
have to burst the balloons that do not
match the red one. The aim being to test
your knowledge of verb endings. In
"Train Spotting" you have to spot and

on how to ﬁll those long,
hot, summer, days.
record the tense. The signal lights let you
know how you're doing.
"Air Display" and "Walled In" test
your knowledge by asking you to put
your chosen verb in the same tense as
the computer's in one game and build a
wall of knowledge in the other.
A ﬁnal game called "Masterplay"
tests you on all you have learnt in the
previous games. Quite a good package
and well worth a look at.
For the absolute beginner or anyone
wanting to reinforce what they know,
Audiogenic offers a Linkword system.
These programs use the premise that
certain ideas or memory joggers help
the retention o f  something learnt.
Learning noun genders, for example,
can be a chore but the linkword way is to
picture the word you are learning in a
fun way. The French for dog is 'le chien'
(masculine) and i t  can help i f  you
remember the image of a boxer getting
into a boxing ring. This links the ideas of
male boxer to boxer dog. Conversely,
cat is feminine in French and it may help
to visualise a beautiful Persian cat sat on
the Shah of Iran's knee. This is a double
jogger since the French for cat (La chat)
sounds similar to shah and the Persian
cat is a feminine image.
The linkword system is available on
both the 64 and the Vic plus 8K memory
and covers a  range o f  languages.
Overall, the system works well.
Star Quality
Become a Hollywood or  Ealing (not
Broadway) mogul.
If you don't feel like serious activi-
ties, how about something creative?
There are several graphics systems on
the market but apart from creating static
pictures there isn't much else you can do
with them. Ariolasoft has extended the
"construction k it" concept to include
animation T he Movie construction set.
This package uses the well tried concept
that if you look at a sequence of slightly
different pic tur es , y o u  w i l l  s ee
movement.
The package opts for the use of
multicolour high resolution graphics
rather than sprites. thus allowing full
screen animation. The package is laid
out in a manner similar to the structure
of a ﬁlm studio. There is an art depart-
ment, a camera man, a sound man and a
director. Each is used to build up the
ﬁnal sequence. The really bad news
about the package is that the manual is
written by Americans, presumably for
Americans. This means a rather involved
and not particularly readable time.
The programming is  o f  a  high
standard and is versatile. In essence, you
create y o u r  drawings , la y  d o w n
sequences of movement over several
tracks (allowing parallel movement)„
add t h e  mus ic  a n d  s mooth t h e
animation. Overall, a  nic e product
which is  limited only by  the child's
imagination and creativity.
Music Maestro

Your C o m m o d o r e  Ch r is t m a s  '85).  P r o -
bably the best around at the moment is
the Music System from Rainbird. This
comes in two versions: the beginners
system and the advanced system. Most
of you will ﬁnd the beginners system
quite sufﬁcient for the creation of music.
The system has two segments: a
music editor and a  synthesiser. The
music editor allows you to write a three
part piece of music. You can either enter
it by playing the tune. The plastic "Sight
and Sound" keyboard overlay works
with the system and you lay down the
tracks in the same way that you use a
tape recorder. Facilities are provided to
allow you to smooth out the timing of
your masterpiece and limit the note
length depending on your ability.
Alternatively, you can enter notes
direct from written music. All the stand-
ard notation is supported and you can
transpose your piece at will. This, in
itself, is a powerful education aid in that
you can instantly link a sequence of
written notes to its sound. Handy if you
can't play from sight.
Once you've written your music, you
can modify and create sounds using the
synthesiser. An additional software fea-
ture called t h e  Dynamic Response
Envelopes allows you to create the most
bizarre squeaks, burbles and other
noises.
This isn't the cheapest package but
it's excellently designed and is a joy to
use.
Light Relief
To many people the computer is simply
a games machine and it is true that there
is a multitude of "kill the nasty" type
games. Despite my earlier comments, it
is difﬁcult to see how killing an alien will
educate y ou. However, there is  a
category of game which can tach you a
great deal - the adventure.
In the early days, adventures were
simple affairs in which you went around
picking up treasures
and killing nasties -
•
not very educational. There is now,
however, a new breed of adventure in
which you can interact with the scenario
- Infocom calls it "interactive ﬁction".
Such games encourage the use of logic,
lateral thought and problem solving.
The examples are legion but the com-
panies w or th noting ar e Infocom,
Telarium and Activision.
Infocom specialises i n  tex t only
games based on disks. The plots are
complex, amusing a n d  difﬁcult t o
unravel. The range of game is wide
covering t h e  surreal (Hitch Hiker's
Guide t o  the Galaxy), science ﬁction
(Suspended and Starcross), fantasy (the
Zork Trilogy, Spellbinder) and crime
(Deadline). I recommend these games
without reservation.
Telarium offers text/graphics games
generally based on well known ﬁctional
works. Earlier games include larhenheit
451, Rendezvous w i t h  Rama a n d
Amazon. The two most recent games are
Nin Princes in Amber and a Perry Mason
game. Having read the book. I found
that Nine Princes in Amber follows the
original work closely. There is a variety
of possible endings which depend on
decisions made during play. The plot is
perhaps less complex than Infocom's
but with excellent graphics, it is highly
playable. There are additional elements
including combat which add to the usual
adventure concepts.
Activision is a relative newcomer to
adventures but nevertheless is  pr o-
ducing polished and high quality games.
There is an increasing interest in role
playing games, rather along the lines of
Dungeons and Dragons. These tend to
be rather more biased to graphics but
the skills required are different. These
games are generally real time with the
need f o r  instant decisions and the
control and distribution of resources,
Alternate Reality and Ultima I/ are
two excellent examples. These use good
graphics to portray your travels. In these
games you must interact with other
beings, barter for goods and
food and generally act as you
would in real life.
A slight variant on the
theme is Seven Cities of
Gold. In this game you
play a Christopher
Colombus ty pe w h9 is
exploring the new world.
By discovering places and
getting gold, you earn
wealth and fame. By
spending your gains on
new ships, men, provisions and goods,
you can explore further and achieve
more. The graphics are again excellent
and this is a challenging game which
needs care and thought.
Due to the data requirements, all of
these games are disk based although
Activision has converted some games to
cassette.
Do it Yourself
If you don't want to play but do seek
mental stimulus, how about writing your
own game?
There are a number of game creation
packages around. If adventures are your
thing, The Quill is a well known system.
This allows you t o  create your own
adventure database for your personal
use or sale. This can be enhanced by a
picture drawing add-on.
If you would rather create a graphical
adventure, Ariolasoft's Adventure Con-
struction Kit is a possibility. This allows
you to design your own graphics and
layout and then lay down the rules for
play. The system is  most suited t o
Dungeon a n d  D r agon scenarios
although others are possible.
II arcade games are for you, two
packages are worth a look.
Activision offers Gamemaker. This
combines backdrop, sprite, sound and
music editors which can then be incor-
porated in the game logic. A simple pro-
gramming language is provided to allow
animation, movement and the speciﬁ-
cation of collision and movement rules.
Very slick albeit a little pricey. If your
wallet doesn't r un t o  this package.
Mirrorsoft offers a cheaper and simpler
Games Creator. It is less ﬂexible but
works pretty well.
Most of these pieces of sotfware can
easily be purchased at your local shop so
why not give them a look. The list is
really aimed as a  guide rather than
intended to be exhaustive. The idea was
to make suggestions as to the sort of
activities which can be tried by one or
more children to pass time and have fun
but they also include a touch of learning.

otaitt! Rit110, 1 1
David Janda keeps you in
touch.
AT THE TIME OF WRITING THE COM-
modore show has just ended. It was
good to see many faces behind the ID's
and have a good old natter! The show
itself (comms wise) was VERY interesting,
so without any further delay — on with
the news!
Micronet
First TurboChat. This service should be
well under way by the time you read this.
have covered the facilities it offers
before, but to recap it will be a fast chat
facility where the screen is split into four
parts. New messages will be highlighted
as they appear in each of the portions
and there will be a facility to scroll back
though an archive of 100 messages. The
news is the price. TurboChat will cost a
penny per message sent —  no time
charge. There will be no cost incurred
looking a t  t h e  current o r  previous
messages. Now at a measly penny to
send a message, TurboChat will knock
the spots off Compunet's Partyline as far
as value for .
Several months ago Filebox, the
method of  transferring ﬁles between
users on Prestel, was in the news. This
facility is only available for BBC micto
users at present because the Filebox
manager software has only been written
for said micro. With the event of Vascom
I hope that Prestel and/or some third
party software houses get their act to-
gether and write Filebox managers for
other micros s u c h  as the C64! We shall
see.
Compunet
The alphanumeric GOTOs are now in
operation on CNET. This means that
some page numbers will be replaced
with words, such as NEWS instead of
107701 and so on. A directory of Alpha-
gotos should be up on CNET by now,
and the keyword which replaces the
number will appear on the directory
heading. So instead of fumbling about
with bits o f  paper looking u p page
numbers for this and that, you can spend
a lot of time online trying to guess what
the damned page is called instead!
Review!
Yup. Here is the ﬁrst review in Com-
munication Corner. I have promised a
review of the Voyager 7 modem from
Modem House for some months now.
Alas, delays in getting BABT approval
and the lack of appropriate software for
the device has prevented me from re-
viewing the modem previously. Anyway,
here are my ﬁrst impressions of  the
Voyager 7  V21/V23 m o d e m  f r o m
Modem House as used with Mustang 64
Communications Cartridge V2.0 from Y2
Computing. Unfortunately the lack of
software and manuals for the modem
means that I cannot supply the full spec,
but planet brain has managed to pull
through!
The Voyager 7 is a V21/V23 device
which is suitable for use with Viewdata
and scrolling types of DB, The baud rates
available are 300/300, 1200/75, 75/1200,
and 1200 half-duplex. A test mode allows
the modem to be tested ofﬂine at 300
baud_ The Voyager 7 offers auto-dial and
auto-answer as  standard a n d  Bell
frequencies are available o n  export
models only.
The modem is of 'average' size; 165x
14.5x55mm. Four rubber feet keep the kit
ﬁrmly on the table or whatever, and an
ample length of mains and PISN cable is
provided. A  ﬁve-pin domino ty pe
(female) socket at the back is used to
connect the Voyager to the Comms
Cartridge, and a six-way rotary switch on
the front panel is used for selecting the
baud rate (originate or answer) or test
mode. Five coloured LEDs on the front
indicate data ﬂow, power, carrier detect
and so on. In all the design is ﬁne. I
would have liked to have seen an inline
socket at the back of the modem which
would save you from buying a splitter
socket, but these things do tend to up
the cost.
The Mu s t a n g  Co mmu n ica t io n s
Cartridge is a 16K Eprom housed in a
cartridge case with modem lead extend-
ing from it. The package incorporates
Viewdata and Terminal modes, and is
menu driven with selections made by
pressing the appropriate function key
(surprise?).
The package will allow the user to
dial manually or by entering a phone
number automatically. Options in View-
data and Terminal mode allow numbers
to b e  dialled fr om a  directory o f
numbers held o n  a  directory disk
(optional). An excellent aspect of this
package is the setting of devices. Ten
types of printer are supported and a
Centronics driver is included. Device
numbers can b e  allocated and t he
package can load/save data to and from
disk or tape.
In Viewdata mode a mailbox can be
prepared ofﬂine and this facility can also
be used t o  enter your user ID and
password.
The terminal mode is a little mroe
complex offering options for 1200/75
dial, 75/1200 answer, as well as 300/300
dial/answer. Another option from the
terminal menu enables characteristics —
such as line feeds, start and stop bits —to
be deﬁned and so on.
In Use
Setting u p  th e  Voyager and Mustang
Cartridge was no problem whatsoever.
Even though I  didn't have a manual
handy, it only took a few minutes to get
the hang of the software. A nice feature
about the Viewdata mode is that a real-
time clock displays the amount of time
logged on. Pressing Fl whilst online,
would return you to a help menu with
options for downloading, re-displaying
a page and such like. The more experi-
enced user can access all these features
whilst online by  simply pressing the
appropriate function key.
The terminal mode was a bit dis-
appointing i n  use. Lots  o f  online
information such as ﬁle status, time XON
status are displayed and a comprehen-
sive help menu is also available. The two
features missing from this package are
1200/1200 baud half-duplex support and
the popular XMODEM ﬁle transfer
protocol.
When used together the Voyager 7
and t h e  Mustang Cartridge comple-
mented each other. The only niggle I
have is that the Terminal mode of the
Mustang C a r t r i d g e  w o u l d  v e r y
occasionally drop the line before the
service ev en answered t h e  phone!
Other than that the modem and soft-
ware make an excellent combination
and I wouldn't hesitate in recommend-
ing them.

The Intelligent
Word Processor
yOu need a sophisticated and powerful word processor t h i s  is the ultimate
Trevor Doherty, Commodore Hortzons July 1985
What is Superscript ? -
Superscript comb aes word processor, spelling checker, calculator and ma ilmerge
facility, all in one package So Superscript gives you all the tools you need to
produce high quality reports, tables, lists, personalized letters and even labels
quickly and efﬁciently Superscript is a remodeled and vastly enhanced version of
the popular Easy Script and Easy Spell programs that have sold more Man
350.000 copies worldwide, so you know you can rely on it
Simple for the beginner
If you are a newcomer to word processing, Superscript 's simple command menus
put you immediately at ease.
Each command is a single word, and for each command there s an extra line of
helpful description To select a command, you simply move the cursor. You don't
even have to type the commarid I
Once you are more familiar wi h Superscript, you can bypass the menus.
Powerful for the experienced user
Superscript also gives you the ability to cut work down to a minimum by storing your
own Command sequences or text on single keys. This means that with a single
keystroke you can reproduce commonly used phrases or multi-line addresses from
a glossary, load in document formats or execute a pre-programmed sequence of
operations. That's intelligence
Editing options
Superscript gives you all The editing options of a business-style word processor, with
full block manipulation for cut-and-paste: overtype or text insertion modes; search
and replace with pattern matching arid optional case discrimination; backward
search: case shifts for single words or larger blocks of text. Arid much more.
Good with numbers
Superscript allows you to extend your editing line up to 240 columns for wide
documents like ﬁnancial statements, and with decimal tabs it's easy to enter
properly justiﬁed tables of numbers.
Superscript's complete set of calculator functions can be used interactively, or
you can operate on numbers from the text of your document. Apart from the usual
mathematical functions like add, subtract, multiply, divide, and percentages, you
have the ability to add rows, columns or even whole tables
Good with spelling, too
The built-in spelling checker goes right through your text, checking the unique words
against its dictionaries, and stopping at each one it does not recognize You have the
option to correct the error, learn the new word or ignore it. Superscript has its own
30,000 word dictionary In addition, it stores new words as it learns them
Mailings with Superscript
Personalized mailings are easy with Superscript. You can enter the data manually or
use data extracted from your spreadsheet or database Merging can be selective
with equal-to r not-equal-to logic. A mailing labels template is included to help you
complete your mailing and you can alter the template to suit your own label format.
Attention Easy Script users!
If you're an Easy Script user, then Superscript is the obvious choice. With its
enhanced features and more powerful facilities, you llbe able to do so much
more There are no compatibility problems either You can run your Easy Script
data or Easy Spell dictionary disks under Superscript.

Database
For sheer quality and professionalism,
Superba se is in a class of its own.
Easy to get started —
The test thing you'll notice about Superbase is the superb 230 page owner's
manual.
The tutorial section takes both ﬁrst-time and experienced users right from ﬁrst steps
through accomplished programming, while the reference section is a model of
completeness. You'll enjoy the manuars easy style, its plentiful illustrations and
comprehensive index.

You s oon he ready to set up your own ﬁling system - business inlormatior
professional data, records of all kinds You design your record layout right on the
screen, exactly as you wish it to look, with helpful on-screen explanations never
more than a step away.
With the layout in place, you can then use Superbase'sbuilt-in commands to enter,
change or delete individual records Once you have built up a tile of records, you can
select, sod and output data exactly as you need II. To begin with, you'll be accessing
Superbase commands through menus. The menus lead you step•by-step to the
required action. Nothing could be simpler 1
The hidden power -
As you become more familiar with Superbase you'll want faster ways of accessing
commands One way is through the command line Any sequence at menu options
can also be typed directly Onto the second line of the screen, known as the command
line. But this is just the beginning
The real power of Superbase is that you can string any number of these commands
together to form complete programs When writing programs, not only do you have
access to the dozens of powerful Superbase commands you can also use the
complete set of ordinary BASIC language commands
This capability turns a straightforward data management system into a
true database of incredible power.
Developing complex applications for yourself becomes a realistic proposition,
with your hardware conﬁguratioe as the only limiting factor
The integrated ofﬁce —
Superscript and Superbase wj11 actually load into the computer's memory together
This means that you can switch between Superbase and Superscript at will passing
information between the two and working on your ﬁling system and documents
without ever having to reload. That's integration !

Allen Webb shows
you how to speak I
ﬂuently to your 1
'computer.
ONE O F  T HE ESSENTIAL
pieces of equipment for  a
machine code programmer is
an assembler. I have recently
managed to get hold of a copy
of Laser G e n iu s  f r o m
Oasis/Ocean and I've had a
good play around with it. My
reaction is that, at the price
(about 115 on cassette and 120
on disk), it's a real gem!
The assembler/editor is
essentially the same as that in
Machine Lightning so there's
no real surprises from that
quarter. Unlike most other
assemblers, this package uses
its own operating system
rather than the 64's editor.
This not only means a lot of
extra toil for the author but
you get a  large range o f
additional commands and
toolkit aids. I found this a little
inhibiting since a crash when
testing your own programs
means that you must reload
the system. With assemblers
which use the 64's editor, a
quick stab of the reset button
followed b y  a n  O L D
command generally saves the
day.
The gem of the system is
the new monitor/analyser. I
wasn't too happy about the
monitor w i t h  M a c h i n e
Lightning a n d  t h is  n e w
addition is a great improve-
ment.
On its simplest level, you
can use the monitor to set
imple break  points  a n d
Nle s tep thr ough t h e
program. This allows you to
keep an eye o n how  the
registers c h a n g e  a n d
hopefully locate errors. If you
have a complex program or
have an intractable error, the
analyser m a y  h e lp .  T h e
analyser uses a  subset o f
FORTH t o  allow  y o u  t o
specify a break point. You
could, f or  example, cause
your program to stop the very
instant t h a t  a  s pec iﬁed
Eli
location is read. To the more
experienced machine code
user, this ability would be
very handy.
I don't really have space
here t o  fully  review this
product, no doubt someone
else at Your Commodore will
do this. I will simply say that,
in my opinion, at the price,
this package is probably the
best around at the moment.
I mentioned a thing called
a break point. When the 6510
encounters a  zero byte, it
performs a  j u m p  t o  t h e
address h e ld  i n  locations
$O 316 a n d  $O  31 7. T h is
normally performs a  warm
reset returning you to a blank
screen with READY at the top.
Machine c o d e  monitor s
change these addresses t o
that when a  zero by te is
executed, t h e  monitor  is
entered. This allows you to
examine the registers and sort
out what's happening. The
instruction BRK inserts a zero
byte to allow breaks.
The use of BRK is handy if
you're worried about a crash
and want the program to stop
at a speciﬁc point.
Some o f  t h e  m o s t
frequently used features of
the 64 are t he interrupts.
There are three available:
1) The inter r upt reques t
(IRO)
2) The non-maskable inter-
rupt (NMI)
31 Raster interrupts.
The IRO operates 50 times
a s ec ond. I t  scans t h e
keyboard and handles the
clock. Every 50th of a second,
the processor stops what it's
doing a n d  jumps  t o  t h e
address h e ld  i n  locations
$0314 and $0315 (SEA31). This
performs t h e  necessary
functions before returning to
normal processing. I t  is  a
simple matter to wedge extra
code into the IRO. Consider
listing 1:

Lines 100 to  160 put the
start address of the new code
into the IRO jump address,
•„ This introduces two new in-
structions:
SE!: this disables the interrupt
by setting the interrupt ﬂag.
This prevents the execution
of t h e  IRO  before we've
changed the jump address.
CU: t h i s  r es tor es  t h e
interrupts once the wedge is
complete.
The m a i n  r o u t in e  i s
designed t o  c hange t h e
screen and border roughly
once a second. Location 900 is
a counter. This is incremented
every time t he routine is
called and the colours are
changed every time it reaches
50. Since the routine is called
50 times a second, this should
happen o n c e  a  second.
Geddit? Line 310 is vital since
once the routine is ﬁnished,
we must ﬁnish the normal
IRO action. If you run the
routine, you will see that the
64 will run as normal except
that the screen will change
colours continuously. Basic
programs will run as normal
albeit slightly more slowly.
Raster interrupts work in
conjunction with the IRO and
perform action depending on
the position o f  the screen
scan. Listing 2 shows how to
get split screen effects.
Lines 110 to 330 set up the
raster routine. This is similar
to the simple IRO routine
except that the raster check
must be set up. Lines 120 to

150 turn o n  the 1RQ raster.
Lines 180 to 210 set the initial
value into the raster compare.
Lines 340 to 350 check to see if
the raster scan has reached
the required position. If not it
branches to LOOP1 and exits
via the RTI (RTI clears the

M a c h i n e  c o d e
interrupt ﬂag, restores the
status register and performs
an RTS). If the scan is at the
switch point, the new set of
Vic register values are set up
and the new switch point put
into the raster compare iline
550). If the last zone has been
handled, the routine exits via
the nor mal I R Q  address
(LOOP3).
Line 650 onwards hold
tables o f  t h e  Vic  register
values, REG1 a n d  REG2
specify the graphics mode
and line 700 determines the
character type. As set up, the
routine makes the top 10 lines
of the screen pale green with
lower case characters and the
bottom 15 lines dark green
with upper case characters.
Sorry if my commentary
on this routine is brief but
space doesn't allow a fuller
description. If you study the
routine you should be able to
sort it out.
I want to start discussing
one of the most valuable funds
of routines available, t h e
ROMs. By using many of the
on-board routines, you can
save a lot of time and grief.
First, w e  have t he Kernal
ROM. Most of the routines
are accessed from a  jump
table ( t o  a l l o w  upw ar d
c ompat ibilit y  b e t w e e n
machines) near the top of
memory.
Some of the most useful
follow.
Plot
This routine, depending on
the carry ﬂag, either sets or
reads the cursor position. The
X register is used to hold the
row and the Y register to hold
the column of the cursor. If
the carry is set, the routine
returns t he current cursor
position in these registers. If
the carry is cleared, the cursor
is s e t  according t o  t h e

simple demo.
CHRIN ($FFCIF)
This routine reads a byte from
the current input channel.
Unless you open a different
channel, it  ﬂashes a cursor
and awaits an input. Listing 4
awaits an input and when
RETURN is pressed, it puts the
text input into a buffer -  in
this case the top of the screen.
The r o u t i n e  f u n c t io n s
correctly but for some reason
the text is moved to the buffer
only after RETURN is pressed.
Can anybody tell me why? (I

Homework
Wre've got a lot to cover this
month, s o  let's  g e t  las t
month's homework out of the
way quickly.
Question 1 is a commonly
encountered situation and is
easily solved. Here is  one
solution:
Listing 7
10 ASSEMBLE 90.1

340 REM ADC JO
350 REM STA LOC+1
360 REM RTS
370 REM
The basic equation is:
LOC = 1024 + (Y-1) x 40 + X
Where Y is in the range one to
24 and X is in the range one to
39.
The r outine splits t h e
equation i n t o  thr ee a n d
works on that basis. First, it
puts 1024 into LOC (lines 130-
160), it then adds (Y-1) x 40
and ﬁnally adds on X. You will
appreciate that when Y=1, the
middle por tion i s  unnec -
essary. Lines 175 and 180
detect t h i s  a n d  br anc h
accordingly. T h e  m id d le
portion evaluates the multi-
plic ation b y ,  r epeat ed
additions. For example, 40 x 5
is the same as adding 40 ﬁve
times. Lines 190 to 270 do this.
To save space, lines 175 and
180 are used to jump out of
this process. The rest is simple
16 bit arithmetic.
Questions two and three
are linked. Let us consider
how t h e  h ig h  resolution
screen works. The screen is
split in t o  1000 characters
squares. Eac h c harac ter
square holds eight rows of
eight dots. Each dot in any
row is  controlled b y  t h e
relevant bit in that byte. For
example, the leftmost dot is
controlled by bit seven and
the rightmost dot by bit zero.
To set a dot, you simply set the
relevant bit. This is achieved
by ORing the relevant bit with
a mas k . Sinc e eac h b i t
represents a power of two in
binary, we OR with two raised
to the power of the bit.
Question 3 asks you to do
the reverse. We want to erase
a speciﬁc bit. This is achieved
by ANDing with a mask. Since
we want to leave all the other
bits untouched, t h e  mask
must comprise o f  all ones
except f o r  t h e  b it  t o  b e
cleared i.e. to erase bit one
use %11111101, to erase bit six
use %10111111. These masks
are s i m p l y  t h e  o n e s
complement of the bit value
(bit value minus 255). The
routine t o  d o  t h e  j o b
becomes:
LDY 10
LOX BIT
LDA ($EB),Y
AND TABLE,X
STA ($EB),Y
RTS
TABLE .BYTE 254,253,251,247,
239,223,191,127
The h o me wo rk f o r th is
month fo llo ws m y  general
theme of being nastier:
1) An easy one. A routine to
ﬂash line messagesomewhere
near the bottom of the screen
(e.g. "Press a key to start").
2) A routine to download the
character s et t o  start a t
location 12288 and turn it on.
Here is a Basic program which
does the job:
10 POKE 52,48. POKE 56,48
20 POKE 56334,PEEK(56334)
AND 254
30 POKE 1,PEEK(1) and 251
40 FOR 1=0 TO 511
50 POKE 12288+ I,PEEK(53248
+I)
60 NEXT
70 POKE 1,PEEK(1) OR -
80 POKE 56334,PEEK(56334)
OR 1
90 POKE 53272,(PEEK(53272)
ND 240)+12
It's up to you to sort out
how this works.
3) If you've got example 2
working, w r it e a  r outine
which rolls the design of the
c harac ter s p e c iﬁe d  i n
location 900 one pixel to the
left. Don't forget that a roll
moves the leftmost pixel to
the rightmost position so that
eight rolls should leave you
with the starting design.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the_ real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace. and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands, or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really corn-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer_
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIX. QUINX
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card
