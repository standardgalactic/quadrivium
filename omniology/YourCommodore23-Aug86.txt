having said that, there are still a lot of
interesting products ﬁnding their way to

BUDGET SOFTWARE IS ON THE UP
and up. Firebird has recently been
proud to announce that it is the ﬁrst soft-
ware company to have its products sim-
ultaneously at number one in the UK
(Gallup) and the Staes (Billboard).
The two products which helped to
achieve this acolade are Thrust, a game
in the Firebird silver range, and the now
famous title, Elite which has at last made
it to the top in the US at the reasonable
price of a mere $29.95.
Firebird has now announced a new
set of budget titles, which, it is claimed,
"are available to every confectioner and
newsagent i n  t h e  country". These
include one game for the C64/C128,
Caves of Eriban, and two for the C-16,
Runner and Shark.
Another Firebird offer is the Silver
Club, which enables you to purchase a
11,99 game of your choice arid with it
you receive a package of goodies and a
newsletter.
Not to be outdone, Mastertronic is
releasing some new games for Com-
modore machines.
In the 11.99 range are two titles.
Firstly, a volleyball simulation entitled,
Bump Set Spike -  Double Volleyball.
Attributes of the game include!: crowd
applause, professionally composed
music, choice o f  courts (beach o r
indoor) and nine difﬁculty levels.
Those who are interested in sampling
the high life of the professional gambler
may like to go for Vegas Poker, also E1,99
and for the C64.
Two titles  n o w  av ailable o n
Mastertronic's 12.99 MAD  label are
Countdown t o  Meltdown and Ic e
Palace. The former involves the now
tragic scenario o f  an accident at a
nuclear power plant and the latter
enters the land of fairy tales to bring you
face to face with the wicked Ice queen.
CRL's budget table, Alpha-Omega.
has recently launched a new Commo-
dore title, let Strike Mission. The game is
a combat ﬂight simulator where your
task is to avoid enemy air and ground
attacks and seek out and destroy the
target. The price is14.95. Yes, it is on the
budget label.

A NEW VERSION OF POPEYE, THE
computer game, has been released at
0.95 by Macmillan Software. The game
deals with the classic situations which
the spinach munching her o daily
encounters in his attempts to protect his
rather ineffectual girlfriend Olive.
Popeye has recently returned to the
public eye on TV-AM every day and
Woolworths is about to launch a new
range of Popeye clothes, If you want to
join in this new exciting craze maybe
you'd better get the game tool Endear-
ingly entitled I Yarn What I Yam.
Bug-Byte, now under the wings of
Argus Press Software, has begun import-
ing software from down under for
release in this country. 0/10 I and II -
First Mission and Final Assault is the title
of the Aussie game arid was in the Top
Ten in its home country.
Claims made by Bug Byte for the
game are as follows: stunning graphics
and sonics, two games in one with four
separate sections each, and a ridiculous
level of addiction_

intellectual, emotional , phsyical, familial
and vocational.
Because of the nature of the program
there are different male and female
versions.
There is also a warning which comes
with the game. Because of the nature of
some of the material used it is unsuitable

Generally Speaking
A FURORE HAS BLOWN UP IN THE
tape manufacturing industry ov er
government plans to introduce a tape
levy on blank audio cassettes.
Christopher Hobbs, Chairman of the
Tape Manufacturers Group said it would
be ''an administrative nightmare bound
in expensive red tape perforated with
legal loopholes".
The group has issued a whole list of
objections on behalf of the manufac-
turers. They state that home taping
doesn't damage copyright owners
interests, that n o distribution of the
money realised by  the government
levy could be fair. The levy would inﬂate
the price of tapes and the administration
to collect money raised in  this way
would b e  cumbersome. The rebate
system w o u ld  als o penalis e t h e
disadvantaged, such as the blind, because
it would not include distributors and
retailers mark-ups. There is  also a
possibility that the levy is illegal under
EEC law.
The Consumers Association has also
come out against the government in this
issue saying that the levy on blank audio
cassettes is  a  "cynical excercise i n
producer muscle".
Rosemary Mc Rober ts  o f  t h e
Consumers Association said: "Ordinary
customers who buy blank tapes are not
pirates or counterfeiters, and they don't
make dozens of copies of copyright
performances."

BILCALS H A S  BEEN THE  H E R O  O F
many children down the years and, with
the advent of the movie, Mirrorsoft has
released the computer game.
Biggles is a ﬂying ace who gets into all
sorts of scrapes with his friends Algy,
Bertie and Ginger. In the ﬁlm story,
several new characters are introduced
including the beautiful double agent
Maria.
The computer program is heavily
based on the ﬁlm, It comes in two parts:
Timewarp a n d  So u n d  Weapon.
Timewarp must be completed ﬁrst if you
want to stand a chance of destroying the
Sound Weapon in part two.
Timewarp is really three games in
one. Biggles appears i n  a  biplane
shooting down enemy ﬁghters in 1917.
He can then warp into present day
London and then back t o  ground
combat in 1917.
Biggles in the Air sees our hero beset
by enemy planes and ﬂak. He can ﬁre his
cannon at the planes or drop bombs on
the cannon but his bombs are limited.
You always have to keep one bomb in
reserve to hit an enemy arsenal which
replenishes your supply. Manipulatin
the plane to avoid the enemy ﬁre
become quite tricky, especially wl n
enemy plane is zeroing in on yo
time a ﬂash of lightening ca

r

to leap 
n
 b u ik  t o  building,
avoiding e  
d
s
 and gunﬁre.
Only one of t 
s
 can be moved at a
time, the other quats awaiting his turn
to move. At all times both characters
must be on the screen. The strategy is to
take a long run up and jump across to
the nex t building, av oiding t h e
patrolling guards. Then ﬁnd somewhere
sate for the character to wait while you
bring his twin across.
This is not an easy task especially
when a sniper starts shooting from a
nearby window. Once again time warps
will blast you out of this scenario.
In Biggles on the Battleﬁeld you may
think for a moment that you've warped
into a game of Commando. You haven't,
but the rules are similar. Shoot all the
guards and throw hand grenades at the
pill boxes to silence the guns. Biggles has
little room to dodge about in and he has
to descend into one of the many caves to
restock with grenades when his supply
runs out.
As a guide to your success rate three
icons are shown at the bon° t h e
screen. Each time you fail an
of icon disappears. If an
you must start again.

d compass to keep on the correct
bearing.
The radar has  t w o  modes  o f
operation. In long range mode it shows
the sector you are currently in and the
type o f  enemy you may encounter.
Avoiding areas of heavy enemy inﬁltra-
tion is advisable until you are sure of
your combat capabilities. Other areas
may also have enemy planes which
could prove deadly.
The hints and tips given for this
section are invaluable otherwise you
could be wandering across the extensive
mapped area for a lifetime, You are told
to examine the south west corner care-
fully before heading for the convent.

Extra fuel and Biggles' friends are
somewhere around here so the hint is
worth taking because without these the
mission will fail. Each friend has a
particular' skill or ability. For example,
one of the team is good at repairing the
helicopter and should prove invaluable
when the heat is reall , on.

Tony Crowther's little team, the music is
proof that Ron Hubbard is in danger of
losing his crown in the near future.
When reviewing a game I like to play
through as far as possible. Unfortunately
the fact that you need to complete the
ﬁrst part before standing a good chance
of completing the second game means
that I  only really viewed the Sound
Weapon scene as a tourist rather than as
a combatant but I  must say I  was
impressed with what I saw, even if it did
resemble a poor man's Firefox.
When a  game offers as  many
challenges as this one does it would be
impossible to say that it lacked appeal.
This is  one o f  those packages with
something for  almost everyone and
should not be ignored. If you have any
doubts don't ignore the game try to ﬁnd
a copy and give it a whirl.

On the Star MAO printer
PRINTERS ARE A PAIN IN THE NECK.
They use complicated codes, tailed let-
ters on the Commodore printers do not
descend below the line, other printers
need interfaces which means more
spaghetti trailing out the back of my
computer. and the printouts look like a
monochrome attack of the measles. If
you've ever voiced any of these reasons
for not buying a printer, Star Micronics
must have been listening because the
NI-10 printer goes a  long way t o
eliminating them.
First and foremost, the printer is
available with a Commodore interface
which ﬁts neatly and easily into a recess
in the back of the printer so you don't
spoil i t s  v er y  t r i m  appearance.
Connection to your Commodore is via
the usual standard DIN lead and the
interface has two sockets to allow daisy
chaining to other peripherals such as a
disk drive. A secondary beneﬁt of this is
that if Commodore ever changes to a
new printer operating system, Star can
Produce a new interface module to
match and save you the expense of
buying a new printer.
i he interface allows you to select
PETSCII code (Commodore's character
numbering system) or ASCII code at will.
This can involve typing a code such as:
TH IS I S  TH E N L Q TYPEFACE
THIS I S  TH E STANDARD DRAFT P R IN T U N D E
INIS LINE IS CONDENSED PITCH
THIS LINE I S  IN  ELITE PITCH

Just thought I'd throw that in to panic
you. Star does not totally get away from
the CHR$ heiroglyphics but some of the
standard pr inter  features c an b e
changed either by the usual array of DIP
switches or by skillful use of the dia-
phragm switches on the front of the
printer.
13
Switched On
The DIP switches are easily accessed at
the back of the printer but I don't see
why DIPs are so loved by the majority of
printer manufacturers. They're so small
that you have to use thetip of a ballpoint
pen or a small screwdriver to ﬂip them.
Admittedly, a three year-old child could
use them but my ﬁngers ae substantially
thicker t h a n  that. I n  a  business
environment these switches would
normally only be set once but I have to
use them a lot in my work and they really
are a nuisance. My own theory is that a
pact has been made with ballpoint pen
manufacturers to offset the unemploy-
ment that wordprocessors may create in
their industry!
The switches are set as a bank of eight
allowing or negating auto line-feed and
paper-out detection, or for setting a
standard page length, device number
plus ASCII/Commodore mode. Several

H a r d w a r e
foreign character sets can also b e
selected using a combination of three of
the switches.
The front panel selectors are used
singly or in combination to allow swift
access to varius useful printer modes. By
holding down the relevant keys when
you switch on, you can initiate a printer
test, start up in NLQ italic mode or
switch the computer into hex dump
mode.
NLQ stands for Near Letter Quality
which means that the printer takes iwo
passes to print a line but the quality is
very close to that achieved by a type-
writer or daisywheel printer instead of
the lesser quality achieved by straight
forward single pass printing (draft
mode).
The hex dump mode is very useful
for checking the output from y our
computer to the printer. Instead of the
usual row of characters the printer gives
the information in  raw hexadecimal
numbers. It is also a quick way of doing a
memory d u m p  f o r  machine c ode
programming purposes.
Now that I've actually reached the
point where the printer is turned on we
can investigate the other special features
of the NI-b.
Features
The front panel switches can now be
used to carefully align the top of the
paper {TOE) with the printer head and
set the right and left margins.
The ability to set margins does rather
spoil the next feature on the panel
which allows you to select the number
of characters per line. These ﬁgures are
speciﬁed for the default width of the
printed line and ar e measured i n
characters per line (CPL). If you set
margins to anything other than their
default values, then the maximum value
of CPL alters too. I would like to see the
measure of characters per inch (CPI)
listed alongside the CPL value instead of
being hidden away at the back of the
manual.
For the record the values of CPL
given are 80, 96 and 128 in draft mode
plus 80 in NLQ.
In addition to the normal pica width
characters there are three other type-
faces: elite, condensed and the afore-
mentioned italics. Bold, expanded,
emphasised, underlined, double and
quadruple height and width characters
plus proportional spacing can also be
produced. Of these only bold can be
selected directly from the front panel. If
this is not enough you can deﬁne your
own characters for special purposes.
Deﬁning characters is  the strong
point o f  matrix printers over daisy-
wheels because it allows the dumping of
high resolution screens on to paper.
Doing this does involve an extensive
amount of programming and for most
people i t  w ould b e  beyond their
abilities. Nearly all commercial sketch
pad programs have a screen dump
facility, however, and magazines have
often published them in the past. Most
of these utilities are designed for Epson
printers but because of the compatibility
of this machine with the Epson standard
most routines will be useable with the
NL-10.
Using the machine has proved to be
delight. Sprocket wheels allow the use of
tractor drive paper and a friction platten
will pull normal sheets of paper through.
This means that it is ideal for business or
private use. There is a selector switch to
the r ig h t  o f  t h e  platten w hic h
determines the paper feed mode and for
the adventurous a sheet paper hopper
for auto-feed is included.
Although Star has gone a very long
way towards user friendliness, t h e
company has failed to take advantage of
the capabilities which a machine speciﬁc
interface allows. All of the CHRS codes
could have been replaced with simpler,
user-friendly commands. Perhaps i n
future models this will be rectiﬁed, after
all we're not a nation of computrer
buffs. Compared to the opposition, this
machine is either more advanced or
cheaper and offers great value for
money.
The greatest facility which the NI-1
sports is the NLQ typeface. No more will
have spots before my eyes after a long
printing session.

IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
You sit at the computer keyboard having
just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of  the superb programs
from Your Commodore. Your ﬁngers
reach for the keyboard and press the
letters R , U  and N I .  You s it back
expectantly and.. nothing happens.
Well. I'm sure that we have all had
problem before now. When i t  does
happen it's a matter of spending hours
searching through the program for any
typing mistakes. No matter how long you
look or how many people help you, you
can usually guarantee that at least one
little bug slips through unnoticed.
Here, at Your Commodore, we pride
ourselves on the quality of listing that we
print. Unfortunately, this usually means
that they are also very long, thus taking
longer to type in and leaving more room
for errors. All of  the listings in Your
Commodore are taken straight from a
printout o f  working programs, i t  is
therefore very unusual for  errors t o
appear in the magazine.
Because of the length of our programs
we do get a large number of requests from
readers who would like us to put speciﬁc

The BIT Instruction
[machine code.
First a little snippet of news. I
hear that Ocean has brought
out a new assembler system -
Laser Genius. The company
tells me that the assembler
part is  the same as White
Lightning but there is a new
feature -  a n  analyser is
included. Apparently this
allows you to set intelligent
break p o i n t s  a n d ,  o n
breaking, examine the pre-
vious instructions. It certainly
sounds lik e the answer t o
many problems.
There is a handy instruction
called BIT which performs a
logical AND (see later this
part) of a memory location
and the accumulator. As usual
this is non-destructive. If the
result of the AND is zero, the
zero ﬂag is cleared otherwise
it is  set. Additionally, the
overﬂow and negative ﬂags
are set according to the value
of bits six and seven of the
memory location. Listing 1
gives a way of generating a
non-destructive cursor using
BIT.

This r outine is  rather
contrived but illustrates one
way of using BIT to monitor
bit seven of a single memory
location (in this case, the top
left corner o f  the screen).
Since BIT functions only in
absolute and zero page, it
isn't really suited to perform
this function for the whole
screen unless you load the
current cursor position b y
indirect index ing i n t o  a
memory location and BIT
that.
Line 100 copies the value
of bit seven of the contents of
location $0400 i n t o  t h e
negative ﬂag. It happens that
this b it  is  used t o  show
whether or not the character
on the screen is normal or
reversed ﬁeld. If bit seven is
set (reversed ﬁeld character),
the program branches to line
160 where the bit is cleared
(line 170 does this). Otherwise
line 130 sets the bit. lines 190
to 240 perform a simple delay.
You will notice that lines
130 t o 170 use some new
instructions. These are some
of the logical o r  Boolean
instructions. Boolean instruc-
tions use various rulse t o
allow the combination of bit
patterns. These are used in a
variety of ways.
The ﬁrst instruction i s
AND. This instruction follows
the following truth table:
A 
1
 
0
1 
1
 
0
0 
0
Using this table if AND
two set bits, the result is a set
bit. All other combinations
result in a zero bit. Imagine
that you want to ensure that a
location never holds more
than 15. T h e  f o r  )wing
sequence will ensure this:
IDA number
AND 115
STA location
If the accumulator con-
tains binary %11001010, this
sequence will have the effect:
%11001010 AND %00001111 =
9°00001010
19
We h a v e  effec tiv ely
masked out the top four bits.
Hence by using AND we can
selectively remove or retain
bits.
Line 170 in Listing 1 clears
bit seven by ANDing with 127
(%01 1 11 11 1). T h e  n e x t
instruction is  the inclusive
OR. This has the truth table:
A 
1
 
0
1 
1
0 
1
 
0
In effect, if either bit is set,
the result is a set bit. OR
allows the selective setting of
bits. Line 130 in Listing 1 sets
bit seven by ORing with 128
(%10000000).
Finally we have the exclu-
sive OR (EOR):
A 
1
 
0
1
0 
1
1 
0
This instruction can b e
used as a comparison tool
since dissimilar bits result in a
set bit. It can also be used to
complement or invert a bit
pattern. Consider the effect
of:
%11011011 EOR %11111111 =
%00100100
This effect is very handy in
graphics t o  obtain reverse
ﬁeld effects.
Summing It Up
N E I N =
last time I was very friendly in
my dealing with arithmetic.
Things are in fact a little more
involved than I indicated but I
didn't want to put you off
then. Now, unfortunately, we
have to look at things in a little
greater detail.
The r ules  f o r  adding
binary are quite simple:
Two zero bits when added
result in a zero bit;
Adding a zero bit to a set bit
results in a set bit
Adding two set bits results in a
zero bit and a set carry. The
following examples will show
what I mean:
I've already mentioned
that bit seven is the sign ﬂag.
What happens, therefore, if
your addition gives a result
with a set seventh bit? Clearly
this is incorrect since we've
gener ated a  n e g a t i v e
number. The answer is that this
action results in an overﬂow
which sets the V ﬂag. Here is
an example:
0
0 1 0 0 0
10001100
The overﬂow ﬂag is set
when there is a carry from bit
six t o  bith seven and can
occur in one of four situ-
ations:
i) W h e n  la r g e  pos itiv e
numbers are added.
ii) Wh e n  lar ge negativ e
numbers are added.
iii) When a  large positive
number is subtracted from a
large negative number.
iv) When a  large negative
number is subtracted from a
large positive number.
Clearly, you must make
allowances in your coding to
check for overﬂow if you are
using signed arithmetic.
In signed binary, bit seven
is set to denote a negative
number, C o n s id e r  t h is
example in which we try to
add +8 to -3
+8   0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0  +
-3  1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
10001011
The result is -11, which is
clearly incorrect. There is a
bug in adding binary this way.
The solution is to use the con-
cept of two complements to
represent negative numbers,
To get the twos complement,
you invert each bit and then
add o n e .  H er e ar e t w o
examples:
5 = 00000101
invert the bits: 11111010
NINES 11EMBRIER

add 1: 11111011 =-5
8 00001000
invert the bits: 11110111
add 1: 11111000 =-8
Let us go back to our earlier
example b u t  us ing t w o
complements:
+8.. ..000001000 +
-3_111111101
000000101
The answer is ﬁve as required.
We ignore the carry ﬂag.
Using two complementing,
we can add or subtract signed
binary numbers at will. I t
won't take much thought to
realise that subtraction i s
simply t h e  addition o f  a
number t o  the twos com-
plement of the other.
These comments will be of
most value to those of you
who wish to manipulate real
data rather than play ing
games. If that is your goal,
then further reading from a
standard text, such as Zaks, is
mandatory.
Those of you who have
used electronic measuring
equipment, may have come
across Binary Coded Decimal
(BCD). This is a frequently
used format for data trans-
mission. The 6502/6510 allow
you t o use BCD. To enter
decimal mode, you must set
the Decimal ﬂag with the
instruction SED. To return to
binary mode, you clear the
ﬂag with CID. I n  decimal
mode, a byte is used to hold
two four bit coded numbers.
These are:
CODE
BCD DIGIT
0000
0
0001
1
0010
2
0011
3
0100
4
0101
5
0110
6
0111
7
1000
8
1001
9
Consider a location holding
the bit pattern 00100010.
In binary mode it contains 34.
In decimal mode it contains:
0010 0 0 1 0
or 22!
The reason is that the left
nybble contains the 10 coded
as above and the right nybble
contains the units.
Try listing 2:
Listing 2
10 ASSEMBLE 90

120 REM LDA 900
130 REM ADCA 901
160 REM STA 902
170 REM CLD
180 REM RTS
190 REM]
Try running the routine
both in decimal mode and in
binary mode (by erasing line
100). If you try with a value of
six in each of 900 and 901, i.e.
you are adding six and six, you
should get 12 in binary mode
and 18 in decimal mode. The
reason is that the result of
adding six and six is put into
902 as the two nybbles rep-
resenting one and two:
0001 
0
0
1
0
1 
2
When y o u  peek  902,
however, you get 18 since 18
in binary is  00010010. Try
some other combinations of
numbers. Never forget t o
include the CLD instruction
before you return to Basic
since failure to do this will
cause a crash.
BCD can also be of use
when calculating scores in
games without recourse to
ﬂoating point.
The Stack
I have previously mentioned
an area of of memory called
the stack. It might be a good
idea if we ﬁnish this time with
a few paragraphs on this item.
The stack is essentially a
scratch pad which the micro-
processor uses to remember
things. For example, when
the processor executes a
jump subroutine instruction,
it must somehow remember
where to return to at the end
of the subroutine. It therefore
saves details o f  the return
address on the stack. The size
of the stack is limited which
explains why you are limited
in t h e  number o f  nested
20
GOSUBs you may have in
Basic.
Not only is the stack useful
to the machine, it  is also
useful to you. It is a simple
matter to temporarily push
data on to and pull data off
the stack. Four instructions
perform such tasks:
PHA: pushes the accumulator
contenst on to the stack.
PIA: polls the next stack value
into the accumulator,
PHP: pus hes  t h e  status
register on to the stack.
PIP: pulls the next stack value
into the status register.
The current value on the
stack is monitored in a eight
bit register called the stack
pointer. It is often handy to
save or alter this pointer. Two
instructions allow this:
TSX: transfer stack pointer to
X register.
TXS: transfer X register to the
stack pointer.
One word of warning. You
must take care to balance you
push and pull instructions
and monitor how you change
the stack pointer. If not, you
may end up with a nasty crash.
Homework
You may ﬁnd these problems
a bit more challenging.
1) Write a routine to place a
character a t  a  speciﬁed
location on the screen. (Hint:
If X is the horizontal position
(1 to 40), and Y is the vertical
position (1 t o 25), then the
memory location occupied
by the character is given by
101 024+(Y-)* 40+ X.)
2)When plotting high resolu-
tion graphics, a new point is
created b y  O R in g  t h e
relevant memory byte with a
mask corresponding to the
point to be set. This mask is
equal to two raised to the
power o f  the bit number
corresponding to the position
of the point in the memory
byte. Why?
3) Running on from question
2, the following sequence of
code will set the bit whose
value is inthe X register and
the memory location to be
masked is held in SEB and
SEC:
LDY £0
LDX BIT
LDA i$E13),Y
ORA TABLE,X
STA (VB),Y
RTS
TABLE .BYTE 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128
Write a similar routine which
will erase a sepciﬁed point_ If

modore 6 4  Programmer's
Reference Guide.
The Answers
Last month w e started o n
simple 16 bit arithmetic, The
homework s h o u ld  h e l p
reinforce the material dis-
cussed.
The ﬁrst question was a bit
of a  tr ic k  question. T o
multiply an eight bit number
by 256, you simply move the
eight bit number into the
most signiﬁcant byte of a 16
bit number and zero its least
signiﬁcant byte.
Question 2 is a frequently
met situation where you're
handling data on the screen
and you want to move down a
line. Here is my solution:
10 ASSEMBLE 90,1
90 REM *+C000
100 REM CLC
110 REM IDA 900
120 REM ADC £40

The t h ird  example wa s
simply included to make you
think a bit. This solution is the

Title:
The Anatomy of the Commodore
128
Author:
K Gerits, J Scheib & F Thrun
Publisher:
First Publishing Ltd
Price: 02.95
SUCH A DETAILED BOOK AS THIS OF-
ten takes many months to dear all of the
copyright problems which precede its
release. It's immensely pleasing to see
the C128 laid bare to the enquiring mind
so soon after the machine's UK release.
The book is in two principal sections:
a long and detailed look at accessing the
facilities offered by the computer and a
full disassembly of the ROM routines.
Although the book goes into depth
on the 128 mode, the CP/M mode is a
little more sketchy and 64 mode is
virtually ignored. This is not really a
criticism of the book, after all the C64 is
well documented already and the CP/M
section does give enough detail on the
Commodore CP/M to allow a general
book on CP/M to take over.
The ﬁrst chapters deal w ith 128
programming for the informed user. No
long duplications o f  Commodore's
introduction to Basic here, it's straight in
to the control programs for the Memory
Management U nit, 80-column high
resolution screen, accessing the Kernal
routines and much much more.
Each chapter is  dedicated t o  an
individual chip (including the Z80 and
8563 v id e o  c hip)  a n d  tec hnic al
speciﬁcations are revealed alongside the
more diges tible hints , t ip s  a n d
programs.
The R O M disassembly is  highly
detailed w it h  a  s hort description
accompanying each line of code so that
the reader can easily determine just
what the ROM is up to at any particular
point.
If you're serious about your 128 you
can't d o  better than this impressive
tome.
Title:
Tricks and Tips for the C-128
Author:
T Welt ner, R Hornig, J Trapp
Publisher:
First Publishing Ltd
Price:
11195
SOME OF THE CONTENTS OF THIS
book are duplicated in the Anatomy of
the Commodore 128 but in no way does
it destroy the value of either. Tricks and
Tips is aimed more at the intermediate
programmer than the advanced user
but, as an introduction to the hidden
abilities of the machine and as an aid to
ﬂedgling machine code programmers
looking for something to do with their
new found knowledge, it has no peers.
The large typeface used throughout
the book could be described in kinder
moments as a  useful concession t o
disabled readers who gain a  lot o f
pleasure and practical help from their
computer. If I want to be wicked, I
would say that it uses more paper and
makes the book look as thick as its
companion books thereby justifying the
22
cover price, but I wouldn't be that nasty.
The routines given, range fr om
simple software protection on disk and
tape, interrupt driven music, graphics
routines, s p r it e  a n d  c har ac ter
generation, multiple windows and the
MMU. There is even a section on adding
extra commands to Basic. For those
throwing their hands up in horror saying
that there are enough 128 commands for
even the most discerning programmer,
buy this book you'll deﬁnitely beneﬁt
from it!
Many of the smaller tips are little
gems which would take months t o
unravel if this book wls  not in your
library. The book fully describes all of
the techniques used in clear concise
English (the authors are German) and it
should provide hours o f  fascinating
study.
Title:
Commodore 64/128 Graphics
and Sound Programming
Author:
Stan Krute•
Publisher:
TAB Books Inc.
DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE TITLE. THIS
book is solely for the C64 or the 128 in 64
mode. Although this title looks good on
the cover, I think it will put off more
buyers than it attracts. C64 owners may
pass i t  over with a  cursory glance
thinking that half of the book will prove
irrelevant to their machine.
Kicking off with sprite programming,
the book soon advances to moving the
shapes around the screen and overlay
animation techniques in unicolour and
multicolour. The author then moves on
to deal with character graphics in a
similar way and then w e  have a n
elementary high resolution chapter. The
listings, and there are an awful lot of
them, are in Basic, very clearly printed
and they work (slowly).
The audio section deals with the
shaping of musical sounds and sound
effects. There are a few really good
noises in amongst this lot, One criticism I
will make is that a sample program using
machine code interrupts would have
slotted quite nicely in with the sample
machine code program at the end of the
book.
The ﬁnal section puts it all together,

sound and graphics in synchrony. The
sample program is especially synchro-
nic, it's a dull program. Two creatures
take turns dropping from a skyhook on
to a see-saw, catapulting the other back
up to the hook. Surely a small simple
game could have been developed from
this?
The appendices giv e grids a n d
programming aids which are the best
thing this book has to offer,
Title: T h e  Second B ook  o f
Machine Language
Author: Richard Mansﬁeld
Publisher: Compute! Books/
Holt Saunders
Price: £ 1
IF MACHINE LANGUAGE FOR BEGIN-
ners was  a n  introduction t o  t h e
vocaulary of machine code, then this
book is an essay on the grammar of the
language. Mo r e  than this, working
through the book gradually builds up a
powerful assembler program which not
only teaches the basics of machine code
programming structure but also acts as a
useful addition to your utility library for
creating y our  o w n  r outines  and
programs.
As the name suggests, the Label
Assembler Development System (LADS)
allows the use of labels and comments
within a program which looks like a
normal Basic program except that it uses
its own mnemonic language based on
normal machine code mnemonics.
This forms a much easier way to con-
struct a machine code program and not
being in code itself means that it can be
used to show many of the facets of pro-
gramming including communicating
with peripheral devices and maintaining
a database.
The book is written in intelligent
English which assumes nothing more
than a bit of common sense and perser-
verance on the part of the reader. Per-
severance comes in useful because you
have to enter several pages of data
which lacks the customary checksum
features of other books in the Compute!
series.
An appendix of useful subroutines
for incrementing, adding and subtract-
ing double byte numbers, multi-byte
addition and multiplication and division
adequately cover areas which can be
problematic to beginners.
Undoubtedly, the contents of this
book offers great value for money to
anyone interested i n  a  good intro-
duction to machine language.
Title: Tool Kit: Kernal
Author: Dan Heeb

Price: 03.95
CO,MPUTE! GAZETTE IS A RATHER EX-
pensive American magazine which is a
mine of information for Commodore,
Apple and Atari users, and Computers
23
books.
books of abstracts for each machine are
always good value for money.
Tool Kit: Kernal may sound like a
collection of utility programs but it is a
description of the ROM kernal routines
at the end of the memories of the C64
and Vic 20.
The book is not fully self-contained
and Computers Tool Kit: Basic, which
deals with the Basic ROM, along with a
full disassembly of the kernal memory
would be a useful companion to help
gain the full beneﬁt from the wealth of
information contained in this book.
Each chapter is a grouping of the
various subroutines in 'family' groups.
For example, all the tape I/O routines
form a large chapter which not only
describes the routines but explains the
way in which a tape ﬁle is structured.
Other chapters deal in a similar way with
interrupts and system reset, screen,
serial I/O, RS-232 and principal kernal
routines.
Apart fr om giving details o f  the
subroutines and their relatives, there is a
smattering of hints and tips and short
useful programs which demonstrate
how the kernal may be used within your
own projects.
The routines are listed in memory
order and abbreviated groupins in two
ﬁnal appendices but a more standard
index would have improved the facilities
offered by this very useful book.
Bookworm, Eric Doyle,
delves between the covers
of the best Commodore

Stuart Cooke takes a look aq
the Commodore Musk
Expansion System
I HI C O M M O D O R E  (J4  I S  ‘ A  ELL
known for its musical capabilities. In fact
the s ound is  s o good that some
companies are manufacturing audio
cassettes of computer music so that you
can listen to computer music on your hi-
ﬁl
Not satisﬁed with having a computer
that has some o f  the best sound,
Commodore, together with Music Sales,
has gone even further and produced the
Sound Expander,
The Expansion System consists of a
small box which plugs into the cartridge
port on either a Commodore 64 or 128.
This small box  will then give your
Commodore the ability to play eight dif-
ferent notes at once together with a
drum backing sound and numerous
voices.
The Expansion System contains an
FM Music Synthesis chip which pro-
duces all of the sounds. FM Synthesis is
used in the very popular Yamaha DX7
synthesisers and gives your computer
facilities very similar t o  these very
expensive machines.
In Use
Obviously before you can use the inter-
face you will have to put the sound
through some sort of ampliﬁer, leads
are provided with the interface so that
you can put the sound through either a
television or a monitor. The best sound
reproduction is achieved by putting the
sound through your hi-ﬁ or a music
ampliﬁer, the sound output going from
the interface to the AUX input on your
hi-ﬁ. The lead to do this is not included
so you will have to buy your own.
Once the controlling software is
loaded from either tape or disk you can
make music,
The various options offered to you
are chosen from pull down menus. The
menus available are;
SETUP- which allows you to choose key-
board splits, single ﬁnger chords etc.
SYNTH -  which allows you to choose
which of the preset voices you are going
to use.
RHTHYM - allows you to choose from
one of the preset drum patterns.
RIFF- allows beginners to play tunes and
listen to demo music.
DISK -  available only to people who
buy the disk version of the software. This
allows you to load in new sounds and
new music.
Using these menus is very simple.
Use functions Fl and F3 to select the
option that you want, then press 17 to
'pull down the menu'. Once the menu is
down use the same keys to move up and
• down the menu and select the approp-
riate function. The only problem that I
found with this is that there is no quick
escape option. The EXIT menu function
is always at the top of the list, if you want
to change something at the bottom of
the list then you must go down make the
necessary change and then go back up
to the top again to leave the menu. Very
time consuming.
As previously mentioned the Setup
menu allows you to set many useful
parameters. For example you can split
the keyboard wherever you want and
have one sound playing on the left hand
keys while another plays the right hand
keys. This means that you could play a
tune with an organ sound while you
the chords with a guitar sound.
You can take this even further by
using auto chords. This function allows
beginners to play chords by  simply
pressing a key. For example to play C
Major press the C key. Both major and
minor keys are available but unfor-
tunately there are no sevenths.
If you select one of the rhythms and
you have auto chording switched on, a
backing track w ill automatically b e
added to the chords, this is great for
beginners as they can play complete
tunes with just two ﬁngers, one for the
tune the other for the chords,
The sounds offered from the SYNTH
menu are pretty diverse and of excep-
tionally high quality. The voices range
from a harpsichord through to a jazz
organ so there is probably something to
suit just about every tune you are likely
to play. Disk users have the added
beneﬁt that they can load in a second set
of voices from disk.
24
The rhythm section is quite good
though it sounds a little tinny. It would
be possible to use the sound expander
on stage but on no account would you
feel happy using the built in  drum
sounds,
If y ou hav e nev er touc hed a
keyboard before you will love the RIFF
option. When you choose this option
each key has 'stored in it' a little tune.
Pressing keys at random will link up to
255 of these 'tunes' together giving quite
catchy tunes. Riffs that are available are
Country, Pop and Disco. Disk users also
have a big band sound option.
As I  have previously stated, the
interface allows you to play up to eight
notes at once. The notes being played
are represented on a musical scale on
the screen. To actually play the notes
you can either press keys on the key-
board, use an optional overlay as used
with the Commodore Music Maker, or
use an add-on keyboard.
The add-on keyboard is a ﬁve octave
full size keyboard. It is fairly well made
and has a very good 'feel' to it. People
who are used to pianos and organs will
be quite at home using it. If you are used
to a piano it is worth pointing out that
there is no touch sensitivity to the key-
board, no matter how hard you press a
key the note still plays at the same
volume.
Obviously a product like this has to
have some bad points and it  does.
However, most of my gripes are over the
documentation and the software NOT
the interface itself.
The manuals can be described as
barely adequate. There is information
on each of the functions available but
there is  no information on how to
program the interface yourself. OK so it
may be complicated but surely there are
people who would like to give it a go.
Commodore will be releasing a package
that allows you to generate your own
sounds at a later date but it has yet to be
seen if this will let you generate new
voices for use with the keyboard.
This shouldn't be too difﬁcult for the
disk system b u t  since t he cassette
version doesn't have a LOAD option I'm
fairly certain that you won't be able to
change t he voices o n  t h e  cassette
version of the software.
1

The RIFF function is great fun but
after a  little while becomes a  little
boring, after all you wouldn't listen to
the same record over and over again
would you? My personal opinion is that
the memory given over to this could
have been used to offer a few more
input options especially the option of
more voices.
If you purchase the sound expander
together with the full size keyboard then
you will also get the Commodore Sound
Studio thrown in. Being honest I can't
quite understand why  this program
comes with the package as it is used for
editing the C64's internal SID chip not
the new sound chip.
The program basically gives you a
synthesiser front panel and allows you to

change parameters such as attack and
decay very simply as well as allowing you
to write tunes. The program isn't really
that bad my personal opinion is that it is
the incorrect one to be packaged with
the keyboard.
Verdict
The Commodore Sound Expander in
whatever form you purchase it can only
be described as superb. O K so I've
mentioned a few dislikes but it's good
qualities far outweigh those.
The keyboard and software reviewed
here was seen by  both professional
musicians and people who have never
touched a keyboard before, all were
equally impressed.
25
If you are thinking of  taking up
playing keyboards or would like to own
one but until now have been put off by
the price, dig deep and go and buy one
of the available systems, you're sure not
to regret it.

A SMALL NUMBER CAN BE
easily stored in a computer's
memory but most programs
use numbers which are out-
side t h e  range o f  simple
integers. Two by te integer
values can only include whole
numbers in the range of 32767
to -32768, so how doe Basic
deal w ith extremely large
numbers or decimals?
The system used is known
as ﬂoating point mathematics
or scientiﬁc notation. In the
decimal system of numbering
any number can be expressed
as a power of 10. For example,
the number 10 is represented
by 10 11 o r  1 x  10. O ne
hundred bec omes  1 0  t 2
which is 1 x  10 x 10 and a
thousand is 10 t 3 ( 1 x 1 0 x
10).
Numbers between mul-
tiples are represented in the
following ways:
20 x 10 1  (2 x 10 = 20)
3.52 ) 10 1 1 (3.52 x 10 = 35.2)
5.6798 x 10 I 2 (5.67 x 10 x 10 =
567,98)
You can see that convert-
ing a number to ﬂoating point
format means div iding i t
repeatedly by  10 until the
number is reduced to a value
between one and nine. Then
the number of divisions is
written down as a power of
10. This process is  called
'normalising the number,
Values below o n e  ar e
normalised b y  multiplying
them by 10 until the value lies
in the range one to nine, as
before. This time the number
of multiplications are repre-
sented as a negative value of
10:
0,1 becomes 1 x 10 1 -1
0.00521 becomes 5.21 x 10 - 3
In this form of notation 10 1 0
hds the value of one, so any
number from one to nine is
represented b y  a  number
multiplied by 10 1 0,
The t w o  parts o f  t h e
ﬂoating point number are
known as the mantissa and
the exponent. The mantissa is
the fractional number and the
exponent is the power of 10.
Because t h e  power  is
always a  power o f  10 the
computer uses the letter E
instead of printing 10 every
time:
1.243E15
By now you will realise
that t h e  decimal place is
detemined by the exponent.
The name 'ﬂoating point' is
derived from the fact that as
the exponent is increased and
decreased the decimal point
ﬂoats forwards and back-
wards along t h e  mantissa
when t h e  expression i s
converted to normal decimal
notation.
Binary Power
This is all very well but there's
a ﬂy  i n  t h e  ointment.
Computers u s e  b in a r y
notation not decimal. For-
tunately, the method is the
same but to base two.
We h a v e  s e e n  t h a t
normalising a  d e c im a l
26
number means converting
the number so that it  lies
between one and 10 or, to put
it another way, one and the
number base 10 minus one.
Applying this to binary base
two, a  normalised number
lies between one and the
number base two minus one.
So a  normalis ed binar y
number always has a  one
before the decimal point.
When reading a byte from
left to right the value of each
successive bit in decimal is
half of the previous bit in the
series 8, 4, 2, 1. This series
c ontinues  b e y o n d  t h e
decimal point so, since binary
one is  t h e  lowest whole
number in the series and it
equals one decimal, binary
0.1 is 0.5 decimal, binary 0.01
is 0.25 and 0.001 gives decimal
0.125.
Five bytes are used in
memory t o  store ﬂoating
point numbers. The ﬁrst byte
is the exponent and the fol-
lowing four bytes give the
mantissa.
The exponent lies in the
decimal range 127 to-12B but
this does not convert directly
from the binary byte. Instead
a binary value of zero means
that the number is also zero in
decimal. A decimal value of
one converts to a value of -
128, two is -127 and so on until
255 converts to +127. It follows
that a  real value of  129 is
equivalent to an exponent of
zero.
Prying Mantissas
The mantissa is not as straight
forward as at ﬁrst might seem
probable. T h e  ﬁrs t b y t e
assumes a n  im ag in ary
decimal point following the
highest bit of the byte. We
have discovered that any
normalised number has a
value greater than one but
less than two, so w e can
always assume t h at  t h e
highest bit of this byte will be
one. Using this fact, the com-
puter uses this bit to signify
positive a n d  n eg at ive

numbers. A one in this posi-
tion would mean a negative
number and a zero signiﬁes a
positive value.
If the stored values are
PEEKed an ordinary decimal
value would result. Mantissa
1 would return a value of 192.
To convert this to a mantissa
value we must ﬁrst evaluate
the high bit by ANDing the
location with 128. This gives
128 which means the bit is set
and the number represented
will be negative.
Next we must determine
the value of the rest of the
byte. ANDing with 127 will
elminate the ﬁrst bit and give
64. This is the ﬁrst decimal
place of the binary mantissa
and equates with a value of
0.5 decimal. The maximum
value ,which it could reach if
PEEKed is 127. This is almost
128 which is double 64. If we
divide our value by 128 we
therefore get 0.5.
What if the third highest
bit was set instead? ANDing
with 127 would give 32 and
dividing by 128 gives 0.25, so
the system seems to work.
This deals with Mantissa 1 and
we now go on to consider
Mantissa 2.
Imagine for the moment
that this whole byte was an
eight bit Mantissa 1 with only
the highest bit set. The value
would be 128. To make this
equal to 0.5 we divide by 256.
It can't be 0.5 in this position
so we must divide again by
128. Similarly, Mantissa 3 is
divided by 256, then again by
256 and ﬁnally by 128 to reveal
its decimal value. Mantissa 4 is
divided three times by 256
and once by 128.
This four-byte Mantissa
gives an accuracy of approx-
imately nine places which is
accurate enough for most
The exponent is a power
of two, ranging from -128 to
127:
2 1 128 =  3_9 x  1 0  1 -29
2 1 128 = 1.7 x 10 1 38
This gives the maximum
range o f  ﬂoating-point
integers.
Peeking Out
A program to reveal the value
of a  stored ﬂoating point
number would have to do
four things.
Firstly, ﬁnd where the
variable is located. Secondly,
evaluate t h e  exponent.
Thirdly, determine the sign of
the ﬁnal number and ﬁnally
calculate the Mantissa. The
following program does all of
this:

Functional Arrays
Deﬁned functions are also
stored as a kind of variable.
The ﬁrst two bytes are the
function name. The following
two bytes point to the actual
location o f  t h e function
deﬁnition i n  p ro g ram
memory. The location of the
variable used within t h e
function is pointed to by the
next two bytes. The location is
always w it h in  variab le
memory. The ﬁnal byte does
not signify anything and
remains at value zero.
Arrays are stored in an
area which begins where the
variable data ends. Where is
this? Well, how long is a piece
of string? The start position
depends ﬁrstly on how long
the program is and, secondly,
how many variables have
been deﬁned. A s a  new
variable is encountered by
the program, so the array
memory moves up by seven
bytes.
Arrays are as complex to
store a s  t h e y  a r e  t o
manipulate in a program. First
a header must b e created
then a block of memory is put
aside for all of the values
liable t o  b e created. The
actual format can be seen in
the tables at the end of this
article.
Obviously, a vast amount
of memory can be reserved
for arrays and when you
consider that this block has to
be moved up seven bytes
every t i m e a n  ordinary
variable is created, it is clear
that this could slow t h e
program noticeably. Some
computers lack the ability to
move the array area and all
variables must be initialised in
the ﬁrst few lines of a program
to obtain a ﬁxed point for the
start of arrays. Even though
this is not necessary on a
Commodore, i t  c a n  b e
prudent, i n  cases where
several arrays are used, to
initialise integer, ﬂoating
point, string variables with
zero or null values before
deﬁning arrays.  A l s o
remember t o deﬁne func-
tions at this point too.
Get Organised
You w i l l  n o w  s ee w h y
memory i s  wasted when
deﬁning variables so that they
all occupy seven bytes. I t
makes t h e  m o vin g  o f
variables a lot simpler if a
ﬁxed space has to be created
regardless o f  t h e variable
type. This is crucial to chip
memory management and
many mo re examples o f
reserved memory will be seen
in future articles a s w e
progress through all of the
computer's chips.

Gordon Hamlett looks at US]
[Gold's pocket money range.I
WHEN BUDG E T G AME S  FI RST A P -
peared, they tended to be poor versions
of Space Invaders and Pacman, written
in Basic and sold in newsagents and
garages with no product advertising and
very low company proﬁles. It did not
take lo n g  though f o r  t h e  major
companies to see that there was a place
in the market for games at a low price
and soon they were re-releasing their
old titles at a lower price in order to gain
an increased shelf life and proﬁt from
their products.
With this increased respectability, it
was always on the cards that US Gold,
one o f  Britain's largest software
distributors, would jump on the band-
wagon. Americana is the title of the US
Gold budget range. Nine titles have
been released for the C64 in the initial
launch and there is promise of some
titles in the future for the C-16. As you
would expect f r om U S G old, t h e
packaging is slick with clear, plastic cases
(unusual f o r  t h e  company) and a
uniform colour scheme of yellows, reds
and oranges. O ne o f  the criticisms
levelled against USGold hasalways been
that the product has been too highly
priced but I  don't think that many
people will be too disappointed if they
pay f2.99 for one of these titles.

higher price and some that have never
before seen light of day under a US Gold
label.
Pinball
Stamball is a pinball game that scrolls
over four screens_ You must knock
down 37 targets with ﬁve balls in order to
progress on to the next screen. There are
four sets of ﬂippers to manipulate and
you can "nudge" the machine a limited
number of times as you endeavour to
keep the ball in play. An unusual feature
is the two player option which is not as
you may think, a head to head confron-
tation, but one player controlling the
ﬂippers and the other the nudges. I
Found this game highly addictive, and
my favourite amongst the titles released
so far.
Adventuring
Scrolls of Abadon is an arcade adventure
that at ﬁrst sight looks like a Pacman
derivative but there is a lot more to it
than that. You must explore a series of
rooms searching for the four pieces of
all the gems that are lying around whilst
avoiding the nasties. The more you
move round the screen, the more you
restrict your future movements as by
picking up the gems, you put down

R e v i e w s
some directional arrows that must be
followed. There are also scrolls to collect
that contain spells to help you on your
way.
Arcadia
011ie's Follies is a one or two player, 24
screen platform game, reminiscent of a
cut down version of Bounty Bob. On
each screen, you must collect a key and
make your way to the exit whiilst leaping
around the various obstacles. Robots
pursue you relentlessly although if you
pick up an object, you have a limited
amount of  time in which to destroy
them. There is the usual selection of
teleports, lif t s  a n d  lasers t o  b e
overcome.
Moon Shuttle is a space shoot-em-up
game in which you battle your way through
alternate screens of marauding aliens
and asteroid belts. There are several
varieties of aliens including blob men,
expandos, and bomb launchers. Vier
asteroid belt is solid and you blast a way
for your ship to pass safely through it. At
higher levels, t h e  asteroids mov e
considerably faster.
Another space arcade game is
Neutral Zone where you are in charge of
a perimeter gunnery pod. trying t o
defend your early warning station Alpha
IV. You are given warning as to which
direction t h e  nex t enemy s hip i s

approaching fr om and must tr y  t o
destroy it as quickly as possible. There
are ﬁve difﬁculty levels to choose from
and your score is determined not only
by the number of enemies that you
destroy, but also the length of time that
you took to do it.
Street Life
New York City is a strange sort of game
where the object is to go round visiting
various sights such as the Empire State
Building and the city Zoo. You can drive
round the city or walk or use the subway.
You will need to eat and get money from
the bank in order to pay for your car
repairs etc. At alit hese locations, there is
a platform type game to solve before
you are allowed to proceed. If you crash
your car, you get taken to the hospital
whilst the car goes to the garage and all
of the costs time and money. The entire
game must b e completed within a
certain time period.
All Sorts
Shamus is a Beserk type game which sees
you trying to penetrate the Shadow's lair
and destroy him. You must explore the
mazes searching for colour coded keys
that allow you access to further levels.
All this must be done whilst defending
yourself against the assorted intruders.
29
There are extra lives to be gained either
by collecting bottles o r  b y  risking
walking over a question mark and there
is the continual threat of the shadow to
be overcome - he can't be killed, only
stunned if he comes chasing after you.
Sentinel is a Start Trek/Star Raiders
variant. A map of the stellar grid displays
both friendly and enemy forces and you
must w ar p i n t o  t h e  appropriate
quadrant to do battle with the foe in an
arcade type sequence. There are long
and short range scanners to help you
ﬁnd the enemy and you must navigate
through asteroid ﬁelds as you travel in
hyperspace to your destination_ You
must also ﬁnd friendly bases where you
can dock, refuel and rearm.
The ﬁnal game to be released is
Breakdance. In this you can select from
four different variants as you try to prove
to rival gangs that you are a better
dancer than they are, This involves
watching the computer opponent make
a move and then copying it. If you get
that right, you get a sequence of two
moves to reproduce, then threee, then
four and so on, Yes, it's no more than a
variant of Simon, one of the ﬁrst ever
electronic games. This one's only likely
to appeal to dance fans.
Well, there you have it. Nine games,
none o f  them really had and a ll
representing good value for money.
Yet another winner from US Cold.

Blil Bremner gets in al
spin  with his disk 1
drive.
EAST FORMATTERS HAVE
been commonplace on the
C64 ever since the 1541 was
added to the growing range
of peripherals. Almost every
function to do with the 1541
seems to be synonymous with
a snail, and the standard 1.5
minute ' N O : "  F O RMAT
routine does little to help.
However, i f  the format
routine is studied in depth,
the reason for this sluggish-
ness is made clear. There is a
trade-off point in disk drives
between speed and reliabi-
lity: t h e  faster y ou mak e
operations such as data trans-
fer and read/write operations,
the larger the chance of data
errors. The format routine
used in the1541 is designed to
divide the disk surface into
tracks and sectors, supplying
a working area that allows the
Disk Operating System selec-
tive data storage. Gaps are
supplied between sectors and
sector headers to allow for
variations in the drive motor
speed.
However, individual 1541s
often run at different speeds,
and although the difference is
very s mall, occasionally
problems arise due to sector
over/under-writing. C o m-
modore originally opted to
use a ﬁxed length gap bet-
ween the end of one sector
and the start of another (DOS
1-0), but this eventually lead
to read and write errors. Later
versions of DOS formatting
(Including the 1541) were re-
written t o  allow for  these
speed ﬂuctuations, achieved
by writing a unique series of
marks along a track.
These marks are timed and
the results are divided by the
number o f  sectors o n the
track to calculate the tail gap
length. The same track is then
re-erased, formatted a n d
veriﬁed. This results in each
track passing under  t h e
read/write head about 10
times, or two seconds.
Obviously, by-passing the
timing routine and inserting a
single constant for all the tail
gaps o n  t h e  dis k  would

reduce the formatting time by
about half. By cutting out this
routine various fast format-
ters (that includes fast copiers
with b u ilt  i n  formatters)
achieve their  high speed,
however they often take out
the verify routine as well.
Using a  formatter whic h
calculates the tail gap is more
reliable simply due to the fact
that t h e  format is  biased
towards the performance of
your drive.
The format routine I have
written c ut s  d o w n  t h e
formatting time by calculat-
ing the tail gap only when a
new Zone barrier is reached.
The way the DOS format
routine works makes it easy
for us to insert a simple patch.
The FORMAT r outine a t
$CBC6 sets up a N I' $1- AC7 in
buffer tr 3  ($0600), a n d
activates f o r ma t t in g  b y
storing an EXECUTE (SEO) Job
Code in $0003, providing for
continuous monitoring of the
writing.
What we have to do is
copy the ﬁrst part of the set-
up at SFAC7 into a buffer
unused dur ing formatting.
We can then insert a small
machine-code r outine t o
check what track the head is
on, and if it's the start of a
Zone continue where the
original c o d e  l e f t  o f f .
Otherwise, the routine JMPs
straight to the track format
routine at SFC36, by-passing
the timing section.
A " U C : "  (JMP $0500)
command is used to activate
the routine inside the drive
RAM, as well as providing a
similar structure to the "NO:"
command, to eliminate the
disk n a m e / i d  p a r s in g
problems.
Good luck, and be careful
when typing in the program
since hitting a wrong key is
one of the commonest errors
which amateur typists make!

improves the C-16's
'hi-res memory.
AS EVERY C- 16 OWNER
knows only too well, when the
c omputer  i s  i n  h i g h
resolution mode only 2K is
available for Basic. This article
shows h o w  t h e  available
memory c an b e  doubled
using assorted trickery.
When the hi-res screen is
in use, the low-res screen is of
course not needed unless you
use the split screen option in
GRAPHIC modes 2  and 4.
Therefore i t  s hould b e
possible to overwrite this low-
res memory area when using
the hi- r es  s c reen. T h e
problem is that when you are
writing the program to run on
the hi-res screen you need to
use the low-res screen!
So, in  theory, it  is  not
possible t o  have a  hi-res
screen with colour and attri-
butes w ithout a  low-res
screen. This also means that
you only get a miserable 2K
for Basic.
The Method
The method we are going to
use for 4K involves a machine
code routine which moves
the Basic u p  and d o w n
depending on whether or not
you are in the hi-res mode.
The memory maps for each
mode are shown in the two
sections of Figure 1.
This method works on the
principle that, although it is
necessary to have complete
hi-res and low-res screens,
because only one screen is
displayed at a time, it does not
matter if the Basic is moved
down into the low-res screen
memory w hen t h e  hi-res
screen is active, and up into
the colour and luminance
memory of the hi-res screen
when the low-res screen is
active. T h e  pr ogr am i s
therefore moved down and
up by 2048 bytes.
But why  n o t  simply
move the 2K hi-res colour and
luminance maps down into
the low-res screen and attri-
butes block ? In theory this
should work (the Commod-
ore-64 uses the low-res area
for the hi-res colours when in
hi-res mode) as it is possible
to move the colours and attri-
butes t a b le  a r o u n d  b y
POKEing bits 3 to 7 of register
PROGRAMMING!
THE
65300 (SFF14 hex) with the top
5 bits of the high byte of the
address of the table.
In effect this enables the
position of the table to be in
any 2K block starting at OK,
2K, 4K etc. Note that because
of the way that the C-16 inter-
rupt service routine continu-
ally rePOKEs this address this
address with the value stored
in $07F13, it is more effective to
POKE bits 3 to 7 of address
$07F13 (2043 decimal, the 'VM
base mask for split screen')
while in hi-res. Although the
2K colour+luminance area
does move with this POKE, hi-
res c ommands  s uc h a s
CIRCLE, DRAW, SCNCLR and
BOX still think the colour and
luminance maps are stored in
their o l d  positions. T his
means that the hi-res Basic
commands still address the 2K
block starting at 6144, over-
writing any program stored in
this area.
Thus, although i t  is  i n
theory possible to merge the
low-res screen and hi-res
colour-Fluminance maps
together. the C16 does not
allow you to use any of its
Basic c ommands . T h is
method would still work with
machine c o d e  programs
though, and also means that
the code would not have to
be r e- loc atable a s  t h e
program would not have to
move.
As this method would be
useful to machine coders, the
memory map of the system is
shown in Figure 2. Note the
resemblance this system has
to the C64 memory layout for
the hi-res screen. It could
prove useful in adapting C64
machine code programs on to
the C-16.
The o t h e r  'pos s ible'
method o f  getting ex tra
memory would be to move
the low-res screen and attri-
butes u p  in t o  t h e  hi-res
screen colour and luminance
34

ables. This should be poss-
ible by POKE65300.24 while in
ow-res mode - although for
this to work the machine's
own interrupt service routine
has to be disabled ﬁrst. Un-
fortunately, again the C-16 still
attempts to use the low-res
screen at 2048 and writes to
that ar ea m a k in g  y o u r
program look like a Chinese
Takeaway menu card. You
could use this method for
machine code I suppose, but I
can't s ee any  partic ular
advantages with it.
So the only way of getting
4K for Basic appears to be to
move the program u p  o r

down whenever you want the
low-res or hi-res screens.
A bit of a mess? Not really
as it is now possible to use the
hi-res GSHAPE and SSHAPE
commands f o r  ins tanc e
(which can occupy up to 256
bytes per shape) and still have
room f o r  a  us eful Basic
program. With only  2K o f
memory there was not much
point i n  h a v in g  t h e s e

C-1 6 As s embler  w h i c h
appears in the June 1985 issue
of Your Commodore, If you
haven't got this assembler up
and running, the code is in
DATA statements in Figure 4,
Type this in and RUN to POKE
the code into memory.
The routine occupies 230
bytes starting at $0600 (5136
decimal) i n  a  portion o f
memory not used by the C-16.
This space is not available to
Plus-4 owners, b u t  they
wouldn't need t o  d o  this
memory juggling anyhow,
would they?.
The Program
The program contains three
routines: (1) set the top of
Basic pointer to 8191 to have
4K of Basic, (2) move Basic
down 2048 bytes to go into hi-
res mode, and (3) move Basic
up to 4096 again to go into
low-res mode.
The 's et pointers t o  4 K'
routine is  at address 1698
($06A2).
The ' mo v e  Basic d o w n '
routine is  at address 1536
($0600).
The 'move Basic up' routine is
at address 1618 ($0652).
Now follows a line-by-line
explanation of the program
so everyone can marvel at just
how clever it all is!
Explanation
Lines 11000-11480 hold the
MOVBASICDOWN routine.
Lines 11000-11160 set the old
and n e w  s tar t o f  Basic
pointers f o r  t h e  relocate
routine at lines 11200-11250.
$D0-$D1 contains the old start
at 4096 ($1001), and SD"-$D3
contains the new start at 2048
($0800).
Lines 11200-11250 move the
Basic down one page (256
bytes) at a time calling the
BLOCKMOVE routine at line
12000 to actually move each
256 byte block.
Lines 11270-11280 set a vector
for subtracting from the high
byte of the pointers (such as
the start o f  Basic pointer),
setting it to $ 8  as in thiscase
means that the pointers will
move down 2K (in the start of
Basic pointer example, the
pointer w ill change fr om
$1000 to $0800).
Lines 11285 sets the start of
Basic for the line link address
changing to 50800 (2048. the
new start of Basic).
Lines 11290 calls the 'Relocate
line links' routine (RE) at line
14000.
Lines 11300-11478 change all
the relevant system pointers
so that the machine can carry
on as usually whether the
whole o f  Basic has been
moved up or down. Note that
this code is  used b y  the
MOVEBASICUP routine (line
11500) also.
Lines 11300-11390 change all
the pointers that are between
$26 and $38 using a machine
FIGURE 3
code loop. T he pointers
changed are:
The 'start of Basic test' pointer
at $2B-$2C.
The 'start of Basic variables'
pointer at $2D-52E.
The 'start of Basic arrays' and
•end o f  Bas ic  arrays+1'
pointers at $2F-$30 and $31 -
$32 respectively.
The ' b o t t o m o f  s trings '
pointer at $33-$34.
The utility string pointer at
$36-$36.
The 'highest address used by
Basic' pointer at $37438.
35
Lines 11400-11478 change all
the other pointers at  o ld
places in memory.
Lines 11400-11425 change the
'current DATA item address
pointer' at $41442.
Lines 11430-11438 change the
'current Basic variable data'
pointer at $47-$48.
Lines 11440-11470 change the
'Text pointer' at $3B-$3C.
Lines 11472-11478 change the
'OPPIR' pointer at $4B-$4C.
Lines 11480 then jumps to the
'RELOCATE STRING LINKS'
(RS) routine at line 16000.

the 'MOVE BASIC UP' and
'MOVE BASI C  D O W N '
routines.
Lines 14000-14340 ar e t he
'RELOCATE LIN E LINKS'
routine (each line of Basic has
a two byte link pointer which
points t o  the next line of
Basic).
All these links must be altered
when Basic is relocated).
Lines 14050-14060 set the 'low

pointer to 1, so that the start
of Basic is at 4097 or 2049 (the
ﬁrst byte at 4096 or 2049 must
be 0).

to line 14090 to change the
next line link only if the new
link address is not zero, if it is
zero then the end of Basic has
been reached and line 14340
returns from the routine.
Lines 15000-15100 are the 'set

routine.
Lines 15100-15160 store the
new end of Basic (VHF or
8191 decimal) in the 'bottom

Return. Note that as this
routine is jumped to last of all,
the RTS returns to Basic to
resume execution.
Lines 16300-16320 check t o
see if the ﬁrst byte of the
name o f  the variable has
+128 added to it, if it has it is
not a string variable and it
jumps to line 16500.
Lines 16350-16370 check t o
see if the second byte of the
name of the variable has +128
added to it. If it hasn't then it
is not a string variable and it
jumps to line 16500. If all the
conditions for a string var-
iable are met however, the
high byte of the string link
address is altered to its new
value in lines 16400-16440.
Lines 16500-16550 advance

Lines 16560-16570 jump t o
analyse the next variable.
Demo
Figure 5  shows a  s hor t
demonstration pr ogr am.
Lines 100-120 are really pro-
tection instructions. This is
necessary because, if the C-16'
encounters an error in the
program it will switch back to
low-res mode and print the
error on the screen, so over-
writing your Basic program.
These instructions however
36
overcome the problem. A
TRAP is set up so that when
the C-16 encounters an error it
goes to line 110 to do all the
necessary moving up of Basic
etc, so that your program is
not overwritten. Line 110
selects low-res and moves
Basic back up again to 4096, if
it was located at 2048 when
the error was encountered.
Line 120 prints the error along
with the line number of the
error and then ENDs. Note
the GOTO in line 100 points
to where the actual program
starts.
Because of the complexity
involved in relocating, it is not
possible to use string arrays
when this system is working,
although you can use normal
variables, strings, and integer
and ﬂoating point variable
arrays. This should not prove
much of a problem though,
and I can assure you that it
would take a lot more work
and code to overcome this
limitation.
The ﬁrst long awaited
application should be a hi-res
program which also includes
GSHAPE and SSHAPE f o r
cutting and pasting on the
screen etc. and I  hope a
reader will write one and
send it to be published in this
magazine. Unfortunately it is
not possible t o  SAVE your
artwork at the moment, as
going into the monitor to save
the code for the hi-res screen
would bring you back into
low-res and so overwrite the
colour and luminance tables
of t h e  hi-res  screen. A
suitable save routine will be
presented as part of a future
article in this series.
I hope these routines have
proved interesting and you
will soon be on the way with
hi-res StarTreks, Elites and
other Basic hi-res epics on the
massive 4K C-16.

CHALLENGING FASi AOION
with s uperb background
graphics are a feature of this
shoot 'em u p  space game
from Bug-Byte.
In part one you have to
pilot a  craft across various
landscapes blasting every-
thing that appears on the
screen, dodging and weaving
to avoid collision with your
prey. T h e  bac k gr ound
animation looks stunning as it
scrolls in sympathy with the
movement of the spacecraft.
011o II is equally as chal-
lenging but has more purpose
to t he game. I t  bears an
incredible resemblance t o
THIS G AME BASED O N
Channel 4  and Yorkshire
Television's Countdown will
appeal to anyone who ﬁnds
anagrams and arithmetic
absorbing.
The game is split into three
principle parts. T h e  ﬁrst
allows y ou t o  select nine
letters nominating eac h
selection as a  vowel o r  a
consonant. When complete,
both players have 30 seconds
to extract the longest possible
word from the selection of
letters and t he one w h o
makes the longest word gains
a point for each letter.
The second type of game
allows one of the players to
Alligata's Z but I shan't hold
that against it.
As you pilot your ship over
an alien complex you are shot
at and rammed by  enemy
craft and gun emplacements.
You must try to eliminate the
power supplies and guns of
the complex to win a round.
This catapults your craft into a
space battle bonus screen and
then b a c k  t o  a n o t h e r
complex which is even more
dangerous t h a n  t h e  o n e
before.
Otherwise the games are
traditional k ill or  be killed
programs with the distinction
of high resolution backdrops.
ED.
select a series of numbers. At
this point the computer takes
over generates a  random
number. Both players then
have another 30 seconds to
devise a  s imple for mula
which will result in a number
as close as possible to the
computer's number . T he
person with the nearest value
is awarded the points.
The ﬁnal type of game is
the Countdown Conundrum.
A problem with this game
is that all of the characters are
left on the screen. This makes
cheating a distinct possibility,
so play fair.
ED.
WITH THE CROWD BAYING
for blood, you ﬂick the red
cape that you're carrying and
stand your ground as the bull
comes charging towards you.
At the last moment, you lift
the cape clear allowing the
bull to pass underneath. Un-
fortunately, y ou misjudge
things slightly and Alfonso,
the bovine beast, tosses you
casually round the arena until
your body can take no more
punishment and the stretcher
bearers have t o  carry you
away to hospital.
That just about sums up
the game. You attempt to get
the bull to pass underneath
your cape as often as possible
whilst he tries to gore you to
death. If you are successful
enough, the crowd throws a
ring into the arena which you
must endeavour to place on
Alfonso's horns. If you are
quick e n o u g h  o n  y o u r
joystick when you are tossed,
you can land on the bull's
back and r ide him rodeo
fashion for extra points.
Given that the whole idea
of bullﬁghting is particularly
unsavoury and that the game
itself has  f e w  redeeming
qualities, I can ﬁnd no reason
to recommend it, even at the
price_ There are many better
budget games on the market.

MAX HEADROOM, CO M-
puter generated presenter
extraordinaire, started life in a
movie bearing his name. The
game is a blend of the con-
ceited Max of Channel 4 and
the plot of the ﬁlm.
The story follows the plot
of the ﬁlm very closely but
this does  n o t  s poil t h e
entertainment value. Max
Headroom i s  t o  b e  t h e
presenter of a video show
which will include an insid-
ious advertising technique
known as the 'blipvert' which
has a nasty side effect. Certain
people viewing these ads will
explode!
Such behaviour cannot be
tolerated and Edison has been
chosen to recover the Max
Module fr om t he massive
NET23 skyscraper. Intelli-
gence sources have revealed
that the module is hidden in
the laboratory behind a
complex security system.
Some of the security codes
have been retrieved from the
NET23 computer. These allow
Edison to reach all but the top
two levels above the 200th
ﬂoor. The code for the lab
situated on Level 210 is in the
Presidential Suite on the ﬂoor
above and the code for the
Suite is  i n  t h e  Director's
ofﬁces somewhere o n  the
ﬂoors below.
A door locking mecha-
nism is in operation which
must be breached if Edison is
to succeed and the ﬂoors are
patrolled by vicious robots.
Quite a challenge.
The lift security requires
the operator t o  keep the
single character code lit on an
LCD display for a ﬁxed time
period. T his  is  done b y
sending a small voltaer alone
the wires which connect to
the correct elements of the
display. T h e  capacitance
effect decays after a while and
the elements  m u s t  b e
refreshed regularly or the lift
will go out of control and
plunge you t o  one of  the
lower ﬂoors.
Once on the ﬂoor of your
choice Edison is controlled by
icons on each side of  the
screen. Your ﬁrst task is to
switch off the door locking
mechanism by a Simon style
game in which you have to
play a randomly generated
series of four tones back in
reverse order.
At t h e  same time the
robots will be homing in on
you, guns blazing. Edison can
withstand a certain number of
hits but he may have to rest to
recover from his injuries if he
is badly weakened. This is
where t h e  t im e  element
comes into play.
Once he has located the
four codes o n  t h e  ﬂoors
between Level 200 and 209 by
searching each room in turn,
he can gain access t o the
Presidential Suite to ﬁnd the
code for the Lab. He can then
locate the Max Module and
rendezvous in the basement
for the end of his mission.
At this  point y ou ar e
incited to load side two of the
tape where an animated Max
waits to speak a synthesised
message to you. I would have
preferred sub-titles to comp-
lement the speech synthesis
because much of what he says
borders on the unintelligible.
It is still a convincing piece of
programming.
The game looked far more
challenging than it turned out
to be. I completed it in only
an hour or two with two com-
puter hours to spare. Just, to
test this wasn't beginner's
luck I tried again (twice) with
similar results. With a  few
modiﬁcations this could be a
great game but as it stands
does n o t  represent good
value for money.
For example, i f  Edison
quickly cracks the door lock
code for the ﬁrst ﬂoor he can
hide in one of the rooms and
cracks all the codes for the
other ﬂoors. It would have
been more challenging if a
ﬂoor code could only  b e
cracked o n  t h e  Level i n
question w it h  t h e  robots
bearing down on him. This
would necessitate running
the gauntlet of robots and
ﬁnding a breathing space to
gain time to unlock the doors.
There are a few random
problems lik e  t h e  man-
hunters Mahler and Breugel
who roam the ﬂoors, but this
presented no real threat and
most of the other problems,
code changes and something
nasty in  the lab, failed t o
appear.
The graphics and music
are excellently integrated to
give a feeling of excitement
and the lift sequence is simple
but extremely effective. Pity
the g a m e  i s  n o t  m o r e
challenging.

AMERICAN F O O T BALL
seems to be all the rage at the
moment. The strategems and
showbiz glamour of the sport
are gradually being absorbed
into our culture. One day its
popularity may  reach t h e
same degree o f  fanaticism
which accompanies rugby or
soccer today.
Ariolasoft has  resisted
jumping on this bandwagon
too soon and consequently
this game is far more intelli-
gible t o  the British market
than other computer simula-
tions that I have seen.
Compromises have had to
be made to allow the sport to
be successfully portrayed.
The rows  o f  cheerleaders
have been reduced to a single
performer and t h e  team
consists of just six players per
side.
The game options allow a
two player tournament, man
versus machine or a demo
mode. The length of play can
be ﬁve, 10 or 15 minutes per
quarter.
Strategies are selected by
joystick while the two sides
are down in a huddle. The
menu for the defending side
consists of a choice of nine
formations b u t  offence is
more complex.
The attacking side must
decide the plays for  team
formation, two pass patterns
and line blocking. If a kick is
chosen, a  n e w  series o f
options is revealed allowing
three types of kick.
Only one of your players is
controlled by the joystick but
he may pass the ball to one of
two other players depending
on the chosen pass pattern.
Assuming the player can gain
positional advantage without
being brought down by an
opponent, he can pass the
ball to one of his forwards.
When the ball is thrown, the
receiver becomes the one
controlled by the joystick. If
the receiver catches (snaps)
the ball successfully he must
gain as  muc h ground as
possible before a tackle is
made on him.
While all this is going on
the rest of the team should be
successfully occupying t h e
other members of the oppos-
ition but this only works if the
correct blocking counter has
been chosen.
As play progresses down
the ﬁeld y ou must decide
whether to kick for goal or go
for a touchdown. As in rugby,
the scores are higher for a
touchdown than for a kick.
Successful touchdowns are
rewarded with a chance to
convert your score with a kick
at goal.
The game is complex and
contrasts w it h  t h e  rather
crude s c r olling o f  t h e
graphics b u t  such is  t h e
drawing power of the game
you h a r d ly  n o t ic e  t h is
deﬁciency after the ﬁrst few
minutes.
As a n  opponent t h e
computer i s  for midable
though n o t  in f a llib le _
Although I didn't succeed in
defeating the other team I
always felt that I'd blown my
chance rather than feeling
helplessly overrun_
The ins tr uc tions  a r e
thankfully clear and despite
the fact that my review copy
was accompanied b y  t h e
original IBM PC game manual
I managed to fathom it all out.
I hope that the CM book is a
little mor e informative, a
glossary of terms could help.
Plays ar e often indiv i-
dually devised according to
the team's strategist so there
is a series of diagrams explain-
ing the mode of action which
each play  involves. Using
these w it h  t h e  gameplay
helps you to anticipate where
the receiving player will be at
any particular time while the
play is still on.
Careless players will run
back out of range of both of
his receivers. This is indicated
by a loud buzz when you
attempt a pass. The only way
out is to run forward and try
to dodge the tackles of your
opponents. This is not easy.
A kick can be blocked if
your strategy is  correctly
chosen and your players are
quick off the mark. The idea
being to gain possession of
the ball and then hang On to it
as long as possible.
Watching y our  strategy
pay off is extremely satisfying
and when things go wrong
the game becomes totally
absorbing. Devotees of the
game may cringe at the limit-
ations o f  the program and
those who don't know the
game may  feel overfaced.
Don't let this put you off, this
game is great entertainment
and y ou always have your
hands full (hopefully with the
ball).

KARATE C 6 4 / 1 2 8
r
WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED A
copy o f  System 3's  latest
game, International Karate,
my immediate reaction was
"Oh no, not another martial
arts game!".
As a game, International
Karate plays in a similar, if
obviously superior way t o
Exploding Fist. In one player
option. you must ﬁght against
a computer opponent in a
series o f  30 second bouts.
Each t im e  y ou beat t h e
opponent three times your
standard of belt is increased,
although I  doubt i f  many
people will ever see black
belt!
As w ell as  t he purely
ﬁghting parts, System 3 has
included two different sec-
tions to test your control of
the game. The ﬁrst of these
tests involves smashing bricks
with your head, which is fun if
a little futile! Secondly, and
much more difﬁcult, is a test
which involves jumping,
ducking a n d  gener ally
avoiding a series of weapons
which ﬂy towards you.
Priced a t  £6.50, Inter-
national Karate can only be
viewed as excellent value for
money, and it is a game that
no self respecting arcade fan
should miss.

STRICT ORDERS HAVE BEEN
given. Your mission: to seek
out and recover a valuable
batch o f  pods , scattered
around a mysterious and dan-
gerous network of caverns.
The pods are protected by
missile bases which have to be
destroyed.
Once you have a pod, the
task is to zoom to the top of
the screen and return it to the
atmosphere where you will
be rewarded with completion
points.
In theor y , t h e  game
appears to be very easy but
don't be misled by the ﬁrst
two missions. The ﬁrst mission
merely involves shooting one
rather sleepy missile base,
picking u p  t h e  p o d  a n d
thrusting back to the top of
the screen.
On eac h mission, fuel
supplies a r e  r a n d o m ly
scattered and you need to
collect as many as possible if
you ar e t o  succeed. T he
further y ou proceed t h e
longer the caverns become
and w it h  f u e l bec oming
scarce you need to collect all
the supplies that are available
in t h e  o p e n in g  stages.
Sometimes the fuel banks are
located next to the missile
bases and trying to shoot one
and not the other can be a
real challenge.
The ﬁrst encounter of real
difﬁculty occurs in the third
stage. You must guide your
trusty and rather frail looking
ship through a  large and
winding cavern that tends to
bend at extremely difﬁcult
angles. There ar e several
more missile bases to cope
with and less fuel to be found
but lifting the pod out of the
cavern is , at ﬁrst, quite a
daunting task. It will take you
several attempts to master this
stage but Thrust's addictive
qualities will give you that
vital incentive needed t o
progress.
The missions that follow
this are far more difﬁcult and
your task becomes mor e
complex. The cavers become
huge and to gain access to
certain areas a special button
must b e  h i t  causing t h e
previously locked entrances
to slide open. One piece of
adv ice here is to not be too
hesitant w h e n  pas s ing
through the newly opened
area, as the entrances soon
close again and ﬁnding your-
self being crushed to death is
not very pleasant.
Thrust is not as graphically
stunning a s  t h e  arc ade
original Gravitar but it does
feature some nice music and a
satisfactory standard of sound
effects. T h e  caverns a r e
visually good as are the gem-
like pods.
One excellent feature of
the game is  t h e  superb
response o f  the keyboard,
allowing sensitive control of
the ship. Manoeuvring in the
caverns can be very difﬁcult
in certain situations but this
can b e  o v e r c o m e  b y
mastering the thrust control.
Thrust a n d  dexterity ar e
essential once you have at-
tached the pod to the base of
your ship. If you travel too fast
then t h e  p o d  w i l l  sway
causing its weight to drag you
into the walls and instant
oblivion. Travelling too slow
will result in the pod dragging
your ship down to the ﬂoor of
the cavern and, once again,
immediate death amidst a ball
of ﬂames. If you do manage to
guide the pod out of the
cavern it is a simple task to
zoom upwards to the top of
the screen where you will be
rewarded with points for the
completion of the mission.
There a r e  numer ous
missions t o  c o m p le t e ,
another contributing factor
to the gamets vast appeal. The
argument that budget price
software reﬂects the game
will certainly be invalid in this
case. Alt hough prev ious
budget software has often
been of poor quality and of a
far too difﬁcult standard, this
one should not be missing
from a n y  serious games
player's collection,
An interesting situation
could arise if  Mastertronic
follows u p  Thr us t w i t h
another game o f  s imilar
appeal. It would increase the
grip of budget software on
the g a m e s  m a r k e t ,  a
circumstance that could put
the frighteners on the big
guns forcing them to drop the
price of their so-called 'better
software'.
At present I  could not
think o f  a  better way o f
spending 0.99, so go out and
buy it, I guarantee you won't
be dis appointed i n  t h e
slightest.

THE RETURN OF
ROCKMAN
Mastertronic £1.99 C-16 + Joystick
21r.
AFTER SEEING ROCKMAN,
the Return of Rockman ﬁlled
me w it h  antic ipation o f
another ex c iting search
through rock ﬁlled caverns in
the diamond mine. I  was
disappointed.
The caverns are complex
enough but the game is let
down badly b y  the jerky
animation which drove my
eyes crazy. Rockman is a cute
little character who inhabits a
very dangerous world. His
passion for diamonds is the
only thing that keeps him
going i n  a  never-ending
search_
The skill of the game lies in
your ability t o  reach t he
diamonds without blocking
your own path with rocks or
falling foul of the fast moving
hazards. Speed of action and
thought a r e  t h e  s k ills
required. Delay too long and
tons of rock will descend on
Rockman's pate, killing him
outright, move too quickly
and falling boulders w ill
block y o u r  w a y  t o  t h e
diamonds.
Why the screen should
jerk around so much instead
of scrolling gently is a mystery
to me. I admit that it adds to
the difﬁculty of the game but
it also puts a n  incredible
strain on the eyes.
E.D.
VIC-20 OWNERS PREPARE
yourself for a treat. Rarely do
we have good news for you
but at least Jeff Minter has not
forgotten you.
Ever s inc e h e  formed
Llamasoft in the early days his
games have attracted a lot of
attention. in many ways the
games market owes a lot to
Minter's innovative experi-
mentation i n  the develop-
ment o f  t h e  sophisticated
games we see today. His taste
is in the realms of fast action
but his techniques have been
applied i n  many  different
areas.
Andes Attack was going to
be a version of Defender but
was c hanged t o  a v o id
possible litigation with Atari.
It also hailed the start o f
Minter's preoccupation with
Peru and gave vent to his love
of that country's wildlife
especially the llamas.
With Traxx he may have
painted the town read but
certainly this became the pre-
dominant c olour  o n  t h e
monitor screen. Based o n
another arcade game, i n
Traxx you are pursued around
a grid by as many as nine Evil
Bugs. Your aim is to encircle
each square of the grid which
then turns red. If you capture
the c or ner  squares, t h e
hunters become the hunted
as you race around the screen
gobbling up the Bugs.
Gridrunner was the game
which really showed Minter's
mastery o f  t h e  medium.
Twenty waves o f  very fast
action in a mere 3.5K is quite
an achievement especially as
it only took a week to write!
A Centipede-like creature
is threatening your space grid
and the humanoids under
your protection. Your aim is
to blast each centipede out of
existence with your plasma
gun but a hit causes it to split
into two parts, doubling the
threat. T w o  enemy  c raft
patrol the edge of the grid
and you also have to avoid
their bolts while you battle
on.
Laser Zone places you in
control of two cannon which
THE VIC 20 COLLECTION
run along two rails running at
right angles to one another
like the X-Y axes of a graph,
Aliens attack towards the rails
with ever increasing deter-
mination and you must co-
ordinate t he position and
direction of  your ﬁring to
protect each gun. Often this
means using o n e  gun t o
protect the other in a state of
absolute panic.
Matrix is  a n expanded
version of Gridrunner and,
like some of the other games,
needs at least 8K expansion.
The action is even faster than
the o r ig in a l g a m e  a n d
features many  mor e e m -
bellishments.
Metagalactic Llamas sold
not solely on the strength of
the game but equally on its
rather eye catching title. It
was to be the forerunner of
Minter's long dalyance with
the ungulate breeds in his
forays into the C64 market.
Genetic manipulation has
led to the development of
MetaLlamas which spit laser
beams at the spider hordes of
the Evil Empire. If one of these
Cyborg ar c hnid mutants
manages to land on the planet
at the Edge of Time, it changes
into a Weeviloid which crawls
towards t h e  llama. O n ly
skillful ricocheting o f  laser
spit from the sides of the
screen can save the llama
now.
Like most Minter games
this collection represents
almost p u r e  s hoot ' e m
excitement. I always get the
feeling t h a t  h e  uses t h e
human race as guinea pigs for
his experimentation w it h
gameplay techniques. Playing
them is like doing some sort
of ability test. This is  not
surprising bec aus e J e f f
genuinely loves his  games
and tends to write for his own
enjoyment rather than for
pure proﬁt Its fortunate for
him that his love of fast action
is in tune with so many game
players around the world.
I w ould n o t  say that
Minter appeals to everyone's
taste but love him or loathe
him you can't ignore him. E.D.

KICKING THE DRUG HABIT
is rightly gaining a lot of pub-
licity lately. In this game you
get a chance to kick the men
behind the pushers. A drugs
ring i n  Columbia, South
America, has kidnapped a
friend and your newspaper
has given you the chance to
rescue him. In return you can
help t o  smash the ring by
hunting out the answers to 32
burning questions.
The paramilitary members
of the ring are holed up in a
sprawling HQ complex where
room upon room harbours
clues to the ring's operations.
This stronghold has  been
breached by a team of secret
agents (NEXUS) who will help
you to search the building for
these clues and to ﬁnd your
friend, Tayo.
Long pas s ages  a n d
c omplex  l i f t  n e t w o r k s

of the complex but each ﬂoor
requires a  special c olour
coded pass card which the
NEXUS c rew w ill happily
supply. Without the correct
card you must rely on your
skills in karate and on any
weapons y ou c an ﬁnd t o
defeat the enemy hordes.
A speciﬁc member o f
Nexus can be contacted via a
computer location system.
The blue personnel c om-
puters may be found in one of
the many  rooms o n  t h e
various levels. Held in the
databases are details of all the
NEXUS personnel. Most are
forgery experts b u t  three
have special skills. Fiona can
tell you where to ﬁnd hand
grenades. Paul is an informer
and can point you towards a
speciﬁc clue and the other
specialist can show you where
the stun guns are hidden.
To h i d e  t h e i r  t r u e
identities t h e  agents must
behave like the ring's guards.
If your pass is invalid they will
attack you unless you reveal
your identity with a special
greeting. Even Tay o w ill
attack if you fail to greet him.
It's a  tough world i n  the
complex.
All commands are issued
via t h e  joystick. Attacking
moves are made with the ﬁre
button pressed and this mode
also gives access to the special
command menu. From these
options your can greet your
friends, check your score or
arm yourself with grenades or
a stun gun. The defensive
moves allow you to duck and
weave in battle or to move
around the corridors.

Mastertronic
i1.99 C-16 + Joystick
HEKTIK IS ONE OF THE OLD-
est types of arcade computer
games. I ﬁrst saw a version of
it on the Apple many years
ago when it was known as
Apple Panic. It must be the
granddaddy of  all platform
games.
The screen is split into ﬁve
levels connected by ladders.
Roaming maliciously f r om
ﬂoor to ﬂoor are monsters out
for y our blood. The only
means of defence is a spade
with which you can dig holes
to trap the monsters, Here the
storyline dips into the realms
of a video nasty as you bash
your unwary quarry about the
ears with the spade until it
falls through t he hole t o
certain death.
As y o u  progress t h e
monsters get nastier and you
have to dig aligned holes in
several levels so that the nasty
creature can fall far enough to
make his trip a  date with
death.
The placement of ladders
is made on a random basis so
no two screens are ever quite
the same. There are 16 levels
to pass through and judging
by my performance I fear that
this may prove t o  b e an
inexhaustable supply for me.
E.D.
long range 'radar' map will
show you any villains lurking
further along the corridor.
At either side of the screen
are two panels which show
the faces of any of the NEXUS
team who are currently on
the animation screen. The
pictures are digitised images
of real people, giving a touch
of plausibility to the game.
On one of the ﬂoors you

Stuart Cooke takes a look at
a package that will make
your rubber stamp obsolete.
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A PROGRAM
appears that makes you wonder how on
earth you managed without it. Printshop
is one such program.
In a nut shell the program will turn
your C64 and your Commodore com-
patible printer into a specialised print
shop dealing in letter heads, cards and
banners. Now you can generate your
own stationary, print your own birthday
cards and generally impress y our
friends.
The program is extremely easy to get
started, you simply load the program
from disk and wait until the menu
appears. The following options are avail-
able:
GREETING CARD
SIGN

The Greeting Card option lets you
chose from either pre-designed cards
such as birthday and Christmas greetings
or you can design your own. If you
choose to design your own you can
choose a graphic from the numerous
available on the disk. These range from a
Christmas tree to a ﬂoppy disk.
As you can see, the range is ext-
remely large. If you do get fed up with
the graphics available on the disk you
can either purchase one of the graphic
supplements that are available which
give you even more graphics to choose
from or you can use the Graphic Desig-
ner option from the main menu to
design your own. A number of graphics
have been included with this article so
you can see what sort o f  detail is
possible.

sides on one piece of paper. Simply fold
it a n d  y o u  hav e a  ready made,
customised card.
The s ign opt ion offers  similar
facilities to the greeting card option but
will allow you to print one large picture.
The size and position of the graphic used
in both this and the card option can also
be changed, this means that the graphic
that you use on the sign could be either
about one inch square or ﬁll the whole
page. Also the smaller the graphic the
more that you can print on the page.
Sign is a great way of producing cheap
posters with a little character.
The letter head option is simply
superb. Basically this option allows you
to produce paper with a customised
header in any of the fonts. The text at the
top of the paper can be centred or
moved to the left and right of the page.
Graphics can also be added and you
have the option of just placing graphics
in the corners, putting a graphic every
other space or having a solid band of
graphics. It is also possible to place text
and graphics at the bottom of each sheet
of paper.
To use the letter head option to its
full potential y o u  would hav e t o
produce numerous sheets on fan-fold
paper and then stick this back into your
printer so that you could use it with your
wordprocessor. Time consuming but
well worth the effort.
The banner option will print large
letters sideways on the paper. This can
be used to print messages in any of the
fonts. Graphics can be added at either
end of the message. This is great for
producing large banners for parties etc.
The screen magic option simply
draws pretty line patterns on the screen,
once a pattern that you like has been
displayed you can store it so that it can
be printed out. I must admit I don't think
that this option is of much use, it simply
isn't as much fun as using the graphics
included or your own.
As prev ious ly  mentioned t h e
 Graphic Editor allows you to design your
own graphics, print them out and store
them on disk for retrieval at a later date.
Great fun if you're any good at art and
would like to send a specialised message
to someone. The graphics editor is easy
to use and all available functions are
clearly displayed at all time.
Print shop is simply an extremely
useful and fun program. Just think, you
may never have to buy another birthday
card. Mind you, one friend did go a little
far when she used Print Shop to send a
wedding invitation to her Goldﬁsh!!

George Duval doodles his
way through some Amiga
software.
HOWEVER IMPRESSIVE THE AMIGA'S
hardware speciﬁcation is, it wouldn't be
anything without the plethora of high
quality programs which have been
written for it, to take advantage of the
technical wizardry.
Almost of all the software I am going
to talk  about was programmed i n
America, but with the Amiga having
been recently launched at the Commo-
dore Show, it seems that many British
software houses ar e dev eloping
programs of a very high standard.
Commodore
When Commodore launched the Amiga
in the US, they had planned to have two
pieces of software available; Graphicraft
and Textcra ft. Craphicraft is an entry
level graphics package, as its name
would suggest, which although not very
special, allowed many people to get the
feel of the machine's capabilities - and
work out what could be done when a
really good package appeared.
Textcraft is  a  very basic word-
processor that, although it  provides
most of the functions of you would
expect (headers, footers, help ﬁles, text
styles etc.) lacks the ﬁnesse to put it up
with the excellent packages available for
the Amiga's closest business rival, the
Macintosh. However, as it is the ﬁrst, it
succeeds in ﬁlling a gap that would
otherwise make the Amiga an unsellable
product.
The ﬁnal product in the Craft range is
Musicraft. Although it is not yet ﬁnished,
I have seen the most up-to-date version
and can tell you that it has a great deal of
potential.
Musicratt has three main options;
the ﬁrst is a straight score which allows
the user to enter or edit a ﬁle, as if it were
in true musical notation (only you don't
need any Tippex!). Option two is to play
using the Amiga's keyboard, which is all
very well, though a little impractical to
say the least! Finally, and in my view
most importantly, is  t he waveform
editor. This allows you to load and edit
waveforms to produce almost any sound
you could want.
Graphically y o u  c an dr aw t h e
waveform you want, or you can choose
from a sine wave, a step up, a step down
or a variety of others. This section also
allows you to edit the envelope and
various ﬁlters (of which there are quite a
few).
If y ou ar e a  budding musician,
Musicraft has a great deal of promise,
and if (as we all hope) Commodore sees
ﬁt t o  release i t  with a  full MID I
sequencer built in, it could easily be of
use to professional musicians.
One product for which everyone has
very high hopes is Commodore's Trans-
former. This is the much-heralded piece
of software that will allow Amiga users to
run existing IBM PC and compatible
software. Although I  have seen this
product, I cannot vouch for its 100%
reliability as no one has any dumb 5.25"
drives to test it out on. However if this
product is ﬁnished and released, you
can be sure it will have a phenomenal
effect o n  t h e  Amiga's  mar k et
penetration!
Electronic Arts
COMM/AUG/P/M3/F1
In America, the ﬁrst company to receive
black-box development machines was
Electronic Arts, and it was therefore not
46
very surprising that EA released the ﬁrst
piece of software which really showed
up the Amiga's capabilities. Deluxe Paint
(or Dpaint as it  is  more commonly
known) is without doubt the most com-
prehensive and impressive piece o f
graphical software ever to appear on a
personal computer! This may sound like
a very over-the-top statement, but it has
to b e  seen t o  be believed. Dpaint
provides many levels of use that vary
from fun for the Amiga user,who aspires
to show what his machine can do, to
incredible pictures from artists who
decide the Amiga is the tool of their
dreams.
Dpaint really does make the most of
the Amiga's limitless capabilities. It can
operate in any of the three graphics
modes, low, medium or high, although

high resolution requires the use of inter-
lacing techniques and is therefore very
demanding on memory.
Starting to use Dpaint is really simple.
Either you can control everything via the
mouse or, for the more experienced
user, you can use the optional keyboard
commands - which certainly speeds up
the process of drawing no end.
Having selected the mode in which
you wish to draw, you are then pre-
sented with a black screen. On the right
you have a permanent control panel,
and the top screen has a variety of pull-
down menus. To start, the best thing is to
load in some of the provided ﬁles, these
vary from a very impressive interpreta-
tion of Botticelli's Venus to a technically
amazing Starﬂight scene.
Once you have got to grips with the
basics of Dpaint, you can start to use
some of the effects that put it so far
ahead of any of its competititors. The
control panel allows you to pick a variety
of drawing shapes and command. You
can draw lines, boxes circles, polygons,
arcs, and ovals tall of which can be ﬁlled
if appropriate). You can also choose to
add text in any of 12 fonts, as well as
being able t o  dr aw using various
symmetrical options.
It must be said however, that these
are only the very basic commands - the
complex ones are awesome. Perhaps the
most famous feature of Dpaint is its
ability to pick up any section of the
screen and use it as a brush. In effect this
means that you could pick up one of
Venus' eyes, enlarge it, spin it round,
and then draw with it! This is very
47
effective if you wish to create multiple
images, each of which takes up only a
small section of the screen.
Another feature of note is the zoom,
which allows you to enlarge any section
of the screen to a greater size, thus
making it much easier to edit or change
detailed sections.
For people who wish t o give an
impression o f  basic animation, t he
comprehensive palette adjustment and
colour cycling abilities will be vital. By
allowing y o u  t o  alter t h e  palette
completely, it is possible to create 32
varying shades of whatever colour you
wish, and by then choosing the range of
the cycle you can produce some very
realistic movement. This is very well
illustrated by  a ﬁle called Waterfall,
which comes on the Dpaint disk.
Quasi thr ee dimensional ﬁlled
drawings can be easily created using the
wide variety of colours, in unison with
the Blend, Smear and Shade commands,
They allow you to use the airbrush tech-
nique to the full, and can lead to some
very impressive results.
Because Dpaint uses the standard IFF
format for graphics ﬁles, any pictures
created on one of the other popular
graphic packages can be loaded into
Dpaint and then edited.
Printers are all catered for through
the Workbench interface, but I must
mention the Okimate 20 printer which.
when used creatively with Dpaint, can
produce some of the most outstanding
colour dumps I have ever seen.
Overall Dpaint is  a  spectacularly
good piece of software. Its only real fault
is that it is sometimes a little slow, mainly
due to the fact it was programmed in C.
Otherwise it must be said that if you own
an Amiga, you must have Dpaint!
The biggest problem with releasing
one piece of software as good as Dpaint
is that everything else must be as good, if
not a little bit better. Electronic Arts'
next release, another in the productivity
series, is Dekixe Print.
Using ﬁles either created on Dpaint,
or built into the art disks of Dprint, this
package is a comprehensive printing
utility that allows the user to create
letters, cards, signs, stickers, invitations,
and a whole variety of other things
amazingly simply.
Not only can you load other IFF ﬁles,
you can overlay text in any of the fonts
provided, and even use the banner
command to enter text strings longer
than 81 characters. To make the most of
Dprint you really need one of the wide
variety of colour printers catered for in
Preferences, the results just don't look
the same in 16 shades of grey!
In theory, Dprint could be used to

produce small booklets or, using some
special functions, colour separations.
Products like Dprint show how close we
are to complete magazine production
on a disk.
If these two programs were not
enough to establish Electronic Arts as
THE software house for the Amiga, the
ﬁnishing touches are being added to a
product which should outshine every-
thing before. Named The Deluxe Video
Construction Set (phew!!), it will do for
animation what Dpaint has done for
static graphics.
Deluxe Video was written t o  let
Amiga Users create animated shows that
could either be for fun or, in a business
environment, practical. Professional
video companies will ﬁnd the scope for
Deluxe Video endless, and in many ways
it should assure the Amiga of a certain
markets.
As w e l l  as  creating animated
drawings. Video allows you the unpre-
cedented feature of being able to add a
complicated soundtrack -  anything
from explosions to Vangelis. Using a
graphics storyboard, and a variety of
timing marks Dv ideo c an c reate
sequences that many competent 68000
programmers would be very jealous of.
I have already seen one very impres-
sive sequence created using Dvideo,
showing t he various stages o f  t he
Shuttle, from a close up at take-off, to a
sequence of it orbiting the world - and it
certainly lived up to my expectations.
Without doubt Electronic Arts is very
conﬁdent of the Amiga's success, and if
EA keeps on producing software of this
quality, it really can't fail!
Aegis
If there is  one company that has
managed t o  r iv al t h e  quality  o f
Electronic Arts  when i t  comes t o
graphics packages. it must be Aegis. Not
only has this company produced an
animation package before EA has
managed to release Deluxe Video, but it
also has an excellent graphics package.
Images is Aegis' attempt at a graphics
package to make the most of the Amiga.
As with Dpaint i t  uses IFF format.
allowing pictures to be imported from
and exported t o  other  packages.
Although Images is  a n outstanding
product, it unfortunately isn't as good as
Dpaint. Deep down, it lacks the facilities
that enable such easy creation o f
complex pictures.
Perhaps the most notable absence,
when compared t o  Dpaint, is  t he
inability to create brushes of anything
but a limited width. Aegis does have one
major thing in its favour - Jim Sachs. He
is the resident artist for Aegis. and is
without doubt the best artist on the
Amiga. His Porsche ﬁles (especially the
new Turbo) are, astonishing.
Aegis' second release for the Amiga
is Animator, a complex and very good
animation package that uses storyboard
techniques i n  a similar way to Dvideo -
to create excellent sequences. Written
by the now defunct Island Graphics
team, i t  allows the user t o  create
anything from basic polygon to polygon
twixing, to much more complex ﬁlled
graphics animations.
Although Animator runs i n  lo w
resolution mode (320 x 200), commands
such as tween, hook, rotate and hue
allow you to mix shapes and colours to
create some very effective 1
graphics, and I'm sure that given enough
time someone cold produce a very good
version of the Channel 4 spinning logo!
Space seems to be the order of the
day as far as animation packages are
concerned as  t h e  o n e  storyboard
provided with Animator consists of an
Apollo lookalike landing on the moon.
Using the background ability, a very
effective three dimensional feel has
been created.
48
My personal favourite product from
Aegis is Draw. Designed primarily as a
serious CAD/architectural program it
allows you a variety of features you
would n o t  normally associate w ith
graphics packages and which, especially
on t he Amiga, c an b e  used very
effectively.
A massive variety of straight lines,
three dimensional boxes and polygons
are all available at the click of a mouse!
Perhaps the most dramatic facility of
Draw is Zoom. This allows you to move
in amazingly close to edit any previously
created pictures. Dr aw is  another
product, like Dpaint, that could quite
easily justify the purchase of an Amiga, if
you had the right application for it.
Overall, Aegis ar e a  very good
software house. Until now a little over-
shadowed b y  EA, b u t  b y  getting
Animator out before Dvideo, and by
releasing the excellent Draw, Aegis has
proved that it's really a force to be
reckoned with.
Various
As well as the big companies who are
producing more than one program for
the Amiga,. t her e a r e  plenty  o f
companies producing o n e  o r  t w o
products. O n e  o f  these companies
produces a product called Gizmoz. As its
name suggests, this is a collection of little
utilities that add up to a very impressive
package indeed. As well as the now
obligatory calculator, ther e is  a n
excellent communications package, and
plenty of other bits and bobs.
Whilst on the subject of comms. I
though I ' d  mention a n  excellent
terminal program I  received called
Online!. Not only does it allow the
Amiga t o  emulate various ot her
computers, but it allows split screens,
stored ﬁles, auto dialling, preset calling
(which means you can set it to call up a
certain system at a certain time and grab
any messages before logging off!), and
all for $70 in the US.
Not to be left out, England has at least
one product to be proud of. Although
not ﬁnished yet, Y2's Prestel software is
particularly impressive -  especially
when you consider that the Amiga has
been on sale in America for more than
six months!
Conclusion
It is a great relief to me to see the quality
and quantity of software that is coming
through, both from America and more
recently t he UK. Products such as
Deluxe Paint are of such a high quality
that they almost assure the Amiga's
success, whatever its critics have said.

o o v  s me bandy]
tips for Pius/4
Cassette users.
IT HAS ALWAYS STRUCK ME
as being extremely silly that
Commodore packaged the
Plus/4 c omputer  w i t h  a
cassette recorder. The reason
that it seems odd is because
in-built software has no way
of SAVEing t o  this device.
Don't despair, I have found a
way in which you can use the
in-built wordprocessor with
the cassette recorder. Now
you don't have to go to the
expense o f  buying a  disk
drive.
As w e l l  a s  g i v i n g
information about how to use
the Plus/4 with cassette, I
have also modiﬁed the Full
Speed A h e a d  fas t t a p e
routine so that it  sits in a
better place in the Plus/4's
memory so that you can write
longer programs as well as use
it with the wordprocessor.
Now you can SAVE and LOAD
documents just as fast as your
friends with disk drives.
Saving Documents
on Tape
Type the document as usual,
you can print it either before
or after saving on tape. How-
ever, you will need to make a
PR
note of the last line of your
document in the word pro-
cessor. Read c i n  t h e
display on the bottom of the
screen.
When the document is
c ompleted e n t e r  t h e
Machine Code Monitor by
following t h e  proc edure
below VERY CAREFULLY.
1. Press the RESET button
(small button next t o  the
on/off switch) and hold it de-
pressed.
2. Press and HOLD down the
RUN/STOP k ey  ( nex t t o
SHIFT LOCK).
3. Now release ﬁrst the RESET
button, and after the screen
has changed, the RUN/STOP
key. ( If the RUN/STOP is
pressed ﬁrst it prints the letter
'c' in the document).
The document is stored in
RAM memory starting from
location Hex $C000 ﬁnishing
according to its length. It is
possible t o  view it  in  the
Monitor's ASCII dump dis-
play, (type 'MC000' [U N ] )
but only upper case letters
and numerals will be shown.
For the Monitor t o  access
RAM above $8000, you have
to change the value in Loca-
tion S07F8 to $80. See the
Plus/4 manual page 183 for a
full explanation.
Now type the following to
save the data:
S"FILENAME",1,C000,XXXX
[RI N]
XXXX being the end address
49
CESS
found i n  the table below
according to the last line of
text in the document.
The cassette recorder
prompts will show as normal.
To load a previously saved
document enter the word
processor ﬁrst and go to the
Machine Code Monitor as
described above, but clear
any document from memory
ﬁrst, by keying CBM 'c', then
'cm' [RTN].
If y ou don't clear, the
documents w i l l  mer ge -
which could prove a useful
facility, load a short docu-
ment into the top of the pro-
cessor t o  merge with one
already in the lower part.
The load command is 'I'
[RTN]. Y o u  c a n  s pec ify
"FILENAME" after the 'L', as
on tape it will otherwise load
the ﬁrst program that it comes
to. I hope, however, that you
will keep a clear record of the
cassette recorder revolutions
for each document as, unlike
the disk drive, it cannot go
straight to a ﬁle. If you do not
know where it is, you may
have a long wait before the
letter which you want to load
is found.
When t h e  t a p e  h a s
stopped key, 'X' [RINI] [RTN]:
The Plus/4 has taken us to the
spreadsheet. Key CBM 'c' and
then 'tw' [RTN]. You will now
be in the wordprocessor with
your document displayed.
Use the same procedure to
return to the wordprocessor
after saving on tape.
NE
Another merge possibility
is to save the document not
from the beginning, but from
a later line number. In this
case substitute 'C000' with the
corresponding Hex number
for that line in  the table.
Doing it this way, we lose the
Set Pointers for that section,
as these are stored in the ﬁrst
part o f  the RAM at $C000
before the actual text. It is
best to set these again at the
end of each paragraph after
merging, in order to be able
to use the edit facility.
have encountered a
strange phenomenon when
printing a  document after
loading i t  fr om tape. The
same may also happen when
loading from disk.
If you print straight after
loading, it will only print up to
the line actually displayed on
the screen, and will only print
the whole document it you
have run the cursor down the
document to the bottom line
at some stage. You may also
ﬁnd peculiar things occurring
if you try to edit, insert, or
delete lines without going
down to the last line ﬁrst. And
the shifted ClearHome will
not take you right down until
you have viewed the end of
the document.
Using Fast Tape Save
Published i n  t he February
1986 edition of Your Com-
modore magazine was an

WORDPR
article and program by Nick
Hampshire called Break the

used f o r  all my  programs

$3D00. top of RAM for the
C16. In order to store it at
$7000 or any other location,
some of the lines have to be
amended as shown in  the
listing.
Using the Fastsave with
the wordprocessor you have
to s top t h e  Plus/4 f r om
jumping in t o  Basic after
loading o r  saving, as y ou
cannot get back to the word-
processor b y  the 'SYS1525'
command on key 11' without
clearing the document from
memory, This is prevented in
line 1165, forcing a BREAK to
the Monitor, To activate the
Fast Sav e w h e n  i n  t h e

minutes t o  load o r  save,
whereas Fastsave will do it in
about only 45 seconds. Inci-
dentally, roughly 25 seconds
of this time is taken up by
leader, header and gap, and
eight kilobytes o f  data is
actually written and read in
only 20 seconds_ I urge you to
use the Fastsave routine y ou
will deﬁnitely not need a disk
drive then.
You can load the pre-
viously saved Fastsave routine
from t h e  Monitor  either
before entering the word-
processor o r  after, by  the
command 'L' PUN]. If you do
the former, you can also load
it from Basic with 'LOAD
;IX. When ready to Fastsave
you must have commanded
•G7000' and then use device
code '7' before the addresses.
If you want to use the fast
tape routine with other pro-
grams.. I ﬁnd it best to store it
at $7D00, which is the highest
RAM that Machine Code can
easily access. To protect this
from being overwritten it is
necessary to lower the top of
memory b y  ' PO KE 5 6 ,
DEC("71D”):CLR'. This leaves
27900 bytes for your Basic
program and variables.
If this is too little, I suggest
you store the routine at $1000,
which is  the beginning o f
RAM for Basic, so the vectors
for start of Basic will have to
be raised before you load and
run the Fast Tape Loader, and
any programs that have been
fast saved previously. Do this
by 'X=DEC("13"): P0KE44,X:
POKE*256,0:NEW'.
This will not work if you
are going to use the hi-res
modes.
Then store the routine at
S4000, and raise the start of
Basic to 'X=DEC("43")'. But
you h a v e  t o  c ommand
'GRAPHIC 2,1' IRTNI at least
once bef or e loading o r
moving the start of Basic. If
you use hi-res modes with the
Fastsave routine at $7D00, the
Start of Basic will not have to
be moved, but you should
also us e t h e  GRAPHIC2,1
command ﬁr s t  b e f o r e
loading_ Don't use GRAPHIC
CLR at all. Whenever I have
NE
tried to, it just seems to move
Basic higher up rather than
lower. Although GRAPHIC 0
on its own is alright.
I ﬁnd that its best to load
the Fastsave routine before
any Basic programs, and then
type 'NEW' IRTNI. But you do
not need the routine to load a
Fastsaved program, this  is
only necessary if you intend
to do more saving.
Wordprocessing Tips
If you want to writequotation
marks " ,  you will ﬁnd that
pressing shifted '2' will give an
apostrophe. To get a proper
quote y ou have to use its
ASCII value 34 in  reverse
video (Control key/RVs On),
the manual calls it ''Embed-
ding ASCII Characters". You
then ty pe 'asc34;'. I  have
found s ome problems i n
using this, in that sometimes
the character appears in the
wrong position, perhaps in
the middle o f  an adjacent
word.
I think this has something
to do with the justiﬁcation of
the document, as it doesn't
seem to happen when not
justiﬁed, so it may be easier to
give the command no justify
preceding the paragraph with
the quotes.
Another method whic h
allows you to keep the just-
iﬁcation i s  t o  ignore t h e
incorrect position o f  t h e
printed ASCII character, until
you have ﬁnally edited and
corrected the printed docu-
ment.
You now have to force the
line in which the ASCII char-
acter appears to become the
end of a paragraph. Place the
cursor on the word that, on
the paper, starts the next line
after t he ASCII character,
Now insert spaces (shifted
Insti-Del key) so that this part
of the text moves until it is at
the beginning of the next line
on the screen. Then move the
cursor back to where it was
when you started inserting
and press return. Although a
new paragraph has  been
created, it will still be printed
as continuous text. Occasion-
•

P l u s / e t
o n
th
e
ally, you have to do the same
with the beginning of the line
with the ASCII character to
get it laid out correctly.
It can be a bit tedious, but
worth it if you want to have a
good lo o k in g  d o cu me n t .
Don't f o rg e t  t o  s e t  t h e
pointers at the end of each
paragraph as, if you try to edit
without, yo u  will tear your
hair out with frustration.
As we ll as the 'enhance
on/off' (double width letters)
'asc14/15;', as mentioned in
the manua, other ASCII codes
that can he embedded are:
reverse on = a s c 1 8 ;
linefeed = a
s c 1
0
;
graphic mode = a s c 1 4 5 ;
reverse off- - a s c 1 4 6 ;
carriage return = a s c 1 3 ;
nongraphic mode = a s c 1 7 ;
The g r a p h i c  m o d e
'asc145;' w i l l  e n a b le  t h e
graphic characters that can be
generated by shifted alphabet
keys (not with CBM key) to be
printed, but you will not see
them displayed on the screen
as such. You have to  check
the symbols on the keyboard
carefully and type mo re  o r
less blind.
It appears you ma y also
have to  repeat the 'asc14.5;'
command for each new line
on t h e  paper just another
Plus/4 p e c u l i a r i t y .  T h e
'asc17;' w i l l  re tu rn  t o  t h e
normal non-graphic mode.
It is also possible to print
the other graphic characters
by stringing their ASCII codes
together, f ro m page 194 to
196 in  th e  User Manual. I t
appears that th e  ma ximu m
possible number is ﬁve, and
the 'graphic mode' will have
had to be set ﬁrst. When using
two o r  mo re  ASCII codes
together i n  reverse video,
separate each number fro m
the previous one by a semi-
colon. You d o  not need to
repeat the 'asc' command.
Underlining can be made
by the '-' (broken) or shifted
(continuous), b u t  o n ly
when the underlining itself
occupies its own line on the
paper. A n d  again yo u  ma y
have found out by trial and
error.
I h a ve  n o tice d  t h a t  a
created b lo ck w i l l  stay i n
memory even after you have
cleared memory (cleared the
screen), and can be inserted
on the blank screen, which is
useful if  you want to  retain
only o n e  paragraph o f  a
document.
You can use the line feed
to keep records o f  mailing
lists of names and addresses
more easily as a wordproces-
sor d o cu me n t  (sa ve d  o n
tape!). After each segment of
the address type 'asc10;' in
reverse video, and continue
typing the remainder of the
P1115/
address o n  t h e  same lin e
without pressing Return until
the end of each address. Each
section of the address will be
printed on paper on a new
line, although on the screen it
appears as a continuous line.
Up t o  99 addresses can b e
stored o n  o n e  document.
Before pressing Return you
car) add 'asc10;10;' fo r two
extra blank lines before the
next address.
Please re me mb e r t h a t
every time 'asc', followed by a
number has been mentioned,
it must b e  typed in  reverse
video on the screen (Control'

graphics designer
[that  you ever likely  1
need.
THE VAST MAJORITY O F
computer pr ogr ammer s
probably a diverse range of
graphics aids. These may
include screen editors, char-
acter editors or sprite editors.
The only problem is that none
of them can carry out all the
functions that the program-
mer requires. Obviously, the
only way around this is to use
a number o f  programs t o
produc e o n e  ﬁn is h e d
product.
For example, i f  I  was
writing a game I would use a
character editor to produce
user deﬁned characters. I
would then use these to pro-
duce the actual background
for the game. Then I would
load in a sprite editor and
pr oduc e t h e  s p r it e s .
Wouldn't it  b e easier if  it
could all be done with one
program which encompassed
all the functions I could ever
need? Hence the birth of the
3 IN I EDITOR,
3 IN / consists of a sprite
editor that has provision for
multic olour  a n d  h i- r e s
sprites. Spr ites  c a n  b e
animated. copied, positioned
on top of  each other etc.
Wtihin the program there is
also a  combined character
and background editor, What
makes t h is  p a r t  o f  t h e
program so special is that you
are not limited to designing
just single screens but it is
possible t o  deﬁne screens
that take up to 32K of the
computers memory.
The editing screen acts as a
small window that can b e
moved over a much larger
area. Screens such as the ones
I created in games like Monty
on t h e  Run and Son o f
Blagger are extremely easy to
produce. U ntil n o w  most
scrolling s c r eens  w e r e
designed a s  in d iv id u a l
pictures and 'stuck' one next
to the other at a later date.
The 3  I N  1  Editor has
already aroused much inte-
rest in programming circles
and many programmers will
be using it  t o  help them
design games that will b e

months. The complete editor
program is published here so
that it is available to anyone
who is interested in graphics.
This month I will detail the
commands available within
the editor so that you will be
able to use it. In next month's
issue of the magazine twill be
presenting a  few example
backgrounds so that you can
see exactly what is possible
with the editor.
Getting it All In
3 IN 1 Editor is presented in
the form of a series of Basic
loaders. This makes it  ex-
tremely easy t o  enter and
check f o r  ty ping errors.
Simply type in all of the loader
programs and save them on to
disk or tape. If you are using
tape then do make sure that
you change the ',8' to ',1' in
the LOAD instructions where
indicated.
Once you have entered all
of the programs and saved
them individually then you
can create the actual machine
code ﬁle that you will use. To
do this LOAD the program
'31N1 LOADERI and ty pe
RUN. This w ill POKE the
machine code into the neces-
t
t
S;iry areas of memory. Once
the program has ﬁnished run-
ning it will automatically load
the next part of the program
from TAPE or DISK. You did
change the numbers if using
tape didn't you? Once the last
part of the program has been
RUN press the space bar to
enter t h e  program. .31N1
EDITOR is now ready for use.
Use option 8 to SAVE 3/N1
EDITOR.
To use the editor in future
you type;
54
LOAD "31N1 EDITOR',81 for
disk
or
LOAD '31N1 EDITOR',1,1 for
tape.
In or der  t o  start t h e
program you then type:
SYS 50300
If, w h ile entering t h e
program, y ou made any
typing errors these will be
found b y  t h e  indiv idual
LOADER programs when
they are RUN. If you do ﬁnd
any errors then you will either
be presented with the line
number where the error is
located or an 'illegal quantity
error. The way to deal with
each of these errors is de-
tailed below.
Error in Line Number
If you get this error message
then simply list the program
so that you can ﬁnd out in
which LOADER program the
error occurred, Then correct
the line by comparing yours
with t h e  lis ting f o r  that
LOADER and then re-save the
program. Do make sure that if
using tape you don't resave
the program over another
part and that you save it in the
correct position so that it can
be loaded in order.
Illegal Quantity Error
If you get this error then you
have either typed in a number
greater than 255 or  simply
missed a number out. If you
do get an error then type this
line and press RETURN:
PRINT 2040-1-(10*L)
The number that is printed
denotes the line where the
error is Correct the line as for
the above error and try again.

you are unsure of what the

the main ones in Figure 1.
The DIR function will dis-
play a directory listing from

However, because '3IN1' only
uses program ﬁles (i.e.PRG)
then only this type of ﬁle is
listed to the screen. Also the
size of the ﬁle is not given as it
is not really that important.
Just in case you ever have
any disk errors, I have inc-
luded Option 7  which will
read the error channel of the
disk drive and report any
errors.
Option 8  is  extremely
important. T his  func tion

output as both this option and
Option 9 will have either a 1'
or an '8' after them. A  1 '
speciﬁes an output device of 1
i.e. cassette while an '8' means
device 8 which is disk.
The ﬁnal command avail-
able from the main menu is
LOAD, This will LOAD the
speciﬁed ﬁle into the same
area of memory that it was
saved from. This means that
you can load any of the ﬁles
created w i t h  t h e  edit or
programs f r om t h e  main
menu.
Using the Editors
Before I take a close look at
the i n d i v i d u a l  e d i t o r
programs it is worth pointing
out a few conventionc
Firstly all numerical inputs
and outputs are in HEX. This is
because most programmers
work in hexadecimal since it
is a lot easier when writing
machine c ode than using
decimal. Since this program
was designed as a program-
mers tool it is obvious that it
should use HEX. All inputs
must be made up of two digits
e.g. '00' or '03'.
A lot of the functions can
be controlled by either the
cursor keys or a joystick in
port two. Since the joystick
only has one ﬁre button and it
may need to either erase or
set points, the 'F1' key is used
to select its operation. O n
both editors a ﬂag of either
one o r  zero is used. O ne
indicates that the joystick will
set a point while a zero means
that it will delete a point. Take
a look at the labelled pictures
of both editors to see where
the ﬂags are,
Alongside the joystick ﬂag
in both editors is the device
ﬂag. As with the main menu
this can be either an 8 or 1.
Again look at the pictures in
order to see where the ﬂag
can be found.
The Sprite Editor
The sprite editor allows you to
edit sprites in either multi-
colour or hi-res mode. Sprites
SAO to $FF can be edited with
the editor. If you are unsure
about sprite numbers then I
suggest that you have read
the section on sprites in the
C64 manual. If you take a look
at the picture you will seethat
there i s  q u it e  a  l o t  o f
information on the screen.
Firstly we have the actual
sprite editing screen. This
displays a blown up version of
the sprite being edited. If you
choose multicolour then the
horizontal resolution w ill
halve, exactly the same as
with multic olour  sprites.
Unlike most sprite editors you
actually design t h e  sprite
using the colour for each dot.
This means that you don't
have to think which combina-
tion of dots produces which
colour. Simply press one to
three t o select the editing
colour and hey prestol draw
dots with it.

extremely easy simply press
'M
mode or 'H• for hi-res mode.
If you want t o  reverse the
sprite simply press CONTROL
and R. Easy isn't it
It's n o t  r eally  w o r t h
mentioning all of the avail-
able commands since they are
all listed in Figure 2. However,
a f e w  functions d o  need
further explanation.
At the bottom right hand
corner of the screen there are
four sprites referred t o  as
sprites zero to three. Note
these are NOT the same as
sprite numbers but are just
used as reference numbers
for the four at the bottom of
the screen. Usually these four
positions h o ld  t h e  s ame
sprites as that which is being
edited. I t  i s  possible t o
expand these sprites using the
left arrow )  and up arrow
( )  keys so that you can 5ee
the different combinations of
sprite available. To alter the
way that t he sprite looks
simply press one of the above
keys followed by the corres-
ponding s pr ite pos ition
number (0-3).
Pressing CONTROL AND

bottom o f  the screen. This
means that you can position
the four sprites next to each
other or even overlap them.
This may not seem all that
useful at ﬁrst but it is possible
to make each of these four
sprites different. This means
that you could deﬁne a large
character of up to four sprites
joining the sprites together at
the bottom of the screen so
that you can see what they
look like. It is even possible to
animate this section of the
screen with the CONTROL N
command and the Q and W
keys. Pressing CONTROL and
N followed by 00 will cause
each of the four sprites at the
bottom o f  t h e  screen t o
become the same as the one
being edited. If on the other
hand after typing CONTROL
and N you enter a number
greater than 00 you can set up
animations.
Animation i s  q u i t e
difﬁcult to explain and is best
ﬁgured o u t  w it h practice.
However I will do my best to
explain how to set up and use
this s p e c ia l a n im a t io n
function.
When you enter a number
greater t han 0 0  f o r  t h e
number of animations after a
CONTROL N instruction the
sprites at the bottom of the
screen will change. If, for
example, we had pressed 01
after CONTROL N, sprite 0
would b e  the same as the
actual sprite $AO. Sprite 01 will
be the same as $A1. Sprite 02
will be the same as $A2 etc. If
we now press the keys W and
Q w e  can increment and
dec r ement t h e  s p r i t e
numbers at the bottom of the
screen giving the appearance
of animation. If we press •W,
Sprite 00 will become actual
sprite SA1, Sprite 01 w ill
become actual sprite $A2 etc.
If we had entered 04 after a
CONTROL N instruction then
the sprites would be incre-
mented by four every time
you pressed the 'W' KEY, i.e.
sprite 00 would become 5A4,
Sprite 01 would become SAS
etc.
I did say that this form of
animation was complicated
but if you try it then I'm sure
that it will all fall into place.
Just i n  case y ou have
problems with this type of
animation there is a simpler
form. T h i s  i s  t h e  ' A '
instruction. This instruction
will change all the sprites on
the screen, including t h e
56
large editing screen, in incre-
ments of one for a preset
length. When you press 'A'
you will be prompted at the
top of the screen for the ﬁrst
sprite in the sequence and the
last, then the sprites will be
displayed in order. Pressing
and 'S' will speed up and
slow down the speed of this
animation.
That just about sums it up
for the sprite editor. I'm sure
that you will ﬁnd it very easy
to use with a little practice
and that you will ﬁnd most of
the instructions that you are
ever likely to need.
Character Screen
Editor
Both o f  these editors are
present on the same screen.
The top half is the character
editor while the bottom is
used as a small window over a
larger screen.
Quite a lot of information
is present on this screen and it
is w o r t h  s t u d y in g  t h e
commented picture in order
to ﬁnd where everything is.
For mo r e  experienced
programmers I have included
the provision of  using two
different character sets. I n
order to use the second set
you must set up an interrupt
raster on the graphics editing
screen with the 'P' command
while inside the background
editor. Abov e t h e  raster,
character set one w ill b e
displayed, while below the
raster y ou w ill b e  i n  the
second character set. Char-
acter set one sits at $0800 and
set two is at $2000.
Again it is worth looking at
some o f  t h e  av ailable
commands in more detail, a
summary of them all can be
found in Figure 3.
As with the sprite editor,
characters can be edited in
either multi-colour or hi-res
mode, colours being chosen
and changed as in the sprite
editor.
Once you have entered a
character you can place it
anywhere within a deﬁned
background i n  t h e  back-
ground editor. The l• key is
used t o  m o v e  c o n t r o l
between either the character
editor o r  t he background
editor. You can see which
mode you are in by seeing
which cursor is ﬂashing.

can be anything from two by

maximum in either direction
being 255 characters or SFF.
Obviously your screen size is
limited by  the amount o f
memory available_ If there is
not enough room for your
window then you will have to
enter new values. I have made
up t o  3 2 K o f  me mo r y
av able f o r  t h e  window
though I'm sure that you will
ﬁnd that you very rarely use
this much. The two numbers
in the middle of the screen
show y o u  w h e r e  y o u r
window starts and ﬁnishes in
memory.
One very important con-
s ider ation f o r  g a m e s
programmers is where they
are actually going to put their
screen. T he CONTROL B
command will prompt you for
the high byte and low byte for
your screen position so that
you can move it where you
want. Do make sure that you
don't overwrite any  other
programs in memory, such as
the editor.
You may think that it is a
little limiting to just see a
small section of  your total
graphics screen at one time, I
have therefore included the
•W' command whic h w ill
switch to a full screen display
in whic h y ou c an mov e
around t h e  background,
movement being controlled
by the cursor keys only.
It is possible to set up a
border character which is dis-
played around the smaller
editing window. I  usually
leave this blank though you
may try different effects by
putting fancy borders around
the screen. This does not
apply to full screen mode.
Saving and Loading
As I said earlier, it is possible
to load any type of ﬁle into
memory f r o m  t h e  m a in
menu. It is also possible to
load any type of ﬁle from
within any  o f  t h e  other
editors as well. However the
I/O device is separate in each
editor so you must change it
in eac h s ec tion o f  t h e
program.
Even though y o u  c an
LOAD in any type of data
from within any section of the
program, you can only save
each type of data from the
correct editor. You mus t
therefore be in the character
editor in order to SAVE your
user deﬁned graphics. You
must be in the sprite editor to
save sprites and you must be
in the background editor in
order to save backgrounds.
Note
When y ou design a  back-
ground, make sure tht you
keep a note of the screen size
that is deﬁned, since a screen
that is supposed to be 20 char-
acters wide will look rather
silly if the screen is set to 21
characters.
Examples
Since there is probably quite
a lot of information to grasp
about the editor in this issue
of the magazine I will leave it
there. Next month I will be
giving y o u  s ome sample
screens, which you can see in
the photographs accompany-
ing this article, together with
some more hints and tips
about h o w  t o  u s e  t h e
program.
3 IN 1 Editor will no doubt
be updated continually. I will
try to put updates in Your
Commodore when they are
available. In the meantime if
you hav e a n y  ideas  o r
c omments  a b o u t  t h i s
program then please write to
me c i o  Your Commodore
and it will be forwarded to
me.
I hope that you ﬁnd the
program as useful as many
programmers have already
done.
Stop Press
Since the text for this article
was originally set, the 3 IN 1
EDITOR has been improved.
The main improvement is
the addition of a pull down
menu facility for  accessing
the commands. If you press
the F7 key,whilst in any of the
editors, a list of the available
functions will be displayed.
Move the selector up and
down t h e  lis t a n d  press
RETURN to select the option
that you require.
A GRAB option has also
been added. [his will allow
you to copy large areas of the
background screen with ease
as well as copy sprites into
characters and vice versa.
These functions are described
in the HELP sections of the
program and I  will explain
them i n  more detail next
month.

[An impish 128 utility]
by M E Catley.
DIMON 128 I S  A  DISK
utility program for the C128
Computer for use with a CBM
1541 or CBM 1571 disk drive.
Carefully t y p e  i n  t h e
program, whic h MUST b e
saved before running as it will
over-write itself, I t  is  fully
error trapped, and on comp-
letion will ask for a ﬁlename.
This is the name under which
the machine code will b e
saved a n d  subsequently
loaded as a Basic program.
When run, you will see a
menu/help page giving all
the commands and their
syntax. This page can be re-
called at any time by pressing
"M". All commands need to
be followed by pressing the
return key.
A word of warning. Some
of the commands incorpora-
ted into the disk monitor
write directly on to disk track/
sectors. I t  is  always worth
making a back-up copy of the
disk before starting, as any
error c ould pr ov e catas-
trophic.

- Re-display the main menu/help page.
R XX XX -  READ a track/sector directly off the disk
into a buffer in the computer. This
command will enable any track/sector of
the disk to be read into the buffer where it
can be viewed, altered or prepared for
storing back on the disk.
W XX XX -  WRITE a track/sector from the computer
buffer directly on to the disk. This
command enables data in the buffer, be it
typed in from the keyboard or read off
the disk and modiﬁed, to be recorded on to
the speciﬁed track/sector of the disk.
M XX XX -  Display memory from the buffer. One
sector of data consists of 256 bytes. This
command will enable all or any of these
bytes to be displayed on the screen. The
ﬁrst hex number is the ﬁrst byte to be
displayed, whilst the second i5 the ﬁnal
byte. Due to the size of the screen in 40
column mode, not all 255 bytes can be
simultaneously displayed. The display will
show the hex contents of the buffer and
the ASCII contents providing these are
printable, i.e. ASCII codes between 32 and
127 are printed, others being replaced
with a period.
MT 
-
 This is a variant of the memory command
and is a short hand method of displaying a
screenful of memory starting at the
top of memory ($OO) down to (SM.
MB 
-
 This is similar to the MT command, but
displays the bottom of the buffer from
t$50i to (SM.
- The semi-colon command enables on-
screen editing of the buffer. When the
memory display commands are used, the
buffer contents are displayed on the screen
preceded by a semi-colon. This enables on-
screen editing to take place, so that when
the cursor is placed over a byte and the
byte is modiﬁed, the buffer contents are
also modiﬁed ready for saving back to disk.
- This is the command that reads the disk
error channel and displays it on the screen.
Any time the error light ﬂashes on the disk
drive, pressing 'AO" will clear the error
indication and display the error number,
error type, error track and error sector.
- When a track/sector has been read into
the computer buffer, the ﬁrst two bytes
contain the track and sector respectively of
the next block of the ﬁle. If this is the last
block in the ﬁle, the track value is zero, This
command will read the track and sector
values of the next block and load that
block into the buffer, displaying which
track and sector is involved. A track value
of zero indicates the last block of the ﬁle
has been loaded.
- This command will read the disk directory,
displaying the track and sector of the ﬁrst
block of the ﬁle, the length of the ﬁle, the
ﬁlename, and the ﬁle type. It will display
II

all ﬁle types, including deleted ﬁles which
facilitates the recovery of ﬁles that have
been inadvertantly scratched, providing
that no writing has been done to the disk
since the erasure. The directory is displayed
in blocks of up to 16 ﬁles, and ﬁnishes with
the number of blocks free, as always in hex.
- TRACE will, as its name suggests, trace a
ﬁle on a disk and display the sequence of
track/sectors in the order in which it was
saved. The requested ﬁlename must be
correct, and no wildcards are allowed.
X 
-
 EXIT to Basic.
LOCK or write protect the disk. This
command will render the disk write
protected without the use of a write protect
tab (which always falls off). Any attempt to
save a ﬁle on a disk so protected, results in
error 73, DOS TYPE error message.
- UNLOCK or write enable the disk. This
command is the opposite of the LOCK
command and renders the disk write
enabled, overcoming the software
protection afforded by LOCK.
1
- On the CBM 1571 and CBM 1541 disk
drives, when the ﬁle type byte in the disk
directory has bit six set, the ﬁle cannot be
scratched by the BASIC 7 command
SCRATCH or by BASIC 2's OPEN15,8,15,
"SO:1ilename":close15. This condition is
indicated in a directory listing by a " < "
character next to the ﬁlename. The
command sets bit six of all the ﬁles in the
directory and so renders them individually
protected against erasure.
- The K command is the opposite of the J
command, and resets bit six of all the ﬁles
in the disk directory enabling erasure from
the directory by conventional means.
A 
-
 The A command is similar to the .1
command, but only operates on one
named ﬁle in the directory. Again, the
ﬁlename must be correct and no wildcards
are allowed.
- The8command is once more the
opposite of theA command and will enable
one named ﬁle to be un-protected in the
directory.
Used with care, the disk
monitor can be of consider-
able assistance i n  t h e
management of a disk library.
However, careless use can
have disastrous results, s o
always ensure you have a
back-up of your disk.
Happy disk monitoring]

Eric Doyle presents a
k
While delving through m y  box  o f
routines I came across this one from one
of our many Australian readers. This
particular Wizard o f  Oz is Anthony
Garrett of Capel, Western Australia, and
he has conjured up a routine which will
make a NEWed program reappear as if
by magic. Obviously, its all entered in
direct mode on any C64:
POKE 2050,8
SYS 42291
POKE 45, PEEK(174)
POKE 46, PEEK(175)
POKE 47, PEEK(174)
POKE 48, PEEK(175)
POKE 49, PEEK(174)
POKE 50, PEEK(175)
CLR
When NEW is entered two zero bytes are
placed in the ﬁrst two program memory
locations. These normally tell the com-
puter where to ﬁnd the next line but two
zero bytes say 'that's your lot, pal'. All
programs end with two zeros arid the
LIST and RUN commands react by leap-
ing back to the familiar READY message
above a  ﬂashing cursor. Naturally
enough, if zeros are the ﬁrst bytes these
routines receive then they  assume
there's nothing wor th reading and
switch off straight away.
The ﬁrst line gives a value to one of
these bytes. It's not the correct value so
the second line jumps to the ROM
routine which rechains the lines. This is
one of the clever little routines which
the Operating System uses when you
add a line in the middle of an existing
program. The effect is that the ﬁrst two
bytes are changed to their correct values
so the program is all there now.
Unfortunately, no-one's told the rest
of the computer, so it still won't run yet.

Even now  they're still not quite
correct but a simple CLR command sorts
them out poperly. Et voila, back comes
the old program.
Staying the Basic for a while, K B
Blight of Milton Keynes, has two string
handling routines t o  give your title
pages a bit of pzazz.
In both routines LE is the length of
the string and L calculates a TAB value to
whack it in at the centre of the screen.
Beyond that, my lips are sealed. If you
want to know what happens you'll have
to try them for yourself.
Staffordshire is famous for pottery
and Steve Kimberley. who is well known
as someone who likes pottering about
with C-16s to produce programs such as
Cyborg. He writes, to give everyone the
beneﬁt of his experience:
'A listing is useful for  debugging or
producing a hard copy of some code.
This program will allow the user to send
monitor-style or disassembled code to a
printer. Save the program and then run
it. Specify M or D with the start and ﬁnish
of your code and it will print the desired
section."

"The program will autorun after the ﬁrst
time to allow the printing of more than
one block of code."
Steve also reminds us not to use the
Basic program storage area at $1000 for
the code because the program over-
writes it. We wouldn't be that stupid
would we? Well, would we?
Malcolm Serbert of Harrogate has
something simple, short and effective
which he'd like to share with the world.
It's a loader routine for safeguarding
your C64 programs.
The program works by asking the
user's name and then storing a message
high in memory. It then points the LIST
jump vector to a routine which will print
the message on the screen. The net
effect is that any user naughty enough to
try listing the program is greeted by a
personalised refusal.
The machine code breaks down into
three simple routines:

completes his
arcade series.
THIS MONTHS ARTICLE IS
the ﬁnal one in the series (all
together — Aahl) so I shall
ﬁnish off by adding a title
screen_ The data should be
typed i n  using t h e  entry
routine provided in the ﬁrst
article (Your Commodore,
January '86). The start address
is 24576 and the number of
bytes is 1024. Save it under the
name of "FROGSCRN".
The short piece of code
simply sets the background
colour t o  black, sets a ll
character squares t o  blue
foreground and transfers the
data from $6000 to $0400 (the
v ideo m a t r ix ) .  F i n a l l y
JOYREAD is called to test for a
depression of the ﬁrebutton.
That's it!
Enjoy yourself, and watch
out for menacing Frenchmen!

EXHIBIT tONum
IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT THE COMPUTER
Press gets excited, but the ofﬁcial launch
of the Amiga was an event not to be
missed. F o r  onc e t h e  lu r e  o f  a
Champagne Breakfast wasn't the main
attraction and the buzz which was going
around wasn't the sound of all-night
copywriters catching up on their sleep.
We w e r e  s h e p h e r d e d  p a s t
Llamasoft's stand into the Commodore
Theatre and the tension mounted. At
last the gods would descend and reveal
to us mere mortals the price of their
great miracle. Never since Moses was
given the Tablets of Stone had words
been awaited with such great expecta-
tion.
Enter the Amiga
The reality was about as exciting as
Moses disclosing a note to his milkman.
With such a  revolutionary piece of
hardware one would have anticipated
demos galore, ﬂashing lights and in-
spirational music. All we got was Chris
Kaday, a slide show and the intrusive
strains of music for Psychedelia from the
Llamasoft stand.
Admittedly, the slide show was pro-
duced by  projected images from an
Amiga whic h were, i n  their  way,
impressive but they merely gave a hint at
the capabilities o f  the machine. N o
Amiga ball this time just images to help
the pep talk along. O h yes, and the
price. Any dreams of a sub MOO price
tag were soon shattered (if any such
romantic dreams were still with us). The
stark reality is 0475 + VAT with a single
disk drive, which means £3.75 change
from E1700 f o r  t h e  mor e modest
machine and 0675 + VAT for the twin
drive version.
Music Sales' demonstration of the
new Music Expansion System under the
magic touch of megastar Rick Wakeman
was far more impressive, but more of
this later_
Outside the theatre the Show was
coming to life like some great monster
stirring itself after a year of hibernation.
Another shock-horror story was waiting
to unfold. Where were the big boys. US
Gold and Ariolasoft? I mean no dis-
service t o  Bubble Bus, Llamasoft,
Mirrorsoft, Martech, Anco, Tynesoft
and Level 9 who all made the effort to
meet the people they serve so well, but
the many  games publishers wer e
noticeable by  their absence. Where
were they all?
At least there was plenty for the
punter in  the bargain basement. At
times it seemed more like a Middle
Eastern bazaar than an exhibition, with
milling crowds and cut-price offers. Not

that we saw much of a throng on Satur-
day with the FA Cup's inevitable attrac-
tions keeping the attendance down_ In
contrast, Sunday was like the good old
days of computer mania, sweaty and
swarming.
Upstairs the scene was beginning to
look like the Commodore Pet Shows of
yore with t he principal commodity
being business software for the 64, 128
and Amiga.

Reactions
The optimistically named Amiga Village
was a special area set aside to display the
Amiga and its works in all their glory.
The new machine was put through its
paces for interested groups of visitors
but once again the enormous potential
of the machine seemed to be trivialised,
unless the sight of ﬂying hotdogs turns
on you on!

The Amiga is a but of an enigma at the
moment. I t s  undoubted graphics
capabilities and speed make it an ex-
tremely desirable acquisition for com-
puter buffs, but how will the business
fraternity react. With the long shadow of
IBM being cast across the marketplace I
wonder if the Amiga's glow will shine
brightly enough in the dark.
The general view of showgoers was
that the Amiga will be a very strong con-
tender in the area of Computer Aided
Design. video graphics generation or
even in the publishing world but I've yet
to hear a convincing argument for it in
the business wor ld. Certainly t h e
software on display failed to take my
breath away. Commodore hopes that
I'm wrong and would rather see IBM's
lengthening shadow as a sign that the
sun will soon be setting on its empire,
heralding the rebirth of Commodore as
a force in industry. Only time will tell if
it's a case of welcome back CBM or adios
Amiga.
Classics
The most impressive array of hardware
was displayed by  Viza Software. N o
other company managed to create the
impression of total support for the Com-
modore range. Kelvin Lacey of Viza was
not backward in expressing his surprise
that CBM was giving the impression of
being a one machine company.
On the Viza stand, were displayed
the full range PCs.128Ds and 645 to show
the power of the software. Particularly
impressive was the C128 Viza Classic
Cartridge which must surely be the Rolls
Royce of wordprocessors. The cartridge
gives instant access to the full power of
the program plus the advantages of an 80
column display. Sophistication comes at
a price, however, and in this case it is
f99.95.
Get Smart
Next door to Viza was a rather forlorn
looking area labelled Micropro Inter-
national. Covering the same area as its
neighbour, the stand looked empty
because n o  display equipment had
arrived. For the full weekend the staff
battled bravely to make their presence
felt amongst the empty drinks cans and
other debris which their wide open
spaces seemed to attract. The new pro-
duct was equally as small as their display
area but its signiﬁcance is enormous. For
the ﬁrst time a Smart Card was being
shown running a program on the 64 and
128,
Smart Cards look like normal credit
cards but hidden within their plastic
exterior is a small but powerful micro-
chip. Micropro's application was the
extremely popular SuperScript word-
processor which simply slots into an
adaptor in the cartridge part of the
computer. This gives instant access to
the user at a relatively modest cost of
around i99.
To be Precise
SuperScript is a product from the Preci-
sion Software range. the full strength of
which was being demonstrated next to
the Amiga Village. In all honesty the
demonstration of the precision Amiga
graphics packages upstaged the ofﬁcial
demonstration and visitors to the show
squeezed in to the small display area to
marvel at the wonders on display.
SuperScript and its companion pro-
gram Superbase have now been com-
bined in the 128 so that both programs
can r un concurrently and exchange
information for mailing list applications,
making a very powerful business tool for
the small businessman. For those who
are still struggling with Superbase, help
is at hand with the publication o f
Superbase: The Book and for those who
have given up there is the simpler Super-
base Starter.
US inﬂuence
The appearance of the Amiga has attrac-
ted one or two Stateside companies to
test the water over here. Timeworks is
one such company which was particu-
larly eager to show 128 business software,
Swiltcalc, W o r ld  Wr iter  and Data
Manager will all be appearing during
these summer months. I am particularly
eager to see the Timeworks Sideways
program in operation. This is a spread-
sheet utility which prints text along the
length of printer paper instead of across
the width, saving a lot of the time which
collation and pasting together printout
sheets normally involves.
And Euro Power
The only true software launch at the
show was a utility cartridge from Power
Products which is a Dutch company
marketing its  products through the
auspices o f  Peter Watts' Rainbeck
company in this country. The Power
Cartridge has an impressive array of
facilities not least of which is the fact that
it employs its own external memory and
is transparent t o  the computer. This
means that it does not use a large chunk
of memory which could be better used
for programming.

Bizarre bazaar bargains
When the going
gets tough...
the cartridge offers programming
tool k it commands to 64 Basic, turbo tape
and disk commands, lo w  and high
resolution screen dumps and a machine
code monitor.
At long last cartridges seem to be
coming into vogue for the &land a lot of
this attention can be traced back to
Germany and Holland. Robtek markets
Dutch cartridges amongst its range of
products. T he Robtek 5 0 Cartridge
rarely leaves the cartridge port on my 64
and the Came Killer cartridge is proving
to b e  phenomenonly  successful
amongst the game playing fraternity.
Paul Share of Robtek is not slow to point
out that the company is not short of
ideas for the future. The latest product is
a disk maintenance kit which should
help prevent the need for costly repairs.
Bright Ideas
My own award for technical innovation
at the show must go to Overbase. Bob
Glynn revealed his Thingi to the general
public and everyone agreed that they'd
never seen anything like it. Everyone
wanted one. For around 17 you too can
have a Thingi iust like his. What is it?
When I tell you you'll kick yourself for
not thinking of the idea yourself.
The best way to describe it is that it is
a kind of bulldog clip on a strong plastic'
arm which attaches to the top of your
monitor, The clip will hold a listing or a
piece of text which you want to type into
your computer. Holding the copy up by
your monitor means that eye movement
is kept to a minimum and hopefully
reduces the strain of constantly referring
back and forth from copy to screen.
Simple but very effective, the Thingi
proved very popular at the show and has
the distinction of being compatible with
any make of computed
An alternative use for the Thingi is to
dip a picture of your sweetheart or
spouse (or both) to it so that you don't
forget what they look like!
Opinions
Although some of the big companies
weren't there, PR men seemed to throng
the bars like piglets round a sow's teats.
Grunting and squeaking about their
companies latest 'blockbusters' it gave
hope for the games market but I felt
there was an air of desparation in their
cries. There is no doubt that games sales
generally are not what they used to be.
One little ray of sunshine in this
impending gloom was Mike 'two in the
bush' Baxter of Solutions, once des-
cribed as the most eligible bachelor in
PR and still desparately trying to prove it.
His is the voice of hope when he says
that the full potential o f  the games
market is not being fully realised be-
cause the games market lacks genuine
innovation. I would tend to agree with
this having seen so many 'cloned' games
of late.
And the Sheep
One innovator who has been very quiet
of late is the ungulophilic Jeff Minter.
His new game, tridis Alpha, is still under
development b u t  the demo he had
running looks very interesting, demon-
strating yet another facet o f  mirror
image lateral screen splitting which he
pioneered with Sheep in Space.
Keyed Up
Within sight (and unfortunately sound)
of Llamasoft was  t h e  Commodore
Theatre, aforementioned site o f  the
damp squib Amiga launch. During the
Show several companies used this as a
venue to give full blown demonstrations
of products, but none more effectively
85
than Music Sales. Using Rick Wakeman
and Rick Cardinali as demonstrators, the
full potential of the FM music system was
realised.
Once more Chris Kayday was called
upon to act as Master of Ceremonies
and his performance was quite a con-
trast to his appearance at the press
launch. Life and soul of the party Chris
bounced on to the stage and in his best-
event-of-the-show-style announced the
two Ricks.
The staging could have been better
staged by avoiding extensive views of
Wakeman's rear end but the music was
magic. N ow  ageing gracefully, Rick
Wakeman has divested himself of the
long-haired, caped keyboard crusader
look of his days with Yes and now merely
looks rich. Rick Card inali, in contrast, is
more ﬂamboyant and less rich. Dressed
in a style which he self-confessedly des-
cribes as 'like the Penguin in Batman',
it's a pity that Wakeman n o  longer
employs a cape in his act.
Wakeman and Cardinali make a
highly entertaining double act being
both talented and witty, The audience
sat open-mouthed as Wakeman worked
his magic on the ivories of the Music
System while Cardinali showed the
equally impressive power of Music Sales
Sound Sampler. Even Wakeman's son,
Adam, got a look in and left us all won-
dering if he'd follow in his father's foot-
steps in future years.
The piece de resistance of the show
was a  Commodore r a p  i n  whic h
Cardinali distorted his voice through the
sampler t o give a rich, deep 'black'
sound and then turned up the pace to
make it sound like a Donald Duck rap.
This performance stole the Show for
me, it overshadowed the Amiga demon-
strations a n d  ev en distracted m y
chauvinistic eyes from the inevitable
bevvy o f  beautiful assistants at the
stands,
Overall Impressions
The Show Guide reﬂected my  total
impression of the Show itself. It concen-
trated o n the Amiga and the Music
System with an old recycled review of
the 128. Apart from that and the ads, it
had nothing more to say. All in all, it was
like an extra edition of a certain maga-
zine.
This year the attendance indicated an
upturn in the fortunes of the computer
trade but the games ﬁeld failed to reﬂect
this hope by several noticeable non-
appearances. The attitude of the show
goers was summed up by one youth,
obviously suffering the onset of adoles-
cence. He took a long look at the leggy
blonde handing out the Show cata-
logues and was heard to exclaim, 'Cor,
look at the legs on that', To this his friend
replied, 'Never mind those we came to
look a t  computers!'. Such single-
minded dedication should have been
rewarded with a better showing from
the industry.

Runecaster leads you into
the dark  and complex world
of adventures.
THOSE THOUSANDS OF ADVENTURERS
who cut their teeth on The Hobbit will
probably already have got their copy of
The Lord of the Rings'.
When it is introduced, The Hobbit'
set new standards for adventure games.
Is t h is  lo n g  awaited s equel f r o m
Melbourne House going t o  shine as
brightly?
The suspense of waiting has ﬁnally
given w ay  t o  a n  awed feeling o f
amazement at the size of the program and
the way the main characters can interact.
This is only part one of a three part
trilogy, with the second and third parts
still a long way off. The original story was
published a s  three books and t h e
computer game versions will follow this
pattern. The ﬁrst, based on book one, is
entitled The Fellowship of the Ring.
The program comes on two cassettes
which contain a  cut-down beginner's
game in addition to the two separate parts
of the main adventure, Also included in
the package is the 500 plus page book the
ﬁrst part of the trilogy together with an
excellent instruction booklet.
The beginner's game is well presented
and should prove a good introduction to
adventure gaming. Its responses to the
input 'HELP' are fairly direct and give the
newcomer a  g o o d  id e a  o f  w h a t
adventures ar e all about. The main
adventures d o  n o t  recognise this
command!
Although listed in some quarters as a
graphics adventure, very few pictures
are used in the main game, most appear-
ing in  the beginner's version. What
graphics there are, are not very inspiring
and in no way create the atmosphere
found in The Hobbit,
When starting the game you will be
asked which o f  the four hobbits —
Frodo. Sam, Pippin or Merry—you wish
to control. You may choose oneor more
but whilst playing one character, the
others will generally follow the leader
unless speciﬁcally told to do otherwise.
The screen display resembles a stack
of f o u r  sheets o f  paper  s lightly
displaced, so that in addition to the top
piece, a little of the left hand side of the
three other sheets may also be seen.
Pictures of characters at your present
location are shown at the left on the top
sheet. Main characters elsewhere are
shown on the three sheets underneath.
The g a m e  h a s  m a n y  o f  t h e
ingredients of the original book. Players
who have read The Fellowship of the
Ring will often have a feeling of deja-vu.
Reading the book is recommended as
this game follows the story more closely
than The Hobbit game did. Far from
spoiling the adventure, this adds to the
pleasure for Lord of the Rings fans and
there are still plenty of puzzles to be
solved!
There are plenty o f  locations t o
explore whic h contain nothing o f
special importance in solving the game
but which add a  lot to the general
atmosphere. This greatly increases the
feeling of a role playing game.
There is  much t o  command i n
Melbourne House's latest epic, sadly
there is a darker side to the coin too.
Program operation is desperately slow,
there are a number of fatal bugs that will
cause the program to crash and some of
the responses to input commands are
ludicrous to say the least.
Nearly all actions result in a fair
amount of text being displayed. This
takes some time to appear, no doubt
partially d u e  t o  t he program also
working o u t  w h a t  t h e  v ar ious
independent characters are doing at
that time. Move Frodo to a new location
and the three other hobbits, together
with any other companions, will follow
him in their own good time!
Half a minute between moves is
good going, sometimes over a minute is
required to regain control of the input
cursor to enter your next command! The
program will crash if you go into a dark
place without matches to light your way
and I've heard reports of other situations
that give a similar result.
Such is a complexity of the game that
it is not possible to QUIT and just start
from the beginning — you must reload
the program from scratch. This can be
overcome to some extent by frequent
SAVEings of your game position on a
separate data tape but again this process
does tend t o  slow t he game play
somewhat.
Complex in p u t  commands ar e
accepted, a s  i s  talk ing t o  other
characters (a necessity on occasions).
With such a complicated parser it is
perhaps not surprising that some strange
responses are produced but it can be a
bit annoying when an item passed from

A d v e n t u r e s
one hobbit to another is lost in the
process!
For all its faults The Lord of the Rings
is a marvellous game for anyone with the
blood of Middle Earth in their veins.
Newcomers t o this wonderful world
may well despair but those of us who
have waited for further hobbit travels
from the Shire will sit back and enjoy the
experience.
Americana
Although there have been some notable
releases of adventure games from UK
writers in  the last few months, the
continuing trickle of American imports
is most welcome. Activision's release of
the cassette version of 'Mindshadow'
seems t o have made other software
houses aware of the gains to be made by
having games available on something
other than disk.
US Gold has recently launched an
updated version of an old favourite on
both disk and cassette for the C 64/128
— Asylum. This gained popularity some
years ago as a crude, but successful,
graphics adventure for the ISR 80 as
Asylum I. It was followed by a slightly
easier version Asylum I I  b u t  w ith
basically the same plot.
This new version seems to be an
improved version of  Asylum II, with
good graphics and a very devious 3-D
maze of corridors and rooms that you
must map (with difﬁculty!) and explore.
Escaping eventually through the one
and only exit available to you.
The theme is that you have been 'put
away' after being found wanderig the
streets muttering such phrases as "Take
the book and drop the candle" and
"Slay the dragon with the sword".
Sounds familiar doesn't it!
The door to your room has been
inadvertently left unlocked and you
must try to ﬁnd a way to escape. Dressing
up as  a  doctor seems t o  b e  t he
recommended method but ﬁrst you
must ﬁnd the necessary objects to give
your disguise authenticity.
Doors to other rooms will be locked
but electronic keys can be found to
unlock them, Having opened and
examined the contents of these rooms
you must remember to close the doors
behind you — too many doors left open
will set off the alarms!
If my memory serves me correctly
the original Asylum I I  had random
alarms connected to some doors but this
version has not yet caught me that way!
On entering a room, you may ﬁnd a box
containing something useful — pick it
up and the box disappears, put it down
and it reappears in its box!
You may also hide things under the
furniture but remember where you put
them because ther e w i l l  b e  n o
indication of their hiding place once
you've set them down. The vocabulary is
extensive and may be viewed at any time
by pressing function key H. Key F2 will
present a 'slide show' of some of the
pictures you rn.iy ﬁnd on your travels.
Input commands recognised ar e
fairly comprehensive allowing such as:
"DROP EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE BIRD
COSTUME
INMATES AXE" and "GET MAGNET,
KNIFE AND SILVER CARD". Several
commonly used words are recognised
by their initial letter, which saves a great
deal of typing. " 0  D W CARD" is a lot
quicker than typing "OPEN DOOR
WITH CARD".
The graphics are good hi-res pictures
and are at their best when you enter
special rooms or meet various characters
in the corridors. You may move around
the corridors by using the cursor keys for
turning left or right and the up arrow key
for m o v i n g  for war ds . Ex amine
everything, you never know what or
where anything useful may be hidden
but never "LOOK LIP", true to the
original version, something unexpected
may fall on your head!
It certainly looks as though this
program has been given a new lease of
life. US Gold should be congratulated
on this  'resurrection program' f o r
marketing greatly improved versions of
some of the home computer's classic
games: The Temple of Apshai Trilogy
and now 'Asylum'. What next?
Team Play
Fancy a multi-player adventure game?
The Causes of Chaos from CRL offers the
opportunity of a six player game. You
can either band together or wage war on
each other as the mood takes you.
Working in unison seems the way to go,
as otherwise someone will have to sit
there with their eyes shut!
The game is a fairly basic text only
adventure, with the aim being to ﬁnd six
stolen royal treasures. At the beginning
you must enter how many are to play,
their names and how many turns each is
allowed ( one t o  nine). T he input
87
command is of the type verb/noun and
the game does not appear to have a very
large vocabulary.
If another player is present you may
attack him (or her). The outcome of each
'round' is determined by who presses a
key ﬁrst and their present status —
weapon skill, hit points remaining etc. A
reasonable system but not exactly kind
to your computer's numeric keys!
The game is a little difﬁcult to get into
with only a few locations accessible at
the start, location descriptions are brief
and the exits vary slightly if the one
player game has been chosen! There are
a series of help messages but generally
the text is a little thin.
CRL has a  good reputation f o r
software but The Causes of Chaos is
below normal standard and is certainly
not going to get into any top ten.
Last of a Line
Taskset has produced some good arcade
games in the past few years and now this
company has  launc hed it s  ﬁr s t
adventure Souls of Darkon. It is also the
last game as Taskset has gone the way of
many promising software houses and no
longer exists b u t  this game is  still
available.
Souls of Darkon is a text and graphics
adventure which players will love or
hate. Yes one of those! It has a fairly
standard plot, where you, the hero, will
hopefully free the world from its evil
overlord Darkon. The world is the planet
Megron, y ou ar e 'bionic ' and ar e
accompanied b y  a  r o b o t  c alled
Komputa!
There is a strange mixture of ancient
and modern with anti-gravity belts as
well as swords and maces. Make the
most of what you can ﬁnd, for there are
plenty of things hidden in this game,
over 15 possibly useful objects in the ﬁrSt
10 locations!
There is a text panel at the top of the
screen that describes your immediate
surroundings — but not what may be
lying around for you to pick up. Below,
the screen is split, with a hi-res two
colour picture on the left and on the
right a  scrolling tex t window that
displays t h e  replies t o  y our  input
commands.
Multi-word commands of the type
'ATTACK THE MAN WITH THE SWORD'
are accepted but the vocabulary is
limited. 'VOCAB' or 'V' will display a list
of the verbs that are understood and this
will often be scanned in the hope of
ﬁnding the right word.
You are not always told what you
might have unconvered, frequent use of
'LOOK' is to be recommended. 'HELP' is
recognised by the parser and does not
bring any  immediate assistance but
'LEGEND' will produce various useful
but cryptic messages.
Each step seems to involve a puzzle
and you may feel that some of these are
somewhat c ontr iv ed. T her e a r e
characters to meet but the vocabulary
limits any great interaction! Deﬁnitely

A d v e n t u r e s
not a game for the novice adventurer as
progress is  restricted t o  very f e w
locations until a number of puzzles have
been solved.
Communicate
Playing adventures may not be the most
popular use for a home computer but it
certainly has a following that is both
large and growing. There are adventure
columns in nearly every magazine and a
growing number  o f  independent,
privately p r o d u c e d ,  d e d ic a t e d
adventure mags.
The independents  ar e usually
photocopied affairs crammed w ith
news, views and reviews. You may think
that with so many people all looking at
the same source material that they
would all be repealing the same things
about the same games — not so. Each
reviewer has his own ideas as to what
makes a game a winner or a loser.
Some games stand out from the pack,
while others f a ll b y  t h e  wayside
completely. Fortunately the latter are
getting fewer. But although the appeal
of adventures is  widespread, n o t
everybody likes to play the same type of
game. The trick is to ﬁnd the reviewer
who has a similar taste to yourself.
Adventure columns should be as
impartial as  possible w ith a  good
reviewer having spent a fair time trying
to solve the adventures he reviews. We

probably that of the Adventurers Club

development is becoming more and
more popular with computer users —
electronic mail, bulletin boards and
special interest groups.

All these and more, are the outcome
of linking your computer via a modem
to many of the free networks set up
around t h e  country. Modems  ar e
becoming cheaper and often come with
a list of phone numbers that will give you
access t o  several o f  these bulletin
boards.
There are many topics covered,
ranging from where to eat to alternative
medicine! Quite a few have adventure
clues and/or  t h e  facility t o  leave
messages requesting help. Another
aspect of this form of communication is
access to adventure games themselves,
where the program can be downloaded
directly into your own computer.
For some networks you have to pay a
regular subscription b u t  ther e ar e
usually some features that make this
worthwhile. Buy a Commodore modem
and you will probably also get a limited
free sub to Compunet. They offer all the
usual bulletin board facilities plus much
more.
There are even a number of well
known games (Level Nine for instance),
available f o r  downloading f r o m
Corn punet at less than the normal retail
price. These have the added advantage
of being disk based even if those in the
shops were only on cassette. Having
once got a modem there may even be
the temptation to join in some real-time
advetures with other modem users.

messages to the garrison headquarters.
As you travel through the scrolling landscapes,
you will be under constant ﬁre from the tribesmen bent on
reaching the fort. Y ou will have to use your machine gun with great skill
to get past them. There are seven separate areas of scrolling landscapes before
the fort can be reached and each area requires increasing skill.

BONGO Cr I l uSTRucTI O N SET
Bongo Construction Set is a hilarious family game. Bongo
is trying to reach the princess, hotly pursued by monsters.
He uses ladders, slides, transporters, lifts and trampolines
to elude his pursuers but they seem to know his moves
before he makes them. There are six stages with ﬁve skill
levels. You can design your ow n stages using the joystick
and save them on cassette or disk to play later.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT were very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet' Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTFR f s the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!
SUPERSOFT, Winchester House, Canning Road,

Telephone: 01.861 1166
Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!), The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands: or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really corn-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIR, QUM(
and KAMI-KAZE in our range v%,e are one of
the m a
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be In use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order) However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
