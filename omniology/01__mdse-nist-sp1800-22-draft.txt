Executive Summary 
1 
Many organizations now provide employees the flexibility to use their personal mobile devices to 
2 
perform work-related activities. An ineffectively secured personal mobile device could expose an 
3 
organization or employee to data loss or a privacy compromise. Ensuring that an organization’s data is 
4 
protected when it is accessed from personal devices poses unique challenges and threats. 
5 
Allowing employees to use their personal mobile devices for work-related activities is commonly known 
6 
as a bring your own device (BYOD) deployment. A BYOD deployment offers a convenient way to 
7 
remotely access organizational resources, while avoiding the alternative of carrying both a work phone 
8 
and personal phone. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates how organizations can use 
9 
standards-based, commercially available products to help meet their BYOD security and privacy needs. 
10 
CHALLENGE 
11 
BYOD devices can be used interchangeably for 
12 
work and personal purposes throughout the day. 
13 
While flexible and convenient, BYOD can introduce 
14 
challenges to an enterprise. These challenges can 
15 
include additional responsibilities and complexity 
16 
for information technology (IT) departments 
17 
caused by supporting many types of personal mobile devices used by the employees, enterprise security 
18 
threats arising from unprotected personal devices, as well as challenges protecting the privacy of 
19 
employees and their personal data stored on their mobile devices.  
20 
SOLUTION 
21 
The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) collaborated with the mobile device 
22 
community and cybersecurity technology providers to build a simulated BYOD environment. Using 
23 
commercially available products, the example solution’s technologies and methodologies can enhance 
24 
the security posture of the adopting organization and help protect employee privacy and organizational 
25 
information assets.  
26 
An ineffectively secured personal mobile device 
could expose an organization or employee to data 
loss or a privacy compromise 
This practice guide can help your organization: 
 
protect data from being accessed by unauthorized persons when a device is stolen or misplaced 
 
reduce risk to employees through enhanced privacy protections 
 
improve the security of mobile devices and applications by deploying mobile device technologies  
 
reduce risks to organizational data by separating personal and work-related information from 
each other 
 
enhance visibility into mobile device health to facilitate identification of device and data 
compromise, and permit efficient user notification  
 
leverage industry best practices to enhance mobile device security and privacy

NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE 
21 
The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), a part of the National Institute of Standards 
22 
and Technology (NIST), is a collaborative hub where industry organizations, government agencies, and 
23 
academic institutions work together to address businesses’ most pressing cybersecurity issues. This 
24 
public-private partnership enables the creation of practical cybersecurity solutions for specific 
25 
industries, as well as for broad, cross-sector technology challenges. Through consortia under 
26 
Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), including technology partners—from 
27 
Fortune 50 market leaders to smaller companies specializing in information technology security—the 
28 
NCCoE applies standards and best practices to develop modular, easily adaptable example cybersecurity 
29 
solutions using commercially available technology. The NCCoE documents these example solutions in 
30 
the NIST Special Publication 1800 series, which maps capabilities to the NIST Cyber Security Framework 
31 
and details the steps needed for another entity to recreate the example solution. The NCCoE was 
32 
established in 2012 by NIST in partnership with the State of Maryland and Montgomery County, Md.

NIST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICE GUIDES 
36 
NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guides (Special Publication Series 1800) target specific cybersecurity 
37 
challenges in the public and private sectors. They are practical, user-friendly guides that facilitate the 
38 
adoption of standards-based approaches to cybersecurity. They show members of the information 
39 
security community how to implement example solutions that help them align with relevant standards 
40 
and best practices, and provide users with the materials lists, configuration files, and other information 
41 
they need to implement a similar approach. 
42 
The documents in this series describe example implementations of cybersecurity practices that 
43 
businesses and other organizations may voluntarily adopt. These documents do not describe regulations 
44 
or mandatory practices, nor do they carry statutory authority.  
45 
ABSTRACT 
46 
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) refers to the practice of performing work-related activities on personally 
47 
owned devices. This practice guide provides an example solution demonstrating how to enhance 
48 
security and privacy in Android and Apple smartphone BYOD deployments.  
49 
Incorporating BYOD capabilities into an organization can provide greater flexibility in how employees 
50 
work and increase the opportunities and methods available to access organizational resources. For some 
51 
organizations, the combination of traditional in-office processes with mobile device technologies 
52 
enables portable communication approaches and adaptive workflows. For others, it fosters a mobile-
53 
first approach in which their employees communicate and collaborate primarily using their mobile 
54 
devices. 
55

NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
iii 
However, some of the features that make BYOD mobile devices increasingly flexible and functional also 
56 
present unique security and privacy challenges to both work organizations and device owners. The 
57 
unique nature of these challenges is driven by the diverse range of devices available that vary in type, 
58 
age, operating system (OS), and the level of risk posed. 
59 
Enabling BYOD capabilities in the enterprise introduces new cybersecurity risks to organizations. 
60 
Solutions that are designed to secure corporate devices and on-premises data do not provide an 
61 
effective cybersecurity solution for BYOD. Finding an effective solution can be challenging due to the 
62 
unique risks that BYOD deployments impose. Additionally, enabling BYOD capabilities introduces new 
63 
privacy risks to employees by providing their employer a degree of access to their personal devices, 
64 
opening up the possibility of observation and control that would not otherwise exist. 
65 
To help organizations benefit from BYOD’s flexibility while protecting themselves from many of its 
66 
critical security and privacy challenges, this Practice Guide provides an example solution using 
67 
standards-based, commercially available products and step-by-step implementation guidance.

1 Summary 
254 
This section familiarizes the reader with 
255 
 
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) concepts 
256 
 
Challenges, solutions, and benefits related to BYOD deployments 
257 
BYOD refers to the practice of performing work-related activities on personally owned devices. This 
258 
practice guide provides an example solution demonstrating how to enhance security and privacy in 
259 
Android and Apple mobile phone BYOD deployments.  
260 
Incorporating BYOD capabilities in an organization can provide greater flexibility in how employees work 
261 
and can increase the opportunities and methods available to access organizational resources. For some 
262 
organizations, the combination of in-office processes with mobile device technologies enables portable 
263 
communication approaches and adaptive workflows. Other organizations may adopt a mobile-first 
264 
approach in which their employees communicate and collaborate primarily using their mobile devices. 
265 
Extending mobile device use by enabling BYOD capabilities in the enterprise can introduce new 
266 
information technology (IT) risks to organizations. Solutions that are designed to help secure corporate 
267 
devices and the data located on those corporate devices do not always provide an effective 
268 
cybersecurity solution for BYOD. 
269 
Deploying effective solutions can be challenging due to the unique risks that BYOD deployments impose. 
270 
Some of the features that make personal mobile devices increasingly flexible and functional also present 
271 
unique security and privacy challenges to both employers and device owners.  
272 
Additionally, enabling BYOD capabilities can introduce new privacy risks to employees by providing their 
273 
employer a degree of access to their personal devices, opening the possibility of mobile device 
274 
observation and control that would not otherwise exist. 
275 
This practice guide helps organizations deploy BYOD capabilities by providing an example solution that 
276 
helps address BYOD challenges, solutions, and benefits. In this practice guide, the term mobile phone is 
277 
used to describe an Apple iOS or Android mobile telephone device. Additionally, this practice guide's 
278 
scope for BYOD does not include the deployment of laptops or devices similar to laptops. 
279 
1.1 Challenge 
280 
Many organizations now authorize employees to use their personal mobile devices to perform work-
281 
related activities. This provides employees with increased flexibility to access organizational information 
282 
resources. However, BYOD architectures can also introduce vulnerabilities in the enterprise’s IT 
283 
infrastructure because personally owned mobile devices are typically unmanaged and may lack mobile 
284 
device security protections. Unmanaged devices are at greater risk of unauthorized access to sensitive 
285 
information, email phishing, eavesdropping, misuse of device sensors, or compromise of organizational 
286 
data due to lost devices to name but a few risks. 
287

BYOD deployment challenges can include: 
288 
Supporting a broad ecosystem of mobile devices 
289 
 
with diverse technologies that rapidly evolve and vary in manufacturer, operating system (OS), 
290 
and age of the device 
291 
 
where each device has unique security and privacy requirements and capabilities 
292 
 
whose variety can present interoperability issues that might affect organizational integration 
293 
Reducing organizational risk and threats to the enterprise’s sensitive information  
294 
 
posed by applications like games that may not usually be installed on devices issued by an 
295 
organization  
296 
 
that result from lost, stolen, or sold mobile devices that still contain or have access to 
297 
organizational data 
298 
 
created by a user who shares their personally owned device with friends and family members 
299 
when that personally owned device may also be used for work activities 
300 
 
due to personally owned mobile devices being taken to places that increase the risk of loss of 
301 
control for the device  
302 
 
that result from malicious applications compromising the device and subsequently the data to 
303 
which the device has access 
304 
 
produced by network-based attacks that can traverse a device’s always-on connection to the 
305 
internet 
306 
 
caused by phishing attempts that try to collect user credentials or entice a user to install 
307 
malicious software 
308 
Protecting the privacy of employees 
309 
 
by helping to keep their personal photos, documents, and other data private and inaccessible to 
310 
others (including the organization) 
311 
 
by helping to ensure separation between their work and personal data while simultaneously 
312 
meeting the organization’s objectives for business functions, usability, security, and employee 
313 
privacy  
314 
 
by providing them with concise and understandable information about what data is collected 
315 
and what actions are allowed and disallowed on their devices 
316 
Clearly communicating BYOD concepts 
317 
 
among an organization’s information technology team so it can develop the architecture to 
318 
address BYOD’s unique security and privacy concerns while using a repeatable, standardized, 
319 
and clearly communicated risk framework language 
320 
 
to organizational leadership and employees to obtain support in deploying BYOD 
321

 
related to mobile device security technologies so that the organization can consistently plan for 
322 
and implement the protection capabilities of their security tools 
323 
Given these challenges, it can be complex to manage the security and privacy aspects of personally 
324 
owned mobile devices that access organizational information assets. This document provides an 
325 
example solution to help organizations address these challenges. 
326 
1.2 Solution 
327 
To help organizations benefit from BYOD’s flexibility while protecting themselves from many of its 
328 
critical security and privacy challenges, this National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
329 
Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides an example solution using standards-based, commercially 
330 
available products and step-by-step implementation guidance. 
331 
In our lab at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), engineers built an environment 
332 
that contains an example solution for managing the security and privacy of BYOD deployments. In this 
333 
guide, we show how an enterprise can leverage the concepts presented in this example solution to 
334 
implement enterprise mobility management (EMM), mobile threat defense (MTD), application vetting, a 
335 
trusted execution environment (TEE) supporting secure boot/image authentication, and virtual private 
336 
network (VPN) services to support a BYOD solution. 
337 
We configured these technologies to protect organizational assets and employee privacy and provide 
338 
methodologies to enhance the data protection posture of the adopting organization. The standards and 
339 
best practices on which this example solution is based help ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and 
340 
availability of enterprise data on BYOD Android and Apple mobile phones as well as the predictability, 
341 
manageability, and disassociability of employee’s data. 
342 
The example solution in this practice guide helps 
343 
 
detect and protect against installing mobile malware, phishing attempts, and network-based 
344 
attacks 
345 
 
enforce passcode usage 
346 
 
protect organizational data by enabling selective device wipe capability of organizational data 
347 
and applications 
348 
 
protect against organizational data loss by restricting an employee’s ability to copy and paste, 
349 
perform a screen capture, or store organizational data in unapproved locations 
350 
 
organizations view BYOD risks and remediate threats (e.g., risks from jailbroken or rooted 
351 
devices) 
352 
 
provide users with access to protected business resources (e.g., SharePoint, knowledge base, 
353 
internal wikis, application data) 
354 
 
support executed code authenticity, runtime state integrity, and persistent memory data 
355 
confidentiality 
356 
 
protect data from eavesdropping while traversing a network 
357

 
vet the security of mobile applications used for work-related activities 
358 
 
organizations implement settings to protect employee privacy 
359 
 
an organization deploy its own BYOD solution by providing a series of how-to guides—step-by-
360 
step instructions covering the initial setup (installation or provisioning) and configuration for 
361 
each component of the architecture—to help security and privacy engineers rapidly deploy and 
362 
evaluate a mobile device solution in their test environment 
363 
Commercial, standards-based products such as the ones used in this practice guide are readily available 
364 
and interoperable with existing IT infrastructure and investments. Organizations can use this guidance in 
365 
whole or in part to help understand and mitigate common BYOD security and privacy challenges.  
366 
1.2.1 Standards and Guidance  
367 
This guide leverages many standards and guidance, including the NIST Framework for Improving Critical 
368 
Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.1 (Cybersecurity Framework) [1], the NIST Privacy Framework: A 
369 
Tool For Improving Privacy Through Enterprise Risk Management, Version 1.0 (Privacy Framework) [2], 
370 
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-181 National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity 
371 
Workforce Framework (2017) [3], the NIST Risk Management Framework [4], and the NIST Mobile 
372 
Threat Catalogue [5]. For additional information, see Appendix D, Standards and Guidance.  
373 
1.3 Benefits 
374 
Carrying two mobile devices, one for work and one for personal use, introduces inconveniences and 
375 
disadvantages that some organizations and employees are looking to avoid. Recognizing that BYOD is 
376 
being adopted, the NCCoE worked to provide organizations with guidance for improving the security and 
377 
privacy of these solutions.  
378 
For organizations, the potential benefits of this example solution include 
379 
 
enhanced protection against both malicious applications and loss of data if a device is stolen or 
380 
misplaced 
381 
 
reduced adverse effects if a device is compromised 
382 
 
visibility for system administrators into mobile security compliance, enabling automated 
383 
identification and notification of a compromised device 
384 
 
a vendor-agnostic, modular architecture based on technology roles 
385 
 
demonstrated enhanced security options for mobile access to organizational resources such as 
386 
intranet, email, contacts, and calendar 
387 
For employees, the potential benefits of this example solution include 
388 
 
safeguards to help protect their privacy 
389 
 
better protected personal devices by screening work applications for malicious capability before 
390 
installing them

You might share the Executive Summary, NIST SP 1800-22A, with your leadership team members to help 
424 
them understand the importance of adopting standards-based BYOD deployments. 
425 
IT professionals who want to implement an approach like this will find the whole practice guide useful. 
426 
You can use the how-to portion of the guide, NIST SP 1800-22C, to replicate all or parts of the build 
427 
created in our lab. The how-to portion of the guide provides specific product installation, configuration, 
428 
and integration instructions for implementing the example solution. We do not re-create the product 
429 
manufacturers’ documentation, which is generally widely available. Rather, we show how we 
430 
incorporated the products together in our environment to create an example solution. 
431 
This guide assumes that IT professionals have experience implementing security products within the 
432 
enterprise. While we have used a suite of commercial products to address this challenge, this guide does 
433 
not endorse these particular products. Your organization can adopt this solution or one that adheres to 
434 
these guidelines in whole, or you can use this guide as a starting point for tailoring and implementing 
435 
parts of this guide’s example solution for BYOD security management. Your organization’s security 
436 
experts should identify the products that will effectively address the BYOD risks identified for your 
437 
organization and best integrate with your existing tools and IT system infrastructure. We hope that you 
438 
will seek products that are congruent with applicable standards and best practices. Section 4.3, 
439 
Technologies that Support the Security and Privacy Goals of the Example Solution, lists the products we 
440 
used and maps them to the cybersecurity controls provided by this reference solution. 
441 
For those who would like to see how the example solution can be implemented, this practice guide 
442 
contains an example scenario about a fictional company called Great Seneca Accounting. The example 
443 
scenario shows how BYOD objectives can align with an organization’s priority security and privacy 
444 
capabilities through NIST risk management standards, guidance, and tools. It is provided in this practice 
445 
guide’s supplement, Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice. 
446 
 
Appendix F of the Supplement, describes the risk analysis we performed, using an example 
447 
scenario. 
448 
 
Appendix G of the Supplement, describes how to conduct a privacy risk assessment and use it to 
449 
improve mobile device architectures, using an example scenario.

3 Approach 
458 
This section familiarizes the reader with 
459 
 
this guide’s intended audience, scope, and assumptions 
460 
 
mobile device security and privacy risk assessments 
461 
To identify the cybersecurity challenges associated with deploying a BYOD solution, the team surveyed 
462 
reports of mobile device security trends and invited the mobile device security community to engage in 
463 
a discussion about pressing cybersecurity challenges. 
464 
Two broad and significant themes emerged from this research: 
465 
 
Administrators wanted to better understand what policies and standards should be 
466 
implemented.  
467 
 
Employees were concerned about the degree to which enterprises have control over their 
468 
personally owned mobile devices and might have visibility into the personal activity that takes 
469 
place on them.  
470 
The team addressed these two challenges by reviewing the primary standards, best practices, and 
471 
guidelines contained within Appendix D, Standards and Guidance. 
472 
3.1 Audience 
473 
This practice guide is intended for organizations that want to adopt a BYOD architecture that enables 
474 
use of personal mobile phones and tablets. The target audience is executives, security managers, privacy 
475 
managers, engineers, administrators, and others who are responsible for acquiring, implementing, 
476

communicating with users about, or maintaining mobile enterprise technology. This technology can 
477 
include centralized device management, secure device/application security contexts, application vetting, 
478 
and endpoint protection systems. 
479 
This document will interest system architects already managing mobile device deployments and those 
480 
looking to integrate a BYOD architecture into existing organizational wireless systems. It assumes that 
481 
readers have a basic understanding of mobile device technologies and enterprise security and privacy 
482 
principles. Please refer to Section 2 for how different audiences can effectively use this guide. 
483 
3.2 Scope 
484 
The scope of this build includes managing Apple or Android mobile phones and tablets deployed in a 
485 
BYOD configuration with cloud-based EMM. We excluded laptops and mobile devices with minimal 
486 
computing capability, including feature phones, and wearables. We also do not address classified 
487 
systems, devices, data, and applications within this publication. 
488 
While this document is primarily about mobile device security for BYOD implementations, BYOD 
489 
introduces privacy risk to the organization and its employees who participate in the BYOD program. 
490 
Therefore, the NCCoE found addressing privacy risk to be a necessary part of developing the BYOD 
491 
architecture. The scope of privacy in this build is limited to those employees who use their devices as 
492 
part of their organization’s BYOD solution. The build does not explicitly address privacy considerations of 
493 
other individuals whose information is processed by the organization through an employee’s personal 
494 
device. 
495 
We intend for the example solution proposed in this practice guide to be broadly applicable to 
496 
enterprises, including both the public and private sectors. 
497 
3.3 Assumptions 
498 
This project is guided by the following assumptions: 
499 
 
The example solution was developed in a lab environment. While the environment is based on a 
500 
typical organization’s IT enterprise, the example solution does not reflect the complexity of a 
501 
production environment. 
502 
 
The organization has access to the skills and resources required to implement a mobile device 
503 
security and privacy solution. 
504 
 
The example security and privacy control mappings provided as part of this practice guide are 
505 
focused on mobile device needs, and do not include general control mappings that would also 
506 
typically be used in an enterprise. Those general control mappings that do not specifically apply 
507 
to this guide’s mobile device security example solution are outside the scope of this guide’s 
508 
example solution. 
509 
 
Because the organizational environment in which this build could be implemented represents a 
510 
greater level of complexity than is captured in the current guide, we assume that organizations 
511 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
9 
will first examine the implications for their current environment before implementing any part 
512 
of the proposed example solution.  
513 
 
The organization has either already invested or is willing to invest in the security of mobile 
514 
devices used within it and in the privacy of participating employees, and in the organization’s IT 
515 
systems more broadly. As such, we assume that the organization either has the technology in 
516 
place to support this implementation or has access to the off-the shelf technology used in this 
517 
build, which we assume will perform as described by the respective product vendor.  
518 
 
The organization has familiarized itself with existing standards and any associated guidelines 
519 
(e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework [1]; NIST Privacy Framework [2]; NIST SP 800-124 Revision 2 
520 
(Draft), Guidelines for Managing the Security of Mobile Devices in the Enterprise [6]; NIST SP 
521 
1800-4 Mobile Device Security: Cloud and Hybrid Builds [7]) relevant to implementation of the 
522 
example solution proposed in this practice guide. We also assume that any existing technology 
523 
used in the example solution has been implemented in a manner consistent with these 
524 
standards.  
525 
 
The organization has instituted relevant mobile device security and privacy policies, and these 
526 
will be updated based on implementation of this example solution. 
527 
 
The organization will provide guidance and training to its employees regarding BYOD usage and 
528 
how to report device loss or suspected security issues in which their devices are involved. This 
529 
guidance will be periodically reviewed and updated, and employees will be regularly trained on 
530 
BYOD usage. 
531 
3.4 Risk Assessment 
532 
NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, states that risk is “a measure of the 
533 
extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: 
534 
(i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of 
535 
occurrence.” The guide further defines risk assessment as “the process of identifying, estimating, and 
536 
prioritizing risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), 
537 
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation of 
538 
an information system. Part of risk management incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses, and 
539 
considers mitigations provided by security controls planned or in place.” 
540 
The NCCoE recommends that any discussion of risk management, particularly at the enterprise level, 
541 
begins with a comprehensive review of NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for 
542 
Information Systems and Organizations—material that is available to the public. The Risk Management 
543 
Framework (RMF) guidance, as a whole, proved to be invaluable in giving us a baseline to assess risks, 
544 
from which we developed the project, the security characteristics of the build, and this guide. 
545 
We identified the security and privacy risks for this BYOD example solution by examining the 
546 
relationship of risk between cybersecurity and privacy. Cybersecurity and privacy are two distinct risk 
547 
areas, though the two intersect in significant ways. As noted in Section 1.2.1 of the NIST Privacy 
548 
Framework [2], having a general understanding of the different origins of cybersecurity and privacy risks 
549 
is important for determining the most effective solutions to address the risks. Figure 3-1 illustrates this 
550 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
10 
relationship, showing that some privacy risks arise from cybersecurity risks, and some are unrelated to 
551 
cybersecurity risks. Allowing an unauthorized device to connect to the organization’s network through 
552 
its BYOD implementation is an example of a security risk that may not impact privacy.  
553 
An example of a security risk that may also be considered a privacy risk is an employer having increased 
554 
access to an employee’s personal use applications such as personal contacts and personal calendars on 
555 
their device. An example of a privacy risk that is not driven by a security risk is a BYOD implementation 
556 
being used to track employee location, which may reveal information about the places they visit. 
557 
Figure 3-1 Cybersecurity and Privacy Risk Relationship 
558 
 
559 
The security capabilities in this build help address some of the privacy risks that arise for employees. 
560 
This build also uses the NIST Privacy Framework [2] and Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM) 
561 
[8] to identify and address privacy risks that are beyond the scope of security risks. Regardless of 
562 
whether cybersecurity and privacy are situated in the same part of the organization or in different parts, 
563 
the two capabilities must work closely together to address BYOD risks. 
564 
A risk assessment can include additional analysis areas. For more information on the example solution’s:

4.1 Understanding Common BYOD Architecture Threats and the Example 
583 
Solution’s Goals to Remediate Those Threats 
584 
This section contains examples of common security and privacy concerns in BYOD architectures. We 
585 
provide a list of goals to address those challenges. Once completed, the architecture provides 
586 
organizations with a security and privacy-enhanced design for their mobile devices. The example 
587 
solution’s challenges and goals are highlighted below, followed by the architecture that supports those 
588 
goals. 
589 
4.1.1 Threat Events 
590 
Leveraging a system life cycle approach [9], this build considered threats relating to BYOD deployments. 
591 
Information from the Open Web Application Security Project Mobile Top 10 [10], which provides a 
592 
consolidated list of mobile application risks, and information from the NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue [5], 
593 
which examines the mobile information system threats in the broader mobile ecosystem were used to 
594 
develop applicable threats. Table 4-1 gives each threat an identifier for the purposes of this build, a 
595 
description of each threat event (TE), and the related NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue Threat identifiers 
596 
(IDs).  
597 
We limited inclusion of threat events to those that we generally expected to have a high likelihood of 
598 
occurrence and high potential for adverse impact. Organizations applying this build should evaluate the 
599 
NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue for additional threats that may be relevant to their architecture. For an 
600 
example of how to determine the risk from these threats, see Appendix F in the Supplement.

4.1.2 Privacy Problematic Data Actions 
603 
This build also considered operational activities of the example solution that interact with employee 
604 
data during BYOD processes (“data actions”). Additionally, it identified those that potentially cause 
605 
privacy-related problems for individuals (“problematic data actions”). Problematic data actions (PDAs) 
606 
are those actions that may cause an adverse effect for individuals.  
607 
The NIST PRAM [8] and accompanying Catalog of Problematic Data Actions and Problems [11] were used 
608 
to conduct this analysis. Table 4-2 provides the results of this analysis. See Appendix G of the 
609 
Supplement for an example of determining the privacy risks based on these data actions.

Unwarranted restriction: 
Blocking device access or wiping devices entirely may 
result in loss of personal data, which can cause em-
ployee loss of autonomy in their interactions with their 
device, economic loss to recover personal data, or loss 
of trust in the organization’s BYOD implementation.

The BYOD infrastructure

tors device interactions 
related to enterprise 
connectivity and data 
processing. 
Surveillance:  
Monitoring BYOD resources on personal devices pro-
vides a degree of visibility into personal devices that 
employers would not otherwise have, which in turn can 
result in the employer creating an incomplete narrative 
about employees that could lead to issues such as dis-
crimination or employee loss of trust in the employer if 
the employee discovers unanticipated monitoring. Ad-
ditionally, employees who connect their personal mo-
bile device to the organization’s network may not be 
aware of the degree of visibility into their personal ac-
tivities and data and may not want this to occur. For ex-
ample, employers may be able to collect location infor-
mation or application data that provides insights into 
employee health. Employees may feel as though they 
are being surveilled. 
PDA-3 
Data about individuals 
and their devices flows 
between various appli-
cations and analytical 
tools, some of which 
may be shared with 
third parties and pub-
licly. 
Unanticipated revelation: 
Transmission of employee device information and per-
sonal data to the employer and third parties beyond 
the employer may occur through monitoring, data shar-
ing across parties for analytics, and other operational 
purposes. Administrator and co-worker awareness of 
otherwise private activities on devices may reveal infor-
mation about employees that results in dignity losses, 
such as embarrassment or emotional distress.  
 
Data transmission about individuals and their devices 
among a variety of different parties could be confusing 
for employees who might not know who has access to 
information about them. This transmission could reveal 
personal information about the employee to parties 
they would not expect to have such information. This 
lack of employee visibility and awareness of data-shar-
ing practices may also cause employee loss of trust in 
the employer. 
 
4.1.3 Security and Privacy Goals 
612 
To address the challenges stated in the previous sections, the architecture for this build addresses the 
613 
high-level security and privacy goals illustrated in Figure 4-1. 
614 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
14 
Figure 4-1 Security and Privacy Goals 
615 
 
The following goals were highlighted above in Figure 4-1 Security and Privacy Goals, with a green 
616 
exclamation mark: 
617 
1. Separate organization and personal information. BYOD deployments can place 
618 
organizational data at risk by allowing it to travel outside internal networks and systems 
619 
when it is accessed on a personal device. BYOD deployments can also place personal 
620 
data at risk by capturing information from employee devices. To help mitigate this, 
621 
organizational and personal information can be separated by restricting data flow 
622 
between organizationally managed and unmanaged applications. The goals include 
623 
helping to prevent sensitive data from crossing between work and personal contexts. 
624 
2. Encrypt data in transit. Devices deployed in BYOD scenarios can leverage nonsecure 
625 
networks, putting data at risk of interception. To help mitigate this, mobile devices can 
626 
connect to the organization over a VPN or similar solution to encrypt all data before it is 
627 
transmitted from the device, protecting otherwise unencrypted data from interception. 
628 
A user would not be able to access the organization’s resources without an active VPN 
629 
connection and required certificates. 
630 
3. Identify vulnerable applications. Employees may install a wide range of applications on 
631 
their personally owned devices, some of which may have security weaknesses. When 
632 
vulnerable personal applications are identified, an organization can remove the 
633 
employee’s work profile or configuration file from the device rather than uninstalling the 
634 
employee’s personal applications. 
635 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
15 
4. Detect malware. On personally owned devices without restriction policies in place, users 
636 
may obtain applications outside official application stores, increasing the risk of installing 
637 
malware in disguise. To help protect from this risk, an organization could deploy 
638 
malware detection to devices to identify malicious applications and facilitate 
639 
remediation. 
640 
5. Trusted device access. Because mobile devices can connect from unknown locations, an 
641 
organization can provision mobile devices with a security certificate that allows 
642 
identifying and authenticating them at the connection point, which combines with user 
643 
credentials to create two-factor authentication from mobile devices. An employee would 
644 
not be able to access the organization’s resources without the required certificates. 
645 
6. Restrict information collection. Mobile device management tools can track application 
646 
inventory and location information, including physical address, geographic coordinates, 
647 
location history, internet protocol (IP) address, and Secure Set Identifier (SSID). These 
648 
capabilities may reveal sensitive information about employees, such as frequently visited 
649 
locations or habits. Device management tools can be configured to exclude application 
650 
and location information. Excluding the collection of information further protects 
651 
employee privacy when device and application data is shared outside the organization 
652 
for monitoring and analytics.  
653 
4.2 Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice 
654 
The example solution’s high-level goals underscore the need to use a thorough risk assessment process 
655 
for organizations implementing mobile device security capabilities. To learn more about how your 
656 
organization might implement this example solution, reference the Example Scenario: Putting Guidance 
657 
into Practice supplement of this practice guide. The supplement provides an example approach for 
658 
developing and deploying a BYOD architecture that directly addresses the mobile device threat events 
659 
and problematic data actions discussed in this guide.  
660 
The example scenario supplement shows how a fictional organization used the guidance in NIST’s 
661 
Cybersecurity Framework [1], Privacy Framework [2], Risk Management Framework [9], and PRAM [8] to 
662 
identify and address their BYOD security and privacy goals. 
663 
4.3 Technologies that Support the Security and Privacy Goals of the 
664 
Example Solution 
665 
This section describes the mobile-specific technology components used within this example solution. 
666 
These technologies were selected to address the security goals, threat events, and problematic data 
667 
actions identified in Section 4.1. This section provides a brief description of each technology and 
668 
discusses the security and privacy capabilities that each component provides.  
669 
The technology components in this section are combined into a cohesive enterprise architecture to help 
670 
address BYOD security threats and problematic data actions and provide security-enhanced access to 
671 
enterprise resources from mobile devices. The technologies described in this section provide protection 
672 
for enterprise resources accessed by BYOD users.

4.3.1 Trusted Execution Environment 
674 
A trusted execution environment (TEE) is “a tamper-resistant processing environment that runs on a 
675 
‘separation kernel’. It guarantees the authenticity of the executed code, the integrity of the runtime 
676 
states (e.g., central processing unit (CPU) registers, memory and sensitive I/O), and the confidentiality of 
677 
its code, data and runtime states stored on a persistent memory. In addition, it shall be able to provide 
678 
remote attestation that proves its trustworthiness for third-parties” [12]. The TEE helps protect the 
679 
mobile devices from executed code with integrity issues. This is important in BYOD environments due to 
680 
an enterprise’s limited control over an employee’s personally owned device. Users can install and run 
681 
many types of applications on personally owned devices without restriction from the enterprise. 
682 
4.3.2 Enterprise Mobility Management 
683 
Organizations use EMM solutions to secure the mobile devices of users who are authorized to access 
684 
organizational resources. Such solutions generally have two main components. The first is a backend 
685 
service that mobile administrators use to manage the policies, configurations, and security actions 
686 
applied to registered mobile devices. The second is an on-device agent, usually in the form of a mobile 
687 
application, that integrates between the mobile OS and the solution’s backend service. iOS also supports 
688 
a web-based EMM enrollment use case, which we do not discuss in this document. 
689 
At a minimum, an EMM solution can perform mobile device management (MDM) functions, which 
690 
include the ability to provision configuration profiles to devices, enforce security policies on devices, and 
691 
monitor compliance with those policies. The on-device MDM agent can typically notify the device user 
692 
of any noncompliant settings and may be able to remediate some noncompliant settings automatically. 
693 
The organization can use policy compliance data to inform its access control decisions so that it grants 
694 
access only to a device that demonstrates the mandated level of compliance with the security policies in 
695 
place. 
696 
EMM solutions commonly include any of the following capabilities: mobile application management, 
697 
mobile content management, and implementations of or integrations with device- or mobile-OS-specific 
698 
containerization solutions, such as Samsung Knox. These capabilities can be used in the following ways: 
699 
 
Mobile application management can be used to manage the installation and usage of 
700 
applications based on their trustworthiness and work relevance.  
701 
 
Mobile content management can control how managed applications access and use 
702 
organizational data.  
703 
 
Containerization solutions can strengthen the separation between a user’s personal and 
704 
professional usage of the device.  
705 
 
Also, EMM solutions often have integrations with a diverse set of additional tools and security 
706 
technologies that enhance their capabilities. 
707 
For further reading on this topic, NIST SP 800-124 Revision 2 (Draft), Guidelines for Managing the 
708 
Security of Mobile Devices in the Enterprise [6] provides additional information on mobile device 
709 
management with EMM solutions. The National Information Assurance Partnership’s (NIAP’s) Protection

Profile for Mobile Device Management Servers and Extended Package for Mobile Device Management 
711 
Agents [13] describes important capabilities and security requirements to look for in EMM systems. 
712 
EMMs can help BYOD deployments improve the security posture of the organization by providing a 
713 
baseline of controls to limit attack vectors and help protect enterprise information that is on a 
714 
personally owned device. EMMs can also provide an additional layer of separation between enterprise 
715 
data and personal data on a mobile device. 
716 
4.3.3 Virtual Private Network 
717 
A VPN gateway increases the security of remote connections from authorized mobile devices to an 
718 
organization’s internal network. A VPN is a virtual network, built on top of existing physical networks, 
719 
that can provide a secure communication channel for data and system control information transmitted 
720 
between networks. VPNs are used most often to protect communications carried over public networks 
721 
from eavesdropping and interception. A VPN can provide several types of data protection, including 
722 
confidentiality, integrity, authentication of data origin, replay protection, and access control that help 
723 
reduce the risks of transmitting data between network components. 
724 
VPN connections apply an additional layer of encryption to the communication between remote devices 
725 
and the internal network, and VPN gateways can enforce access control decisions by limiting what 
726 
devices or applications can connect to them. Integration with other security mechanisms allows a VPN 
727 
gateway to base access control decisions on more risk factors than it may be able to collect on its own; 
728 
examples include a device’s level of compliance with mobile security policies or the list of installed 
729 
applications as reported by an integrated EMM and/or MTD. 
730 
NIAP’s Module for Virtual Private Network (VPN) Gateways 1.0 [14], in combination with Protection 
731 
Profile for Network Devices [15], describes important capabilities and security requirements to expect 
732 
from VPN gateways. 
733 
In a BYOD deployment, an enterprise can also leverage a per-application VPN to provide a secure 
734 
connection over the VPN tunnel strictly when using enterprise applications on the mobile device. 
735 
Personal applications on the device would not be allowed to use the VPN, ensuring the enterprise has 
736 
visibility into enterprise traffic only. This is especially important to BYOD deployments, whose devices 
737 
may connect over a wide variety of wireless networks. It also provides a layer of privacy protection for 
738 
employees by preventing personal mobile device traffic from being routed through the enterprise. 
739 
4.3.4 Mobile Application Vetting Service 
740 
Mobile application vetting services use a variety of static, dynamic, and behavioral techniques to 
741 
determine if an application demonstrates any behaviors that pose a security or privacy risk. The risk may 
742 
be to a device owner or user, to parties that own data on the device, or to external systems to which the 
743 
application connects. The set of detected behaviors is often aggregated to generate a singular score that 
744 
estimates the level of risk (or conversely, trustworthiness) attributed to an application. Clients can often 
745 
adjust the values associated with given behaviors (e.g., hardcoded cryptographic keys) to tailor the score 
746 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
18 
for their unique risk posture. Those scores may be further aggregated to present a score that represents 
747 
the overall risk or trustworthiness posed by the set of applications currently installed on a given device. 
748 
Mobile applications, malicious or benign, can affect both security and user privacy negatively. A 
749 
malicious application can contain code intended to exploit vulnerabilities present in potentially any 
750 
targeted hardware, firmware, or software on the device. Alternatively, or in conjunction with exploit 
751 
code, a malicious application may misuse any device, personal, or behavioral data to which it has been 
752 
explicitly or implicitly granted access, such as contacts, clipboard data, or location services. Benign 
753 
applications may still present vulnerabilities or weaknesses that malicious applications can exploit to 
754 
gain unauthorized access to the device’s data or functionality. Further, benign applications may place 
755 
user privacy at risk by collecting more information than is necessary for it to deliver the functionality 
756 
desired by the user. 
757 
While not specific to applications, some services may include device-based risks (e.g., lack of disk 
758 
encryption or vulnerable OS version) in their analysis to provide a more comprehensive assessment of 
759 
the risk or trustworthiness presented by a device when running an application or service. 
760 
While NIAP does not provide a protection profile for application vetting services, their Protection Profile 
761 
for Application Software [16] describes security requirements to be expected from mobile applications. 
762 
Many mobile application vetting vendors provide capabilities to automate evaluation of applications 
763 
against NIAP’s requirements.  
764 
Application vetting services help improve the security and privacy posture of the mobile devices by as-
765 
sessing the risk of the applications that may be installed on a personally owned device. Depending on 
766 
the deployment strategy, the application vetting service may analyze all installed applications, enter-
767 
prise-only applications, or no applications. 
768 
4.3.5 Mobile Threat Defense 
769 
MTD generally takes the form of an application that is installed on the device that provides information 
770 
about the device’s threat posture based on risks, security, and activity on the device. This is also known 
771 
as endpoint protection. Ideally, the MTD solution will be able to detect unwanted activity and properly 
772 
inform the user and BYOD administrators so they can act to prevent or limit the harm that an attacker 
773 
could cause. Additionally, MTD solutions may integrate with EMM solutions to leverage the MTD agent’s 
774 
greater on-device management controls and enforcement capabilities, such as blocking a malicious 
775 
application from being launched until the user can remove it. 
776 
While detecting threats, MTD products typically analyze device-based threats, application-based threats, 
777 
and network-based threats. Device-based threats include outdated OS versions, nonsecure 
778 
configurations, elevation of privileges, unmanaged profiles, and compromised devices. Application-
779 
based threat detection can provide similar functionality to that of dedicated application vetting services. 
780 
However, application-based threat detection may not provide the same level of detail in its analysis as 
781 
dedicated application vetting services. Network-based threats include use of unencrypted and/or public 
782 
Wi-Fi networks and attacks such as active attempts to intercept and decrypt network traffic. 
783 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
19 
Because BYOD mobile phones can have a wide variety of installed applications and usage scenarios, 
784 
MTD helps improve the security and privacy posture by providing an agent-based capability to detect 
785 
unwanted activity. 
786 
4.3.6 Mobile Operating System Capabilities 
787 
Mobile OS capabilities are available without the use of additional security features. They are included as 
788 
part of the mobile device’s core capabilities. The following mobile OS capabilities can be found in mobile 
789 
devices, particularly mobile phones. 
790 
4.3.6.1 Secure Boot 
791 
Secure boot is a general term that refers to a system architecture that is designed to prevent and detect 
792 
any unauthorized modification to the boot process. A system that successfully completes a secure boot 
793 
has loaded its start-up sequence information into a trusted OS. A common mechanism is for the first 
794 
program executed (a boot loader) to be immutable (stored on read-only memory or implemented 
795 
strictly in hardware). Further, the integrity of mutable code is cryptographically verified by either 
796 
immutable or verified code prior to execution. This process establishes a chain of trust that can be 
797 
traced back to immutable, implicitly trustworthy code. Using an integrated TEE as part of a secure boot 
798 
process is preferable to an implementation that uses software alone [17]. 
799 
4.3.6.2 Device Attestation 
800 
This is an extension of the secure boot process that involves the OS (or more commonly, an integrated 
801 
TEE) providing cryptographically verifiable proof that it has a known and trusted identity and is in a 
802 
trustworthy state. This means that all software running on the device is free from unauthorized 
803 
modification. 
804 
Device attestation requires cryptographic operations using an immutable private key that can be verified 
805 
by a trusted third party, which is typically the original equipment manufacturer of the TEE or device 
806 
platform vendor. Proof of possession of a valid key establishes the integrity of the first link in a chain of 
807 
trust that preserves the integrity of all other pieces of data used in the attestation. It will include unique 
808 
device identifiers, metadata, the results of integrity checks on mutable software, and possibly metrics 
809 
from the boot or attestation process itself [17]. 
810 
4.3.6.3 Mobile Device Management Application Programming Interfaces 
811 
Mobile OS and platform-integrated firmware can provide a number of built-in security features that are 
812 
generally active by default. Examples include disk- and file-level encryption, verification of digital 
813 
signatures for installed software and updates, a device unlock code, remote device lock, and automatic 
814 
device wipe following a series of failed device unlock attempts. The user can directly configure some of 
815 
these features via a built-in application or through a service provided by the device platform vendor.  
816 
Additionally, mobile operating systems expose an application programming interface (API) to MDM 
817 
products that allow an organization that manages a device to have greater control over these and many 
818 
more settings that might not be directly accessible to the device user. Management APIs allow 
819 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
20 
enterprises using integrated EMM or MDM products to manage devices more effectively and efficiently 
820 
than they could by using the built-in application alone. 
821 
4.3.6.4 iOS App Transport Security 
822 
App Transport Security (ATS) is a networking security feature on Apple iOS devices that increases data 
823 
integrity and privacy for applications and extensions [18], [19]. ATS requires that the network 
824 
connections made by applications are secured through the Transport Layer Security protocol, which 
825 
uses reliable cipher suites and certificates. In addition, ATS blocks any connection that does not meet 
826 
minimum security requirements. For applications linked to iOS 9.0 and later, ATS is enabled by default. 
827 
Figure 4-2 shows how ATS compliant and noncompliant applications function. As demonstrated in the 
828 
figure, secured application requests are allowed, and nonsecure requests are blocked. 
829 
Figure 4-2 iOS App Transport Security 
830 
 
4.3.6.5 Android Network Security Configuration 
831 
With data privacy becoming even more important, Google released mobile OS enhancements to protect 
832 
data that traverses Android devices and endpoints [20], [21]. The Android Network Security 
833 
Configuration prevents applications from transmitting sensitive data unintentionally in unencrypted 
834 
cleartext. By default, cleartextTrafficPermitted is set to false. Through the Android Network 
835 
Security Configuration feature, developers can designate what certification authorities are trusted to 
836 
ensure secure communications and issue certificates.

4.4 Architecture Description 
838 
The example solution architecture consists of the security technologies described in Section 4.3. The 
839 
security technologies are further integrated with broader enterprise security mechanisms and a VPN 
840 
gateway as shown in Figure 4-3. This example solution provides a broad range of capabilities to securely 
841 
provision and manage devices, protect against and detect device compromise, and provide secure 
842 
access to enterprise resources to only authorized mobile users and devices. 
843 
Figure 4-3 Example Solution Architecture 
844 
 
The NCCoE worked with industry experts to develop an open, standards-based, architecture using 
845 
commercially-available products to address the threats and problematic data actions identified in 
846 
Section 4.1. 
847 
Where possible, the architecture uses components that are present on the NIAP Product Compliant List, 
848 
meaning that the product has been successfully evaluated against a NIAP-approved protection profile. 
849 
The NIAP collaborates with a broad community, including industry, government, and international 
850 
partners, to publish technology-specific security requirements and tests in the form of protection 
851 
profiles. The requirements and tests in these protection profiles are intended to ensure that evaluated 
852 
products address identified security threats and provide risk mitigation measures. 
853

The security and privacy characteristics of the architecture result from many of the capability 
854 
integrations outlined in Section 4.5. 
855 
4.5 Enterprise Integration of the Employees’ Personally Owned Mobile 
856 
Devices 
857 
One key benefit of BYOD solutions for employees is the ability to access both work and personal data on 
858 
the same device. While the technical approaches differ between iOS and Android devices, both 
859 
operating systems offer the following types of features for managing the coexistence of work and 
860 
personal data on devices [22], [23]:  
861 
 
data flow restriction between enterprise and personal applications 
862 
 
restriction of application installation from unknown sources 
863 
 
selective wiping to remove enterprise data and preserve personal data 
864 
 
device passcode requirement enforcement 
865 
 
application configuration control 
866 
 
identity and certificate authority certificate support

868 
integration for managed and unmanaged applications on iOS devices. To protect sensitive work data, 
869 
application restrictions, such as preventing the ability to copy data between work and personal 
870 
application, are applied.

873 
with data access restricted between the personal and work container applications.

4.5.1 Microsoft Active Directory Integration 
876 
The example solution is integrated with Microsoft Active Directory (AD), which provides both enterprise 
877 
identity management and certificate enrollment services via public key infrastructure. International 
878 
Business Machines (IBM) MaaS360 connects directly to the domain controller and the Network Device 
879 
Enrollment Service (NDES) servers via an IBM Cloud Extender installed on the local intranet, while 
880 
GlobalProtect connects to the domain controller via the Palo Alto Networks firewall’s Lightweight 
881 
Directory Access Protocol service route. 
882 
By integrating directly with the AD infrastructure, administrators can configure MaaS360 to accept 
883 
enrollment requests based on user groups in AD. GlobalProtect can inherit these roles and enforce 
884 
access control protocols to restrict/deny permissions to the VPN. The AD integration is also used within 
885 
MaaS360 to provide policy-based access to the MaaS360 administration console. 
886 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
25 
The Certificate Integration module within the MaaS360 Cloud Extender allows user certificates to be 
887 
installed on the user’s devices when enrolling with MaaS360. These certificates are then validated in 
888 
GlobalProtect during the VPN authentication sequence, along with the user’s corporate username and 
889 
password. The Cloud Extender requests these certificates from the NDES server by using the Simple 
890 
Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).  
891 
4.5.2 Mobile Device Enrollment 
892 
The example solution shown in Figure 4-6 mitigates the potential for SCEP to be remotely exploited by 
893 
restricting certificate enrollment to mobile devices that are connected to a dedicated enterprise-
894 
managed Wi-Fi network. The uniform resource locator (URL) of the NDES server is resolvable only on 
895 
this managed Wi-Fi network.  
896 
Furthermore, the NDES server is configured to require a dynamic challenge with each request. The Cloud 
897 
Extender does this by including a one-time password with each request. This helps prevent unknown 
898 
devices from requesting certificates. These certificates can then be used to prove identity when 
899 
authenticating with the GlobalProtect VPN. 
900 
The certificate template includes the user’s username and email address. This allows the GlobalProtect 
901 
gateway to enforce access control and identity verification.

904 
IBM MaaS360 supports integration of third-party applications and cloud services via a representational 
905 
state transfer (REST) API [24]. External services are authenticated via access tokens, obtained through 
906 
MaaS360 support. Zimperium and Kryptowire used the REST API [25].

4.6.1 Zimperium–MaaS360 
913 
Through the MaaS360 REST API, Zimperium can retrieve various device attributes, such as device name, 
914 
model, OS, OS version, and owner’s email address. It then continuously monitors the device’s risk 
915 
posture through the Zimperium Intrusion Prevention System (zIPS) application and reports any changes 
916 
in the posture to MaaS360. This enables MaaS360 administrators to apply different device policies and 
917 
enforcement actions based on the risk posture of a device. 
918 
When a device is enrolled with MaaS360, the zIPS application is automatically installed and configured 
919 
on the device. When the user first launches the zIPS application, it will automatically enroll the device in 
920 
Zimperium’s MTD service. zIPS will then continuously monitor the device for threats, and any detected 
921 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
28 
threats will be reported to Zimperium. Zimperium can then report to MaaS360 if any changes in risk 
922 
posture occurred. 
923 
MaaS360 can respond to the following risk posture levels, as assigned by Zimperium: 
924 
 
low 
925 
 
normal 
926 
 
elevated 
927 
 
critical 
928 
4.6.2 Kryptowire–MaaS360 
929 
Through the MaaS360 REST API, Kryptowire can retrieve a list of enrolled devices, device metadata, and 
930 
the inventory of applications installed on those devices. This allows Kryptowire to automatically analyze 
931 
all new applications installed on enrolled devices, ensuring that the risk posture of the devices, and 
932 
therefore the enterprise, stays at an acceptable level. 
933 
Kryptowire also has configurable threat scores for various factors, such as requested permissions and 
934 
hardcoded encryption keys. 
935 
The threat scores can be configured to one of four levels: 
936 
 
low 
937 
 
medium 
938 
 
high 
939 
 
critical 
940 
The administrator can configure a threat score alert threshold and an email address to receive alerts 
941 
when an application’s threat score is at or above the threshold. The administrator can then take 
942 
appropriate action on the device in MaaS360. 
943 
Further, Kryptowire can provide information about applications including the latest version, when it was 
944 
last seen, when tracking began, and the number of versions that have been seen. 
945 
4.6.3 Palo Alto Networks–MaaS360 
946 
Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect VPN secures remote connections from mobile devices. MaaS360 
947 
offers specific configuration options for the GlobalProtect client, using certificate-based authentication 
948 
to the GlobalProtect gateway and available for Android and iOS, that facilitate deployment of VPN 
949 
clients and enabled VPN access. Section 4.5 presents details of the certificate enrollment process. 
950 
Two components of the Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall compose the VPN architecture used 
951 
in this example solution–a GlobalProtect portal and a GlobalProtect gateway. The portal provides the 
952 
management functions for the VPN infrastructure. Every endpoint that participates in the GlobalProtect 
953 
network receives configuration information from the portal, including information about available 
954 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
29 
gateways as well as any client certificates that may be required to connect to the GlobalProtect 
955 
gateway(s). A GlobalProtect gateway provides security enforcement for network traffic. The 
956 
GlobalProtect gateway in this example solution is configured to provide mobile device users with access 
957 
to specific enterprise resources from the secure contexts after a successful authentication and 
958 
authorization decision. 
959 
The VPN tunnel negotiation between the VPN endpoint/mobile device context and the VPN gateway has 
960 
four steps: (1) The portal provides the client configuration, (2) a user logs into the system, (3) the agent 
961 
automatically connects to the gateway and establishes a VPN tunnel, and (4) the security policy on the 
962 
gateway enables access to internal and external applications. 
963 
For this example solution, a per-application VPN configuration is enforced on iOS and an always-on work 
964 
container VPN configuration on Android. This configuration forces the device to automatically establish 
965 
a VPN connection to the GlobalProtect gateway whenever an application in the predefined list of 
966 
applications runs on the device or when an application in the work container is launched. 
967 
4.6.4 iOS and Android MDM Integration 
968 
Both iOS and Android integrate directly with MaaS360. Configuration profiles manage iOS devices. 
969 
Configuration profiles can force security policies such as VPN usage, ActiveSync support, access to cloud 
970 
services, application compliance, passcode policy, device restrictions, and Wi-Fi settings. 
971 
Android devices are managed by Android Enterprise, which provides controls for both the device itself 
972 
and the work container. The work container is a special folder on the phone that stores all the 
973 
enterprise applications and data, ensuring separation from personal applications and data. This is 
974 
implemented as a profile owner solution, as opposed to Corporate-Owned Personally-Enabled (COPE), 
975 
which is implemented as a device owner solution.  
976 
4.7 Privacy Settings: Mobile Device Data Processing 
977 
This section takes a look at components within the example architecture and the type of information an 
978 
enterprise may access from an employee’s personal mobile device through those components. 
979 
Understanding the type of data an enterprise has access to can be helpful when understanding any 
980 
privacy implications. 
981 
4.7.1 EMM: MaaS360 
982 
When a personal mobile phone is connected to an EMM system, some data is collected and visible to 
983 
the enterprise. While additional data can be collected, our example solution collects only the data 
984 
shown in Figure 4-7 to help protect employee privacy. This information is provided by MaaS360 to 
985 
Kryptowire’s application vetting capability. Kryptowire then uses the MaaS360 supplied information to 
986 
determine application security characteristics. IBM provides documentation with more details on the 
987 
information that MaaS360 collects and processes [26].

As shown in Figure 4-8, administrators can restrict collection of location and/or application inventory 
990 
information. When an administrator restricts location collection, the administrator cannot see any 
991 
location information about devices. Similarly, when an administrator restricts application inventory 
992 
information, MaaS360 will not collect applications that are not distributed through the enterprise and 
993 
therefore, will not transmit them to third-party application-vetting services. Both privacy controls can be 
994 
applied to specific device groups—for example, COPE devices could have their location information 
995 
collected—but location collection can be disabled for personal devices.

5 Security and Privacy Analysis 
1054 
This section familiarizes the reader with: 
1055 
 
the example solution’s assumptions and limitations 
1056 
 
results of the example solution’s laboratory testing  
1057 
 
scenarios and findings that show the security and privacy characteristics addressed by the 
1058 
reference design 
1059 
 
the security and privacy control capabilities of the example solution 
1060 
The purpose of the security and privacy characteristics evaluation is to understand the extent to which 
1061 
the project meets its objectives of demonstrating capabilities for securing mobile devices within an 
1062 
enterprise by deploying EMM, MTD, application vetting, secure boot/image authentication, and VPN 
1063 
services while also protecting the privacy of employees participating in the BYOD implementation. 
1064 
5.1 Analysis Assumptions and Limitations 
1065 
The security and privacy characteristics analysis has the following limitations: 
1066 
 
It is neither a comprehensive test of all security and privacy components nor a red-team 
1067 
exercise. 
1068 
 
It does not identify all weaknesses. 
1069 
 
It does not include the lab infrastructure. It is assumed that devices are hardened. Testing these 
1070 
devices would reveal only weaknesses in implementation that would not be relevant to those 
1071 
adopting this reference architecture.  
1072 
5.2 Build Testing 
1073 
Test activities are provided to show how the example architecture addresses each threat event and 
1074 
problematic data action. The NIST SP 1800-22 Supplement, Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into 
1075 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
35 
Practice, provides insights into how an organization may determine its susceptibility to the threat before 
1076 
implementing the architecture detailed in this practice guide. The test activities contained in Appendix E, 
1077 
Build Testing Details, demonstrate to the reader how Great Seneca validated their desired outcomes for 
1078 
the identified threat events and problematic data actions. Appendix F, Threat Event Test Information, 
1079 
shows examples of test results for this build. 
1080 
5.3 Scenarios and Findings 
1081 
One aspect of the security evaluation involved assessing how well the reference design addresses the 
1082 
security characteristics that it was intended to support. The Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories 
1083 
were used to provide structure to the security assessment by consulting the specific sections of each 
1084 
standard that are cited in reference to a Subcategory. Using the Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories 
1085 
as a basis for organizing the analysis, allowed systematic consideration of how well the reference design 
1086 
supports the intended security characteristics.  
1087 
This section of the publication provides findings for the security and privacy characteristics that the ex-
1088 
ample solution was intended to support. These topics are described in the following subsections:  
1089 
 
development of the Cybersecurity Framework and NICE Framework mappings 
1090 
 
threat events related to security and example solution architecture mitigations  
1091 
 
problematic data actions related to privacy and potential mitigations that organizations could 
1092 
employ 
1093 
An example scenario that demonstrates how an organization may use NIST SP 1800-22 and other NIST 
1094 
tools to implement a BYOD use case is discussed more in the NIST SP 1800-22 Supplement, Example 
1095 
Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice of this practice guide. 
1096 
5.3.1 Cybersecurity Framework and NICE Framework Work Roles Mappings 
1097 
As we installed, configured, and used the products in the architecture, we determined and documented 
1098 
the example solution’s functions and their corresponding Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories, along 
1099 
with other guidance alignment. 
1100 
This mapping will help users of this practice guide communicate with their organization’s stakeholders 
1101 
regarding the security controls that the practice guide recommends for helping mitigate BYOD threats, 
1102 
and the workforce capabilities that the example solution will require. 
1103 
The products, frameworks, security controls, and workforce mappings are in Appendix G. 
1104 
5.3.2 Threat Events and Findings 
1105 
As part of the findings, the threat events were mitigated in the example solution architecture using the 
1106 
concepts and technology shown in Table 5-1. Each threat event was matched with functions that helped 
1107 
mitigate the risks posed by the threat event.

5.3.3 Privacy Problematic Data Actions and Findings 
1113 
The privacy risk analysis found that three data actions in the build were potentially problematic data 
1114 
actions for individuals. We identified potential technical mitigations that an organization could use to 
1115 
lessen their impact, as shown below in Table 5-2. Organizations may also need to supplement these 
1116 
technical mitigations with supporting policies and procedures.

1120 
privacy control maps were developed to show these in a standardized methodology. 
1121 
The control maps show the security and privacy characteristics for the products used in the example 
1122 
solution.

6 Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice  
1125 
To demonstrate how an organization may use NIST SP 1800-22 and other NIST tools to implement a 
1126 
BYOD use case, the NCCoE created the Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice supplement for 
1127 
this practice guide.  
1128 
This example scenario shows how a fictional, small-to-mid-size organization (Great Seneca Accounting) 
1129 
can successfully navigate common enterprise BYOD security challenges.  
1130 
In the narrative example, Great Seneca Accounting completes a security risk assessment by using the 
1131 
guidance in NIST SP 800-30 [27] and the Mobile Threat Catalogue [5] to identify cybersecurity threats to 
1132 
the organization. The company then uses the NIST PRAM [8] to perform a privacy risk assessment. 
1133 
Appendix F and Appendix G of the Supplement describe these risk assessments in more detail. These risk 
1134 
assessments produce two significant conclusions: 
1135 
1. Great Seneca Accounting finds similar cybersecurity threats in its environment and problematic 
1136 
data actions for employee privacy as those discussed in NIST SP 1800-22, validating that the 
1137 
controls discussed in the example solution are relevant to their environment.  
1138 
2. The organization determines that it has a high-impact system, based on the impact guidance in 
1139 
NIST FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems 
1140 
[28], and needs to implement more controls beyond those identified in NIST SP 1800-22 to 
1141 
support the additional system components in its own solution (e.g., underlying OS, the data 
1142 
center where the equipment will reside).  
1143 
As part of their review of NIST FIPS 200, Great Seneca Accounting selects security and privacy controls 
1144 
from NIST SP 800-53 [29] for their BYOD architecture implementation. They then tailor the control 
1145 
baselines based on the needs identified through the priority Subcategories in its cybersecurity and 
1146 
privacy Target Profiles.  
1147 
A detailed description of the implementation process that the fictional organization Great Seneca 
1148 
Accounting followed is provided in the NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into 
1149 
Practice supplement of this practice guide. 
1150 
7 Conclusion 
1151 
This practice guide provides an explanation of mobile device security and privacy concepts and an 
1152 
example solution for organizations implementing a BYOD deployment. As shown in Figure 7-1, this 
1153 
example solution applied multiple mobile device security technologies. These included a cloud-based 
1154 
EMM solution integrated with cloud- and agent-based mobile security technologies to help deploy a set 
1155 
of security and privacy capabilities that support the example solution. 
1156

Figure 7-1 Example Solution Architecture 
1157 
 
 
Our fictional Great Seneca Accounting organization example scenario contained in the Example 
1158 
Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice supplement of this practice guide illustrates how the concepts 
1159 
and architecture from this guide may be applied by an organization. Great Seneca started with an 
1160 
information technology infrastructure that lacked mobile device security architecture concepts. Great 
1161 
Seneca then employed multiple NIST cybersecurity and privacy risk management tools to understand 
1162 
the gaps in its architecture and the methods available today to enhance the security and privacy of its 
1163 
BYOD deployment. 
1164 
This practice guide also includes in Volume C a series of how-to guides—step-by-step instructions 
1165 
covering the initial setup (installation or provisioning) and configuration for each component of the 
1166 
architecture—to help security engineers rapidly deploy and evaluate our example solution in their test 
1167 
environment. 
1168 
The example solution uses standards-based, commercially available products that can be used by an 
1169 
organization interested in deploying a BYOD solution. The example solution provides recommendations 
1170 
for enhancing the security and privacy infrastructure by integrating on-premises and cloud-hosted 
1171 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
41 
mobile security technologies. This practice guide provides an example solution that an organization may 
1172 
use in whole or in part as the basis for creating a custom solution that best supports their unique needs. 
1173 
8 Future Build Considerations 
1174 
For a future build, the team is considering a virtual mobile infrastructure (VMI) or unified endpoint 
1175 
management (UEM) solution.  
1176 
The VMI deployment could include installing an application on a device at enrollment time, which would 
1177 
grant access to a virtual phone contained within the corporate infrastructure. The virtual phone would 
1178 
then contain the corporate-supplied applications that an employee would require for performing 
1179 
standard mobile work tasks. The thin client deployment limits the storage of organizational data on the 
1180 
device and helps ensure that access to the organization’s data uses security-enhancing capabilities. 
1181 
UEM would entail managing a user’s mobile device ecosystem, potentially including laptops, mobile 
1182 
phones, and IoT devices (e.g., smart watches and Bluetooth headsets).

Access 
Management 
Access Management is the set of practices that enables only those permitted the 
ability to perform an action on a particular resource. The three most common Access 
Management services you encounter every day perhaps without realizing it are: 
Policy Administration, Authentication, and Authorization [30]. 
Availability 
Ensure that users can access resources through remote access whenever needed 
[31]. 
Bring Your 
Own Device 
(BYOD) 
A non-organization-controlled telework client device [31]. 
Confidentiality Ensure that remote access communications and stored user data cannot be read by 
unauthorized parties [31]. 
Data Actions 
System operations that process PII [32]. 
Disassociability Enabling the processing of PII or events without association to individuals or devices 
beyond the operational requirements of the system [32]. 
Eavesdropping An attack in which an Attacker listens passively to the authentication protocol to 
capture information which can be used in a subsequent active attack to masquerade 
as the Claimant [33] (definition located under eavesdropping attack). 
Firewall 
Firewalls are devices or programs that control the flow of network traffic between 
networks or hosts that employ differing security postures [34]. 
Integrity 
Detect any intentional or unintentional changes to remote access communications 
that occur in transit [31]. 
Manageability Providing the capability for granular administration of PII including alteration, 
deletion, and selective disclosure [32]. 
Mobile Device A portable computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily 
be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical 
connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, 
non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power 
source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board 
sensors that allow the devices to capture information, and/or built-in features for 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
45 
synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, 
tablets, and E-readers [29]. 
Personally 
Identifiable 
Information 
(PII) 
Any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including any 
information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as 
name, Social Security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or 
biometric records; and any other information that is linked or linkable to an 
individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information [35] 
(adapted from Government Accountability Office Report 08-536). 
 
Predictability 
Enabling of reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about PII and 
its processing by a system [32]. 
Privacy Event 
The occurrence or potential occurrence of problematic data actions [2]. 
Problematic 
Data Action 
A data action that could cause an adverse effect for individuals [2]. 
Threat 
Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational 
operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, 
individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via 
unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or 
denial of service [27]. 
Vulnerability 
Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or 
implementation that could be exploited by a threat source [27].

Appendix E 
Example Solution Lab Build Testing Details 
1432 
This section shows the test activities performed to demonstrate how this practice guide’s example 
1433 
solution that was built in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National 
1434 
Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) lab addresses the threat events and problematic data 
1435 
actions defined from the risk assessment. 
1436 
E.1 Threat Event 1 
1437 
Summary: Unauthorized access to sensitive information via a malicious or privacy-intrusive application 
1438 
is tested. 
1439 
Test Activity: Place mock sensitive enterprise contact list and calendar entries on devices, then attempt 
1440 
to install and use applications that access and back up those entries. 
1441 
Desired Outcome: The enterprise’s security architecture would either detect or prevent use of these 
1442 
applications, or it would block the applications from accessing enterprise-controlled contact list and 
1443 
calendar entries. The enterprise’s security architecture should identify presence of the applications and 
1444 
the fact that they access contact and calendar entries. The security architecture should block these 
1445 
applications from installing, block them from running, or detect their presence and cause another 
1446 
appropriate response, such as blocking the mobile device from accessing enterprise resources until the 
1447 
applications are removed. 
1448 
Alternatively, built-in device mechanisms such as Apple’s managed applications functionality and 
1449 
Google’s Android enterprise work profile functionality could be used to separate the contact and 
1450 
calendar entries associated with enterprise email accounts so that they can only be accessed by 
1451 
enterprise applications (applications that the enterprise mobility management (EMM) authorizes and 
1452 
manages), not by applications manually installed by the user. The user should not be able to manually 
1453 
provision their enterprise email account. Only the EMM should be able to provision the account, 
1454 
enabling enterprise controls on the enterprise contact list and calendar data. 
1455 
Observed Outcome: Once MaaS360 was aware that an application had access to sensitive data (e.g., 
1456 
calendar entries, contacts), it applied a policy to the device and took appropriate actions automatically. 
1457 
MaaS360 sent an alert to the mobile device about an application compliance policy violation and 
1458 
requested that the user remove the application(s) within an administrator-set time frame. In our test, 
1459 
the simulated user account did not remove the restricted applications within the predefined time frame, 
1460 
and MaaS360 removed mobile device management (MDM) control from the mobile device. 
1461 
E.2 Threat Event 2 
1462 
Summary: A fictional phishing event was created to test protection against the theft of credentials 
1463 
through a short message service (SMS) or email phishing campaign. 
1464 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
55 
Test Activity:  
1465 
 
This threat event can be tested by establishing a web page with a form that impersonates an 
1466 
enterprise login prompt. 
1467 
 
Then send the web page’s uniform resource locator (URL) via SMS or email and attempt to 
1468 
collect and use enterprise login credentials. 
1469 
Desired Outcome: The enterprise’s security architecture should block the user from browsing to known 
1470 
malicious websites. Additionally, the enterprise should use multifactor authentication or phishing-
1471 
resistant authentication methods such as those based on public key cryptography so that either there is 
1472 
no password for a malicious actor to capture or capturing the password is insufficient to obtain access to 
1473 
enterprise resources. 
1474 
Observed Outcome: The example solution used Palo Alto Networks’ next-generation firewall. The 
1475 
firewall includes PAN-DB, a URL filtering service that automatically blocks known malicious URLs. The 
1476 
URL filtering database is updated regularly to help protect users from malicious URLs. The next-
1477 
generation firewall blocked the attempt to visit the phishing site. However, if the malicious URL were 
1478 
not present in PAN-DB, the user would be allowed to access the website. 
1479 
E.3 Threat Event 3 
1480 
Summary: Testing to discover for unauthorized applications that are not present on the official Apple 
1481 
App Store or Google Play Store, that can be installed via URL links in SMS, email messages, or third-party 
1482 
websites. 
1483 
Test Activity (Android): 
1484 
 
Send an email to the user with a message urging the user to click the link to install the 
1485 
application. 
1486 
 
On the device, if not already enabled, attempt to enable the Unknown Sources toggle setting in 
1487 
the device security settings to allow installing applications from sources other than the Google 
1488 
Play Store. 
1489 
 
On the device, read the received email, click the link, and attempt to install the application. 
1490 
 
Observe whether the application could be successfully installed. If so, observe whether the 
1491 
enterprise detected and responded to installation of the unauthorized application. 
1492 
Test Activity (iOS): 
1493 
 
Send an email to the user with a message urging the user to click the link to install the 
1494 
application.  
1495 
 
On the device, read the received email, click the link, and attempt to install the application. 
1496 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
56 
Desired Outcome: Zimperium should alert both the administrators and user of the presence of a side-
1497 
loaded application. 
1498 
Observed Outcome: Zimperium alerted both the user and MaaS360 about the presence of a side-loaded 
1499 
application. MaaS360 sent an email notification to the user and administrator about the presence of 
1500 
side-loaded applications and required actions. 
1501 
E.4 Threat Event 4 
1502 
Summary: Confidentiality and integrity loss due to exploitation of known vulnerability in the operating 
1503 
system or firmware. 
1504 
Test Activity: Attempt to access enterprise resources from a mobile device with known vulnerabilities 
1505 
(e.g., running an older, unpatched version of iOS or Android). 
1506 
Desired Outcome: The enterprise’s security architecture should identify the presence of devices that are 
1507 
running an outdated version of iOS or Android susceptible to known vulnerabilities. It should be 
1508 
possible, when warranted by the risks, to block devices from accessing enterprise resources until system 
1509 
updates are installed. 
1510 
Observed Outcome: Zimperium was able to identify devices that were running an outdated version of 
1511 
iOS or Android, and it informed MaaS360 when a device was out of compliance. 
1512 
E.5 Threat Event 5 
1513 
Summary: This threat event test shows collection of location, camera, or microphone data by an 
1514 
application that has no need to access this data.  
1515 
Note: Not all applications that have access to location, camera, or microphone data are malicious. 
1516 
However, when applications are found collecting this information, additional vetting or testing may be 
1517 
required to determine the intent of its use and then to determine if the application is malicious.  
1518 
Test Activity: Upload the application to Kryptowire; observe the output report. 
1519 
Desired Outcome: Output report identifies the use of location, camera, or microphone by the 
1520 
application. 
1521 
Observed Outcome: The Kryptowire report identified the usage of privacy-intrusive permissions when 
1522 
not required.  
1523 
E.6 Threat Event 6 
1524 
Summary: Loss of confidentiality of sensitive information via eavesdropping on unencrypted device 
1525 
communications. 
1526 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
57 
Test Activity: Test if applications will attempt to establish a hypertext transfer protocol or unencrypted 
1527 
connection. 
1528 
Desired Outcome:  
1529 
 
Android: Because all work applications are inside a work container, a container-wide virtual 
1530 
private network (VPN) policy can be applied to mitigate this threat event; all communications, 
1531 
both encrypted and unencrypted, will be sent through the VPN tunnel. This will prevent 
1532 
eavesdropping on any communication originating from a work application. 
1533 
 
iOS: Apply a per-application VPN policy that will send all data transmitted by managed 
1534 
applications through the VPN tunnel. This will prevent eavesdropping on any unencrypted 
1535 
communication originating from work applications. 
1536 
 
Kryptowire can identify if an application attempts to establish an unencrypted connection. 
1537 
Observed Outcome: The Kryptowire report indicated that the application did not use in-transit data 
1538 
encryption. 
1539 
E.7 Threat Event 7 
1540 
Summary: Compromise of device integrity via observed, inferred, or brute-forced device unlock code. 
1541 
Test Activity: 
1542 
 
Attempt to completely remove the device unlock code. Observe whether the attempt succeeds. 
1543 
 
Attempt to set the device unlock code to “1234,” a weak four-digit personal identification 
1544 
number (PIN). Observe whether the attempt succeeds. 
1545 
 
Attempt to continually unlock the device, confirming that the device is factory reset after 10 
1546 
failed attempts. 
1547 
Desired Outcome: Policies set on the device by the EMM (MaaS360) should require a device unlock 
1548 
code to be set, prevent the device unlock code from being removed, require a minimum complexity for 
1549 
the device unlock code, and factory resetting the device after 10 failed unlock attempts. 
1550 
Additionally, Zimperium can identify and report devices with a disabled lock screen. 
1551 
Observed Outcome: MaaS360 applies a policy to the devices to enforce a mandatory PIN and device-
1552 
wide capability. Zimperium reports devices with a disabled lock screen. 
1553 
E.8 Threat Event 8 
1554 
Summary: Unauthorized access to backend services via authentication or credential storage 
1555 
vulnerabilities in internally developed applications. 
1556 
Test Activity: Application was submitted to Kryptowire for analysis of credential weaknesses. 
1557 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
58 
Desired Outcome: Discover and report credential weaknesses.  
1558 
Observed Outcome: Kryptowire recognized within an application that the application uses hardcoded 
1559 
credentials. The application’s use of hardcoded credentials could introduce vulnerabilities if 
1560 
unauthorized entities used the hardcoded credentials to access enterprise resources. 
1561 
E.9 
Threat Event 9 
1562 
Summary: Unauthorized access of enterprise resources from an unmanaged and potentially 
1563 
compromised device. 
1564 
Test Activity: Attempt to directly access enterprise services, e.g., Exchange email server or corporate 
1565 
VPN, on a mobile device that is not enrolled in the EMM system. 
1566 
Desired Outcome: Enterprise services should not be accessible from devices that are not enrolled in the 
1567 
EMM system. Otherwise, the enterprise is not able to effectively manage devices to prevent threats. 
1568 
Observed Outcome: Devices that were not enrolled in MaaS360 were unable to access enterprise 
1569 
resources as the GlobalProtect VPN gateway prevented the devices from authenticating without proper 
1570 
client certificates—obtainable only through enrolling in the EMM. 
1571 
E.10 
Threat Event 10 
1572 
Summary: Loss of organizational data due to a lost or stolen device. 
1573 
Test Activity: Attempt to download enterprise data onto a mobile device that is not enrolled in the 
1574 
EMM system (may be performed in conjunction with TE-9). Attempt to remove (in conjunction with TE-
1575 
7) the screen lock passcode or demonstrate that the device does not have a screen lock passcode in 
1576 
place. Attempt to locate and selectively wipe the device through the EMM console (will fail if the device 
1577 
is not enrolled in the EMM). 
1578 
Desired Outcome: It should be possible to locate or wipe EMM enrolled devices in response to a report 
1579 
that they have been lost or stolen. As demonstrated by TE-9, only EMM enrolled devices should be able 
1580 
to access enterprise resources. As demonstrated by TE-7, EMM enrolled devices can be forced to have a 
1581 
screen lock with a passcode of appropriate strength, which helps resist exploitation (including loss of 
1582 
organizational data) if the device has been lost or stolen. 
1583 
Observed Outcome (Enrolled Devices): Enrolled devices are protected. They have an enterprise policy 
1584 
requiring a PIN/lock screen, and therefore, the enterprise data on the device could not be accessed. 
1585 
After 10 attempts to access the device, the device was selectively wiped, removing all enterprise data. 
1586 
Additionally, the device could be remotely wiped after it was reported as lost to enterprise mobile 
1587 
device service management, ensuring no corporate data is left in the hands of attackers. 
1588 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
59 
Observed Outcome (Unenrolled Devices): As shown in Threat Event 9, only enrolled devices could 
1589 
access enterprise services. When the device attempted to access enterprise data, no connection to the 
1590 
enterprise services was available. Because the device cannot access the enterprise, the device would not 
1591 
contain enterprise information.  
1592 
In both outcomes, both enrolled and unenrolled, it would be at the user’s discretion if they wanted to 
1593 
wipe all personal data as well. Because this is a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenario, only corporate 
1594 
data (managed applications on iOS, and the work container on Android) would be deleted from a device 
1595 
if the device were lost or stolen. 
1596 
E.11 
Threat Event 11 
1597 
Summary: Loss of confidentiality of organizational data due to its unauthorized storage in non-
1598 
organizationally managed services. 
1599 
Test Activity: Connect to the enterprise VPN. Open an enterprise website or application. Attempt to 
1600 
extract enterprise data by taking a screenshot, or copy/paste and send it via an unmanaged email 
1601 
account. 
1602 
Desired Outcome: The EMM will prohibit screenshots and other data-sharing actions while using 
1603 
managed applications. 
1604 
Observed Outcome: Through MaaS360 device policies, an administrator could prevent the following 
1605 
actions on BYODs: 
1606

Threat Event 12 
1629 
Summary: Unauthorized access to work applications via bypassed lock screen (e.g., sharing the device’s 
1630 
PIN with family members). 
1631 
Test Activity: Assume the user is an unauthorized person attempting to access enterprise resources. 
1632 
Unlock the device and attempt to open a work application. 
1633 
Desired Outcome: The user will be prompted to log in to the VPN using their corporate username and 
1634 
password. Because the user does not know this password, they are unable to log in and access 
1635 
corporate resources. However, if the user attempts to access a work application within the idle log-out 
1636 
time, they will be granted access because no password will be requested. 
1637 
Observed Outcome: GlobalProtect prompted the unauthorized user for a password. Not knowing the 
1638 
password, the unauthorized user was unable to access corporate resources. 
1639 
E.13 
Problematic Data Action 1 
1640 
Summary: The user retains personal data and applications while access to corporate applications and 
1641 
data is removed. 
1642 
Test Activity: Selectively wipe a device using MaaS360. 
1643 
Desired Outcome: The user will no longer be able to access work applications and data on the device 
1644 
and retains all access to their personal applications and data. 
1645 
Observed Outcome: Corporate data and applications are removed while personal data is untouched. 
1646 
E.14 
Problematic Data Action 2 
1647 
Summary: Collection of application and location data is restricted. 
1648 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
61 
Test Activity: Disable location and application inventory collection in MaaS360. 
1649 
Desired Outcome: The MDM does not collect an inventory of applications on the device and does not 
1650 
collect location information, including physical address, geographic coordinates and history, internet 
1651 
protocol (IP) address, and secure set identifier (SSID). 
1652 
Observed Outcome: When inspecting a device, location and application inventory information are not 
1653 
shown to the user, and application inventory information is not transmitted to Kryptowire. 
1654 
E.15 
Problematic Data Action 3 
1655 
Summary: Access to monitoring data from the device is restricted to administrators. Application and 
1656 
location data are not shared with third parties that support monitoring, data analytics, and other 
1657 
functions for operating the BYOD solution. 
1658 
Test Activity: Attempt to log in to the MaaS360 admin portal without domain administrator permissions. 
1659 
Desired Outcome: System provides access controls to monitoring functions and logs. Data flow between 
1660 
the organization and third parties does not contain location information, including physical address, 
1661 
geographic coordinates and history, IP address, and SSID. 
1662 
Observed Outcome: Domain administrators were allowed to log in, but non-administrator users were 
1663 
not.

Table G-1’s example security control map identifies the security characteristic standards mapping for the products as they were 
1760 
used in the example solution. The products may have additional capabilities that we did not use in this example solution. For 
1761 
that reason, it is recommended that the mapping not be used as a reference for all of the security capabilities these products 
1762 
may be able to address.

Appendix H 
Example Privacy Subcategory and Control Map 
1765 
Using the developed privacy information as input, we identified the privacy characteristics of the example solution. We 
1766 
developed a privacy control map documenting the example solution’s capabilities with applicable Functions, Categories, and 
1767 
Subcategories from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Privacy Framework [2]; and NIST SP 800-53 
1768 
Revision 5 [38]; and NIST SP 800-181, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework 
1769 
(Work Roles from 2017 version) [3]. 
1770 
The table that follows maps component functions in the build to the related Subcategories in the NIST Privacy Framework as 
1771 
well as to controls in the NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5 controls catalog. Each column maps independently to the build component’s 
1772 
functions and, given the specific capabilities of this mobile device security solution, may differ from other NIST-provided 
1773 
mappings for the Privacy Framework and SP 800-53 revision. For example, build functions may provide additional capabilities 
1774 
beyond what is contemplated by a Privacy Framework Subcategory or that are implemented by additional controls beyond those 
1775 
that NIST identified as an informative reference for the Subcategory. 
1776 
Table H-1’s example privacy control map identifies the privacy characteristic mapping for the products as they were used in the 
1777 
example solution. The products may have additional capabilities that we did not use in this example solution. For that reason, it 
1778 
is recommended that the mapping not be used as a reference for all of the privacy capabilities these products may be able to 
1779 
address. The comprehensive mapping of the NIST Privacy Framework to NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5 controls can be found on the 
1780 
NIST Privacy Framework Resource Repository website, in the event an organization’s mobile device security solution is different 
1781 
to determine other controls that are appropriate for their environment [62].

1 Applying This Build: Example Scenario 
1 
An example scenario about a fictional company named Great Seneca Accounting illustrates how 
2 
organizations can use this practice guide’s example solution. The example shows how Bring Your Own 
3 
Device (BYOD) objectives can align with a fictional organization’s security and privacy priorities through 
4 
the use of risk management standards, guidance, and tools.  
5 
To demonstrate how an organization may use this National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
6 
Special Publication (SP) and other NIST tools to implement a BYOD use case, the National Cybersecurity 
7 
Center of Excellence created an example scenario that centers around a fictional, small-to-mid-size 
8 
organization called Great Seneca Accounting. This scenario exemplifies the issues that an organization 
9 
may face when addressing common enterprise BYOD security challenges.  
10 
1.1 Standards and Guidance Used in this Example Scenario 
11 
In addition to the Executive Summary contained in Volume A, and the architecture description in 
12 
Volume B, this practice guide also includes a series of how-to instructions in Volume C. The how-to 
13 
instructions in Volume C provide step-by-step instructions covering the initial setup (installation or 
14 
provisioning) and configuration for each component of the architecture. These step-by-step instructions 
15 
can help security engineers rapidly deploy and evaluate the example solution in their test environment. 
16 
The example solution uses standards-based, commercially available products that can be used by an 
17 
organization interested in deploying a BYOD solution. The example solution provides recommendations 
18 
for enhancing the security and privacy infrastructure by integrating on-premises and cloud-hosted 
19 
mobile security technologies. This practice guide provides an example solution that an organization may 
20 
use in whole or in part as the basis for creating a custom solution that best supports their unique needs. 
21 
The fictional Great Seneca Accounting organization illustrates how this guide may be applied by an 
22 
organization, starting with a mobile device infrastructure that lacked mobile device security architecture 
23 
concepts. Great Seneca employed multiple NIST cybersecurity and privacy risk management tools to 
24 
understand the gaps in its architecture and methods to enhance security of its systems and privacy for 
25 
its employees. 
26 
This example scenario provides useful context for using the following NIST Frameworks and other 
27 
relevant tools to help mitigate some of the security and privacy challenges that organizations may 
28 
encounter when deploying BYOD capabilities: 
29 
• 
NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.1 (Cybersecurity 
30 
Framework) [1] 
31 
•

32

2 About Great Seneca Accounting 
39 
In the example scenario, Great Seneca Accounting is a fictional accounting firm that grew from a single 
40 
office location into a larger firm with a regional presence. Great Seneca Accounting performs accounting 
41 
functions related to capturing, communicating, processing, transmitting, and analyzing financial data 
42 
and accounting services for its customers.  
43 
When the firm was first created, most of its employees worked from the Great Seneca Accounting 
44 
office, with minimal use of mobile devices. They were able to do this without actively embracing mobile 
45 
device usage because most of the employees worked at their desks at the company’s single location.  
46 
Over the years, the Great Seneca Accounting company grew from a local company, where all of its 
47 
employees performed work at their desks by using desktop computers provided by the organization, 
48 
into a regional firm with employees who work remotely and who support regional customers.  
49 
Now, many of the employees spend part of their week traveling and working from customer or other 
50 
remote locations. This has prompted the organization to specify, as a strategic priority, the need to 
51 
support employees to work remotely, while both traveling and working from a customer location. As 
52 
such, the company wants to embrace BYOD solutions to support its remote work. 
53 
Figure 1-1 shows an overview of the typical work environments for a Great Seneca Accounting 
54 
employee. Many employees work remotely while using their own mobile phones and tablets to perform 
55 
both work and personal activities throughout the day.

Great Seneca Accounting’s corporate management initiated a complete review of all policies, 
58 
procedures, and technology relating to its mobile deployment to ensure that the company is well 
59 
protected against attacks involving personal mobile devices. This includes mitigating risks against its 
60 
devices, custom applications, and corporate infrastructure supporting mobile services. Management 
61 
identified NIST’s Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] and Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology 
62 
(PRAM) [6] as useful tools for supporting this analysis. The company developed Cybersecurity 
63 
Framework and Privacy Framework Target Profiles to guide Great Seneca Accounting’s decision-making 
64 
because the Target Profiles link Great Seneca Accounting’s mission and business priorities with 
65 
supporting cybersecurity and privacy activities.  
66 
Great Seneca Accounting identified the scope of their mobile solution to be both Android and Apple 
67 
personally owned mobile phones and tablets. While this example scenario intends to provide an 
68 
exemplar of organization guidance with a description of BYOD concepts and how to apply those 
69 
concepts, this example scenario should not suggest a limit on BYOD uses.  
70 
Great Seneca Accounting plans to use NIST SP 1800-22 (this practice guide) to inform its updated BYOD 
71 
architecture as well as NIST’s Mobile Threat Catalogue to identify threats to mobile deployment. These 
72 
NIST frameworks and tools used are described further in Appendix E.  
73 
As shown in Figure 2-1, this example solution applied multiple mobile device security technologies. 
74 
These included a cloud-based Enterprise Mobility Management solution integrated with cloud- and 
75 
agent-based mobile security technologies to help deploy a set of security and privacy capabilities that 
76 
support the example solution.

Figure 2-2 shows the overall process that Great Seneca Accounting plans to follow. It highlights key 
79 
activities from various NIST guidance documents related to security and privacy risk management, each 
80 
of which is discussed in the sections identified in Figure 2-2. Please note that this process is an 
81 
abbreviated version of steps provided in NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2 [7], which shows how some available 
82 
resources may be used by any organization.

2.1 Great Seneca Accounting’s Business/Mission Objectives 
85 
Great Seneca Accounting developed a mission statement and a set of supporting business/mission 
86 
objectives to ensure that its activities align with its core purpose. The company has had the same 
87 
mission since it was founded: 
88

Mission Statement 
89 
Provide financial services with integrity and responsiveness 
90 
While Great Seneca Accounting has a number of business/mission objectives, those below relate to its 
91 
interest in BYOD, listed in priority order: 
92 
1. Provide good data stewardship. 
93 
2. Enable timely communication with clients. 
94 
3. Provide innovative financial services. 
95 
4. Enable workforce flexibility. 
96 
3 Great Seneca Accounting’s Target Profiles 
97 
Great Seneca Accounting used the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and NIST Privacy Framework as key 
98 
strategic planning tools to improve its security and privacy programs. It followed the processes outlined 
99 
in the frameworks, and as part of that effort, created two Target Profiles—one for cybersecurity and one 
100 
for privacy.  
101 
These Target Profiles describe the desired or aspirational state of Great Seneca Accounting by 
102 
identifying and prioritizing the cybersecurity and privacy activities and outcomes needed to support its 
103 
enterprise business/mission objectives. The Subcategories in each Framework Core articulate those 
104 
cybersecurity and privacy activities and outcomes.  
105 
Note: See Appendix E for a high-level description of the Cybersecurity Framework and Privacy 
106 
Framework.  
107 
To understand what Subcategories to prioritize implementing in each framework, Great Seneca 
108 
Accounting considered the importance of the Subcategories for accomplishing each business/mission 
109 
objective. The Target Profiles reflect that discussion by designating prioritized Subcategories as low, 
110 
moderate, or high.  
111 
Subcategory improvements important for BYOD deployment also became part of its Target Profiles 
112 
because Great Seneca Accounting was upgrading its existing information technology infrastructure as 
113 
part of its BYOD implementation.  
114 
The Cybersecurity Framework Target Profile in Table 3-1 and the Privacy Framework Target Profile in 
115 
Table 3-2 are included as examples of Great Seneca Accounting’s identification of the business/mission 
116 
objectives that are relevant to their BYOD deployment. 
117 
Great Seneca Accounting chose to address the Subcategories that are prioritized as moderate and high 
118 
for multiple business/mission objectives in its Target Profiles for this year’s BYOD deployment with plans 
119 
to address the low Subcategories in the future.  
120 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device

Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 include only those Subcategories that are prioritized as moderate or high for the 
121 
business/mission Objectives. Any Subcategory designated as low is included in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 
122 
only because it is high or moderate for another business/mission objective.  
123 
Great Seneca Accounting used the Target Profiles to help guide risk management decisions throughout 
124 
the organization’s activities, including making decisions regarding budget allocation, technology design, 
125 
and staffing for its programs and technology deployments. Discussions for developing and using the 
126 
Target Profiles include stakeholders in various parts of the organization, such as business/mission 
127 
program owners, data stewards, cybersecurity practitioners, privacy practitioners, legal and compliance 
128 
experts, and technology experts. 
129 
Note: Low, moderate, and high designations indicate the level of relative importance among 
130 
Subcategories for Great Seneca to accomplish a business/mission objective.

4 Great Seneca Accounting Embraces BYOD 
134 
Great Seneca Accounting now allows its staff to use their personal mobile devices to perform their daily 
135 
work duties on an as-needed basis. Accountants use the devices for various tasks including 
136 
communicating with client organizations and other employees, collecting confidential client information, 
137 
analyzing financial transactions, generating reports, accessing tax and payroll information, and creating 
138 
and reviewing comprehensive financial statements.  
139 
Great Seneca accountants work from many locations including their corporate office building, their 
140 
homes, their customers’ offices, and other locations. And to be able to work in all of these locations, 
141 
they require the use of mobile devices to perform their job functions. 
142 
Great Seneca Accounting’s current mobile infrastructure enables accountants to perform their job 
143 
duties by using their personally owned devices, despite minimal security installed and enforced on these 
144 
devices. Examples of security concerns with the use of personally owned devices are: 
145 
 
Employees can connect to any Wi-Fi network to perform work-related activities when they are 
146 
working on the road, including at a client’s site.  
147 
 
Custom mobile applications being sideloaded onto devices that employees use.  
148 
 
The personally owned devices allow users to install applications on an as-needed basis without 
149 
separation of enterprise and personal data.  
150 
While not affecting Great Seneca Accounting, a string of well-publicized cybersecurity attacks have 
151 
recently been reported in the news, and this prompted Great Seneca to review its mobile device security 
152 
and privacy deployment strategy. When making BYOD deployment decisions, Great Seneca Accounting 
153 
plans to prioritize implementing cybersecurity and privacy capabilities that would enable it to 
154 
accomplish its business/mission objectives (i.e., its reasons for deploying BYOD capabilities).  
155 
To do this, Great Seneca Accounting conducted a technical assessment of its current BYOD architecture 
156 
to help it understand ways to improve the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of data and 
157 
devices associated with its BYOD deployment. The company identified several vulnerabilities based on 
158 
its current mobile device deployment. Figure 4-1 below presents a subset of those vulnerabilities. 
159 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
15 
Figure 4-1 Great Seneca Accounting’s Current Mobile Deployment Architecture (Before Security and 
160 
Privacy Enhancements) 
161 
 
Figure 4-1 highlights the following vulnerabilities with a red exclamation mark: 
162 
1. BYOD deployments can place organizational and personal data, as well as employees’ privacy, at 
163 
risk. Organizational and personal data can become commingled if either the same application is 
164 
used in both contexts or if multiple applications access shared device resources (e.g., contacts or 
165 
calendar) as applications for both personal and work usage are installed. This also puts 
166 
employees’ privacy at risk, as the organization can have visibility into their personal life outside 
167 
work. 
168 
2. BYOD deployments can leverage nonsecure networks. As employees use nonsecure Wi-Fi 
169 
hotspots, mobile devices that are connecting to Great Seneca Accounting from those 
170 
unencrypted networks place data transmitted prior to a secure connection at risk of discovery 
171 
and eavesdropping, including passwords. 
172 
3. As employees install applications on their personally owned devices, the applications can have 
173 
unidentified vulnerabilities or weaknesses that increase the risk of device compromise (e.g., 
174 
applications that access contacts may now have access to the organization’s client contact 
175 
information). Further, legitimate, privacy-intrusive applications can legally collect data through 
176 
terms and conditions and requested permissions. 
177 
4. On personally owned devices without restriction policies in place, employees may inadvertently 
178 
download applications outside official application stores, which are malware in disguise.  
179 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
16 
5. Because personally owned mobile devices can connect from unknown locations, firewall rules 
180 
must allow inbound connections from unrecognized, potentially malicious Internet Protocol 
181 
addresses. 
182 
In addition to identifying the technical assets and the vulnerabilities, Great Seneca Accounting identified 
183 
the scope of the mobile solution (i.e., both Android and Apple personally owned mobile phones and 
184 
tablets) and the regulatory requirements or guidance that will apply to their deployment and solution 
185 
(e.g., encryption will be Federal Information Processing Standards [FIPS]-validated to protect sensitive 
186 
accounting information).  
187 
5 Applying NIST Risk Management Methodologies to Great 
188 
Seneca Accounting’s BYOD Architecture 
189 
Sections 2 and 3 described Great Seneca Accounting, their business mission, and what security and 
190 
privacy areas they consider most important. Great Seneca created Target Profiles that mapped their 
191 
BYOD-related mission/business objectives and priorities with the Functions, Categories, and 
192 
Subcategories of both the Cybersecurity Framework and the Privacy Framework. Those Cybersecurity 
193 
Framework and Privacy Framework Target Profiles are provided in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 in Section 3 
194 
of this document. 
195 
Now, the Target Profiles provided in Section 3 will demonstrate the role they play in identifying and 
196 
prioritizing the implementation of the security and privacy controls, as well as the capabilities that Great 
197 
Seneca would like to include in its new BYOD security and privacy-enhanced architecture.  
198 
5.1 Using Great Seneca Accounting’s Target Profiles 
199 
The Cybersecurity Framework maps its Subcategories to Informative References. The Informative 
200 
References contained in the Framework Core provide examples of methods that Great Seneca can use 
201 
to achieve its desired outcomes. The Cybersecurity Framework’s Subcategory and Informative 
202 
References mappings include NIST SP 800-53 controls. 
203 
An illustrative segment of the Cybersecurity Framework’s Framework Core is shown in Figure 5-1. 
204 
Highlighted in the green box is an example of how the Cybersecurity Framework provides a mapping of 
205 
Subcategories to Informative References.

Figure 5-1 Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory to Informative Reference Mapping 
207 
 
To provide a starting point for Great Seneca’s mapping of their Cybersecurity Framework and Privacy 
208 
Framework Target Profiles to the NIST SP 800-53 security and privacy controls and capabilities, Great 
209 
Seneca leveraged the mapping provided in the Cybersecurity Framework. An example of the 
210 
Cybersecurity Framework’s mapping is provided in Figure 5-1.  
211 
See Volume B’s Appendixes G and H for additional information on the security and privacy outcomes 
212 
that this document’s example solution supports. Appendixes G and H provide a mapping of this 
213 
document’s example solution capabilities with the related Subcategories in the Cybersecurity 
214 
Framework and Privacy Framework.  
215 
Volume B’s Appendix G provides the Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory mappings, and Volume B’s 
216 
Appendix H provides the Privacy Framework Subcategory mappings. An excerpt of Volume B’s Appendix 
217 
G is shown below in Figure 5-2.

220 
5.2 Great Seneca Uses the Target Profiles to Help Prioritize Security and 
221 
Privacy Control Deployment 
222 
Due to budget constraints, Great Seneca Accounting will focus on implementing the higher priority 
223 
security and privacy controls that were identified in the organization’s two Target Profiles first. The 
224 
company will then focus on implementing lower priority controls when more funding becomes available. 
225 
This is accomplished by Great Seneca Accounting comparing the prioritized Subcategories contained in 
226 
Section 3’s Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 with the outcomes that the example solution supports. 
227 
By comparing its Cybersecurity Framework Target Profile (Table 3-1) with the Subcategories supported 
228 
by the example solution that are shown in Volume B’s Appendix G, Great Seneca Accounting determines 
229 
that the example solution will help it achieve its desired Cybersecurity Framework Target Profile 
230 
outcomes.  
231 
Great Seneca performs a similar comparison of the Privacy Framework Target Profile in Table 3-2 with 
232 
the Subcategories supported by the example solution that are shown in Volume B’s Appendix H. From 
233 
that comparison of the example solution’s capabilities and Great Seneca’s privacy-related architecture 
234 
goals, Great Seneca determines that the example solution provided in this practice guide will help it to 
235 
achieve the privacy-related outcomes that were identified in Table 3-2’s Privacy Framework Target 
236 
Profile. 
237 
5.2.1 Identifying and Tailoring the Baseline Controls 
238 
Now that Great Seneca Accounting understands how the Target Profiles will help prioritize the 
239 
implementation of the high-level security and privacy goals shown in Figure 5-3, it would like to look 
240 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
19 
more closely at the NIST SP 800-53 controls it will initially implement in its new BYOD architecture. This 
241 
will help Great Seneca identify the capabilities it will deploy first to meet its architecture needs.  
242 
Figure 5-3 Security and Privacy Goals 
243 
 
244 
Volume B’s Appendix G and H provide a list of the controls that the example solution implements, 
245 
including how the controls in the example solution align to the Subcategories in both the Cybersecurity 
246 
Framework and Privacy Framework. Because these controls only focus on the example solution, Great 
247 
Seneca will need to implement additional controls that address the unique risks associated with its 
248 
environment. 
249 
To help identify the specific controls Great Seneca Accounting will be implementing to support the new 
250 
BYOD architecture, it uses the NIST RMF process to manage security and privacy risk for its systems. The 
251 
organization decides to follow the RMF guidance in NIST SP 800-37 [7] to conduct security and privacy 
252 
risk assessments as it continues preparing to design its new solution.  
253 
5.3 Great Seneca Accounting Performs a Risk Assessment 
254 
Great Seneca Accounting completes a security risk assessment by using the guidance in NIST SP 800-30 
255 
[8] and the Mobile Threat Catalogue [5] to identify cybersecurity threats to the organization. The 
256 
company then uses the NIST PRAM [6] to perform a privacy risk assessment. Appendix F and G describe 
257 
these risk assessments in more detail. These risk assessments produce two significant conclusions: 
258 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
20 
1. Great Seneca Accounting finds similar cybersecurity threats in its environment and problematic 
259 
data actions for employee privacy as those discussed in NIST SP 1800-22, validating that the 
260 
controls discussed in the example solution are relevant to their environment.  
261 
2. The organization determines that it has a high-impact system, based on the impact guidance in 
262 
NIST FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems 
263 
[9], and needs to implement more controls beyond those identified in NIST SP 1800-22 and its 
264 
Target Profiles to support the additional system components in its own solution (e.g., underlying 
265 
OS, the data center where the equipment will reside).  
266 
5.4 Great Seneca Accounting Tailors Their Security and Privacy Control 
267 
Baselines 
268 
As part of their review of NIST FIPS 200 [9], Great Seneca Accounting selects the high controls baseline in 
269 
NIST SP 800-53 [10] for their BYOD architecture implementation. They then tailor the control baselines 
270 
based on the needs identified through the priority Subcategories in its cybersecurity and privacy Target 
271 
Profiles.  
272 
Control baselines are tailored to meet their organization’s needs. NIST SP 800-53 [10] defines tailoring as 
273 
“The process by which security control baselines are modified by: (i) identifying and designating 
274 
common controls; (ii) applying scoping considerations on the applicability and implementation of 
275 
baseline controls; (iii) selecting compensating security controls; (iv) assigning specific values to 
276 
organization-defined security control parameters; (v) supplementing baselines with additional security 
277 
controls or control enhancements; and (vi) providing additional specification information for control 
278 
implementation.” 
279 
While not discussed in this example scenario, Great Seneca also plans to make tailoring decisions based 
280 
on other unique needs in its environment (e.g., legal and regulatory requirements). 
281 
5.4.1 An Example Tailoring of the System and Communications Protection Security 
282 
Control Family 
283 
As Great Seneca Accounting reviews the System and Communications Protection (SC) control family in 
284 
NIST SP 800-53 [10], it notes there are opportunities for tailoring.  
285 
For example, the NIST SP 800-53 baseline includes control enhancements, whereas the Cybersecurity 
286 
Framework Informative References contain only base controls. Great Seneca Accounting decides to 
287 
implement the enhancements that are applicable to a high-impact system for the SC controls they have 
288 
selected.  
289 
Using this decision as a guide, Great Seneca Accounting also makes the following tailoring decisions 
290 
related to the NIST SP 800-53 SC control family: 
291 
 
NIST SP 800-53 provides recommendations regarding implementation priorities for controls. The 
292 
implementation priorities of controls related to some Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories 
293 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
21 
were adjusted to be higher or lower based on their alignment with Subcategory prioritization in 
294 
the Target Profile.  
295 
 
For example, the implementation priority for Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory DE.CM-5 
296 
was identified as having low or moderate importance for accomplishing all four BYOD-Related 
297 
Business/Mission Objectives. NIST SP 800-53 designates control SC-18, which supports the 
298 
implementation of Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory DE.CM-5, as high priority. However, 
299 
since Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory DE.CM-5 is moderate or low priority in this context, 
300 
Great Seneca makes a tailoring decision to lower the implementation priority for the SC-18 NIST 
301 
SP 800-53 control to moderate.  
302 
o DE.CM-5’s importance designations for accomplishing the BYOD-Related 
303 
Business/Mission Objectives are highlighted in green in Figure 5-4.  
304 
Figure 5-4 Subcategory DE.CM-5 Mapping to BYOD-Related Business/Mission Objectives 
305 
 
306 
 
Conversely, just as the implementation priority for the NIST SP 800-53 control that supports 
307 
implementation of Subcategory DC-CM-5 was lowered based on the Target Profile, the 
308 
implementation priority for the NIST SP 800-53 controls that supports implementation of 
309 
Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory PR.AC-5 was raised. This is because Subcategory PR.AC-5 
310 
was identified as having high importance for accomplishing all four BYOD-Related 
311 
Business/Mission Objectives.  
312 
o The NIST SP 800-53 SC Family security control related to the Cybersecurity Framework 
313 
Subcategory PR.AC-5 is SC-7. NIST SP 800-53 prioritizes control SC-7 as low. Since control 
314 
SC-7 supports the implementation of a Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory that is 
315 
designated as high priority in Great Seneca’s Target Profile (Cybersecurity Framework 
316 
Subcategory PR.AC-5), Great Seneca makes a tailoring decision to increase the priority of 
317 
NIST SP 800-53 control SC-7 to high. 
318 
o PR.AC-5’s high importance designation for accomplishing the BYOD-Related 
319 
Business/Mission Objectives are highlighted in green in Figure 5-5. All Subcategory 
320 
prioritizations (including PR.AC-5’s shown below) can be found in Table 3-1. 
321

NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
22 
Figure 5-5 Subcategory PR.AC-5 Mapping to BYOD-Related Business/Mission Objectives 
322 
 
323 
Great Seneca Accounting follows the same approach for the privacy controls in NIST SP 800-53, using 
324 
the Privacy Framework Target Profile and controls identified through its PRAM analysis (for more 
325 
information reference Appendix G).  
326 
Great Seneca Accounting will evaluate the security controls as they come up for review under its 
327 
continuous monitoring program to determine whether there are enhancements to the implemented 
328 
security controls that can be made over time. 
329 
In addition to identifying controls to select, the priorities articulated in Target Profiles will also help 
330 
Great Seneca Accounting decide how to align financial resources for controls implementation (e.g., 
331 
buying a tool to automate a control as opposed to relying on policy and procedures alone). The Target 
332 
Profiles will help Great Seneca identify how robustly to re-assess the efficacy of implemented controls 
333 
before new system components or capabilities are enabled in a production environment. Great Seneca 
334 
will also be able to use the Target Profiles to help evaluate the residual risks of the architecture in the 
335 
context of Great Seneca Accounting’s business/mission objectives, and the frequency and depth of 
336 
continued monitoring requirements over time. 
337 
Note: All of the tailoring decisions discussed above are for example purposes only. An organization’s 
338 
actual tailoring decision will be based upon their own unique business/mission objectives, risk 
339 
assessment results, and organizational needs that may significantly vary from these examples.

Access 
Management 
Access Management is the set of practices that enables only those permitted the 
ability to perform an action on a particular resource. The three most common Access 
Management services you encounter every day perhaps without realizing it are: 
Policy Administration, Authentication, and Authorization [11]. 
Availability 
Ensure that users can access resources through remote access whenever needed 
[12]. 
Bring Your 
Own Device 
(BYOD) 
A non-organization-controlled telework client device [12]. 
Confidentiality Ensure that remote access communications and stored user data cannot be read by 
unauthorized parties [12]. 
Data Actions 
System operations that process PII [13]. 
Disassociability Enabling the processing of PII or events without association to individuals or devices 
beyond the operational requirements of the system [13]. 
Eavesdropping An attack in which an Attacker listens passively to the authentication protocol to 
capture information which can be used in a subsequent active attack to masquerade 
as the Claimant [14] (definition located under eavesdropping attack). 
Firewall 
Firewalls are devices or programs that control the flow of network traffic between 
networks or hosts that employ differing security postures [15]. 
Integrity 
Detect any intentional or unintentional changes to remote access communications 
that occur in transit [12]. 
Manageability Providing the capability for granular administration of PII including alteration, 
deletion, and selective disclosure [13]. 
Mobile Device A portable computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily 
be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical 
connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, 
non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power 
source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board 
sensors that allow the devices to capture information, and/or built-in features for 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
25 
synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, 
tablets, and E-readers [10]. 
Personally 
Identifiable 
Information 
(PII) 
Any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including any 
information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as 
name, Social Security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or 
biometric records; and any other information that is linked or linkable to an 
individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information [16] 
(adapted from Government Accountability Office Report 08-536). 
 
Problematic 
Data Action 
A data action that could cause an adverse effect for individuals [2]. 
Threat 
Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational 
operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, 
individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via 
unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or 
denial of service [8]. 
Vulnerability 
Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or 
implementation that could be exploited by a threat source [8].

This fictional organization demonstrates how a small-to-medium sized, regional organization imple-
400 
mented the example solution in this practice guide to assess and protect their mobile-device-specific 
401 
security and privacy needs. It illustrates how organizations with office-based, remote-working, and trav-
402 
elling personnel can be supported in their use of personally owned devices that enable their employees 
403 
to work while on the road, in the office, at customer locations, and at home.

Appendix E How Great Seneca Accounting Applied NIST Risk 
406 
Management Methodologies 
407 
This practice guide contains an example scenario about a fictional organization called Great Seneca 
408 
Accounting. The example scenario shows how to deploy a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) solution to be 
409 
in alignment with an organization’s security and privacy capabilities and objectives. 
410 
The example scenario uses National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, guidance, 
411 
and tools. It is provided in the Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice supplement of this 
412 
practice guide.  
413 
This appendix provides a brief description of some of the key NIST tools referenced in the example 
414 
scenario supplement of this practice guide. 
415 
In this Appendix, Section E.1 provides descriptions of the risk frameworks and tools, along with a high-
416 
level discussion of how Great Seneca Accounting applied each framework or tool in the example 
417 
scenario. Section E.2 describes how the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and NIST Privacy Framework can 
418 
be used to establish or improve cybersecurity and privacy programs. 
419 
E.1 Overview of Risk Frameworks and Tools That Great Seneca Used 
420 
Great Seneca used NIST frameworks and tools to identify common security and privacy risks related to 
421 
BYOD solutions and to guide approaches to how they were addressed in the architecture described in 
422 
Section 4. Great Seneca used additional standards and guidance, listed in Appendix D of Volume B, to 
423 
complement these frameworks and tools when designing their BYOD architecture. 
424 
Both the Cybersecurity Framework and Privacy Framework include the concept of Framework Profiles, 
425 
which identify the organization’s existing activities (contained in a Current Profile) and articulate the 
426 
desired outcomes that support its mission and business objectives within its risk tolerance (that are 
427 
contained in the Target Profile). When considered together, Current and Target Profiles are useful tools 
428 
for identifying gaps and for strategic planning. 
429 
E.1.1 Overview of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 
430 
Description: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework “is voluntary guidance, based on existing standards, 
431 
guidelines, and practices for organizations to better manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. In addition to 
432 
helping organizations manage and reduce risks, it was designed to foster risk and cybersecurity 
433 
management communications amongst both internal and external organizational stakeholders.” [17]  
434 
Application: This guide refers to two of the main components of the Cybersecurity Framework: the 
435 
Framework Core and the Framework Profiles. As described in Section 2.1 of the Cybersecurity 
436 
Framework, the Framework Core provides a set of activities to achieve specific cybersecurity outcomes, 
437 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
30 
and reference examples of guidance to achieve those outcomes (e.g., controls found in NIST Special 
438 
Publication [SP] 800-53). Section 2.3 of the Cybersecurity Framework identifies Framework Profiles as 
439 
the alignment of the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories (i.e., the Framework Core) with the 
440 
business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization.  
441 
The Great Seneca Accounting example scenario assumed that the organization used the Cybersecurity 
442 
Framework Core and Framework Profiles, specifically the Target Profiles, to align cybersecurity 
443 
outcomes and activities with its overall business/mission objectives for the organization. In the case of 
444 
Great Seneca Accounting, its Cybersecurity Framework Target Profile helps program owners and system 
445 
architects understand business and mission-driven priorities and the types of cybersecurity capabilities 
446 
needed to achieve them. Great Seneca Accounting also used the NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8170, 
447 
The Cybersecurity Framework, Implementation Guidance for Federal Agencies [18], for guidance in using 
448 
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. 
449 
E.1.2 Overview of the NIST Privacy Framework 
450 
Description: The NIST Privacy Framework is a voluntary enterprise risk management tool intended to 
451 
help organizations identify and manage privacy risk and build beneficial products and services while 
452 
protecting individuals’ privacy. It follows the structure of the Cybersecurity Framework to facilitate using 
453 
both frameworks together [2]. 
454 
Application: This guide refers to two of the main components of the Privacy Framework: the Framework 
455 
Core and Framework Profiles. As described in Section 2.1 of the Privacy Framework, the Framework 
456 
Core provides an increasingly granular set of activities and outcomes that enable dialog about managing 
457 
privacy risk as well as resources to achieve those outcomes (e.g., guidance in NISTIR 8062, An 
458 
Introduction to Privacy Engineering and Risk Management in Federal Systems [13]). Section 2.2 of the 
459 
Privacy Framework identifies Framework Profiles as the selection of specific Functions, Categories, and 
460 
Subcategories from the core that an organization has prioritized to help it manage privacy risk.  
461 
Great Seneca Accounting used the Privacy Framework as a strategic planning tool for its privacy program 
462 
as well as its system, product, and service teams. The Great Seneca Accounting example scenario 
463 
assumed that the organization used the Privacy Framework Core and Framework Profiles, specifically 
464 
Target Profiles, to align privacy outcomes and activities with its overall business/mission objectives for 
465 
the organization. Its Privacy Framework Target Profile helped program owners and system architects to 
466 
understand business and mission-driven priorities and the types of privacy capabilities needed to 
467 
achieve them. 
468 
E.1.3 Overview of the NIST Risk Management Framework 
469 
Description: The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) “provides a process that integrates security 
470 
and risk management activities into the system development life cycle. The risk-based approach to 
471 
security control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to 
472 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
31 
applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations” [19]. Two of the key 
473 
documents that describe the RMF are NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for 
474 
Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy; and NIST 
475 
SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments. 
476 
Application: The RMF has seven steps: Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, and 
477 
Monitor. These steps provide a method for organizations to characterize the risk posture of their 
478 
information and systems and identify controls that are commensurate with the risks in the system’s 
479 
environment. They also support organizations with selecting beneficial implementation and assessment 
480 
approaches, reasoning through the process to understand residual risks, and monitoring the efficacy of 
481 
implemented controls over time. 
482 
The Great Seneca Accounting example solution touches on the risk assessment activities conducted 
483 
under the Prepare step, identifying the overall risk level of the BYOD system architecture in the 
484 
Categorize step, and, consistent with example approach 8 in NISTIR 8170, reasoning through the 
485 
controls that are necessary in the Select step. The influence of the priorities provided in Great Seneca 
486 
Accounting’s Cybersecurity Framework Target Profile is also briefly mentioned regarding making 
487 
decisions for how to apply controls during Implement (e.g., policy versus tools), how robustly to verify 
488 
and validate controls during Assess (e.g., document review versus “hands on the keyboard” system 
489 
testing), and the degree of evaluation required over time as part of the Monitor step.  
490 
E.1.4 Overview of the NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology 
491 
Description: The NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM) is a tool for analyzing, assessing, 
492 
and prioritizing privacy risks to help organizations determine how to respond and select appropriate 
493 
solutions. A blank version of the PRAM is available for download on NIST’s website.  
494 
Application: The PRAM uses the privacy risk model and privacy engineering objectives described in 
495 
NISTIR 8062 to analyze for potential problematic data actions. Data actions are any system operations 
496 
that process data. Processing can include, collection, retention, logging, analysis, generation, 
497 
transformation or merging, disclosure, transfer, and disposal of data. A problematic data action is one 
498 
that could cause an adverse effect, or problem, for individuals. The occurrence or potential occurrence 
499 
of problematic data actions is a privacy event. While there is a growing body of technical privacy 
500 
controls, including those found in NIST SP 800-53, applying the PRAM may result in identifying controls 
501 
that are not yet available in common standards. This makes it an especially useful tool for managing 
502 
risks that may otherwise go unaddressed.  
503 
The Great Seneca Accounting example solution assumed that a PRAM was used to identify problematic 
504 
data actions and mitigating controls for employees. The controls in this build include some technical 
505 
controls, such as controls that can be handled by security capabilities, as well as policy and procedure-
506 
level controls that need to be implemented outside yet supported by the system.

E.2 Using Frameworks to Establish or Improve Cybersecurity and Privacy 
508 
Programs 
509 
While their presentation differs, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and NIST Privacy Framework also 
510 
both provide complementary guidance for establishing and improving cybersecurity and privacy 
511 
programs. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework’s process for establishing or improving programs provides 
512 
seven steps that an organization could use iteratively and as necessary throughout the program’s life 
513 
cycle to continually improve its cybersecurity posture: 
514 
 
Step 1: Prioritize and scope the organization’s mission. 
515 
 
Step 2: Orient its cybersecurity program activities to focus efforts on applicable areas.  
516 
 
Step 3: Create a current profile of what security areas it currently supports. 
517 
 
Step 4: Conduct a risk assessment. 
518 
 
Step 5: Create a Target Profile of the security areas that the organization would like to improve 
519 
in the future. 
520 
 
Step 6: Determine, analyze, and prioritize cybersecurity gaps. 
521 
 
Step 7: Implement an action plan to close those gaps. 
522 
The NIST Privacy Framework includes the same types of activities for establishing and improving privacy 
523 
programs, described in a three-stage Ready, Set, Go model. Figure E-1 below shows a comparison of 
524 
these two approaches, demonstrating their close alignment.

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
33 
Figure E-1 Comparing Framework Processes to Establish or Improve Programs 
526 
 
 
Both approaches are equally effective. Regardless of the approach selected, an organization begins with 
527 
orienting around its business/mission objectives and high-level organizational priorities and carry out 
528 
the remaining activities in a way that makes the most sense for the organization. The organization 
529 
repeats these steps as necessary throughout the program’s life cycle to continually improve its risk 
530 
posture.

Appendix F 
How Great Seneca Accounting Used the NIST 
532 
Risk Management Framework 
533 
This practice guide contains an example scenario about a fictional organization called Great Seneca 
534 
Accounting. The example scenario shows how to deploy a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) solution to be 
535 
in alignment with an organization’s security and privacy capabilities and objectives. 
536 
The example scenario uses National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, guidance, 
537 
and tools. It is provided in the Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice supplement of this 
538 
practice guide.  
539 
In the example scenario supplement of this practice guide, Great Seneca Accounting decided to use the 
540 
NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the NIST Privacy Framework, and the NIST Risk Management Framework 
541 
to help improve its mobile device architecture. The following material provides information about how 
542 
Great Seneca Accounting used the NIST Risk Management Framework to improve its BYOD deployment. 
543 
F.1 Understanding the Risk Assessment Process 
544 
This section provides information on the risk assessment process employed to improve the mobile 
545 
security posture of Great Seneca Accounting. Typically, a risk assessment based on NIST SP 800-30 
546 
Revision 1 follows a four-step process as shown in Figure F-1: prepare for assessment, conduct 
547 
assessment, communicate results, and maintain assessment.

F.2 Risk Assessment of Great Seneca Accounting’s BYOD Program 
550 
This risk assessment is scoped to Great Seneca Accounting’s mobile deployment, which includes the 
551 
mobile devices used to access Great Seneca Accounting’s enterprise resources, along with any 
552 
information technology components used to manage or provide services to those mobile devices. 
553 
Risk assessment assumptions and constraints were developed by using a NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 
554 
generic risk model as shown in Figure F-2 to identify the following components of the risk assessment: 
555 


F.3 Development of Threat Event Descriptions 
564 
Great Seneca Accounting developed threat event tables based on NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 and used 
565 
those to help analyze the sources of mobile threats. Using this process, Great Seneca Accounting 
566 
leadership identified the following potential mobile device threat events that are described in the 
567 
following subsections.

F.4 Great Seneca Accounting’s Leadership and Technical Teams Discuss 
576 
BYOD’s Potential Threats to Their Organization 
577 
Great Seneca Accounting’s leadership team wanted to understand real-world examples of each threat 
578 
event and what the risk was for each. Great Seneca Accounting’s leadership and technical teams then 
579 
discussed those possible threats that BYOD could introduce to their organization.  
580 
The analysis performed by Great Seneca Accounting’s technical team included analyzing the likelihood 
581 
of each threat, the level of impact, and the threat level that the BYOD deployment would pose. The 
582 
following are leadership’s questions and the technical team’s responses regarding BYOD threats during 
583 
that discussion using real-world examples. A goal of the example solution contained within this practice 
584 
guide is to mitigate the impact of these threat events. Reference Table 5-1 for a listing of the technology 
585 
that addresses each of the following threat events. 
586 
F.4.1 Threat Event 1  
587 
What happens if an employee installs risky applications? 
588 
A mobile application can attempt to collect and exfiltrate any information to which it has been granted 
589 
access. This includes any information generated during use of the application (e.g., user input), user-
590 
granted permissions (e.g., contacts, calendar, call logs, photos), and general device data available to any 
591 
application (e.g., International Mobile Equipment Identity, device make and model, serial number). 
592 
Further, if a malicious application exploits a vulnerability in other applications, the operating system 
593 
(OS), or device firmware to achieve privilege escalation, it may gain unauthorized access to any data 
594 
stored on or otherwise accessible through the device. 
595 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
39 
Risk assessment analysis: 
596 
Overall likelihood: very high 
597 
Justification: Employees have access to download any application at any time. If an employee requires 
598 
an application that provides a desired function, the employee can download that application from any 
599 
available source (trusted or untrusted) that provides a desired function. If an application performs an 
600 
employee’s desired function, the employee may download an application from an untrusted source 
601 
and/or disregard granted privacy permissions. 
602 
Level of impact: high 
603 
Justification: Employees may download an application from an untrusted source and/or disregard 
604 
granted privacy permissions. This poses a threat for sensitive corporate data, as some applications may 
605 
include features that could access corporate data, unbeknownst to the user. 
606 
BYOD-specific threat: In a BYOD scenario, users are still able to download and install applications at 
607 
their leisure. This capability allows users to unintentionally side-load or install a malicious application 
608 
that may harm the device or the enterprise information on the device. 
609 
F.4.2 Threat Event 2 
610 
Can account information be stolen through phishing? 
611 
Malicious actors may create fraudulent websites that mimic the appearance and behavior of legitimate 
612 
ones and entice users to authenticate to them by distributing phishing messages over short message 
613 
service (SMS) or email. Effective social engineering techniques such as impersonating an authority figure 
614 
or creating a sense of urgency may compel users to forgo scrutinizing the message and proceed to 
615 
authenticate to the fraudulent website; it then captures and stores the userʼs credentials before 
616 
(usually) forwarding them to the legitimate website to allay suspicion.  
617 
Risk assessment analysis: 
618 
Overall likelihood: very high 
619 
Justification: Phishing campaigns are a very common threat that occurs almost every day. 
620 
Level of impact: high 
621 
Justification: A successful phishing campaign could provide the malicious actor with corporate 
622 
credentials, allowing access to sensitive corporate data; or personal credentials that could lead to 
623 
compromise of corporate data or infrastructure via other means. 
624 
BYOD-specific threat: The device-level controls applied to personal devices do not inhibit a user’s 
625 
activities. This allows the user to access personal/work messages and emails on their device that could 
626 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
40 
be susceptible to phishing attempts. If the proper controls are not applied to a user’s enterprise 
627 
messages and email, successful phishing attempts could allow an attacker unauthorized access to 
628 
enterprise data.  
629 
F.4.3 Threat Event 3 
630 
How much risk do malicious applications pose to Great Seneca Accounting? 
631 
Malicious actors may send users SMS or email messages that contain a uniform resource locator (URL) 
632 
where a malicious application is hosted. Generally, such messages are crafted using social engineering 
633 
techniques designed to dissuade recipients from scrutinizing the nature of the message, thereby 
634 
increasing the likelihood that they access the URL using their mobile device. If they do, it will attempt to 
635 
download and install the application. Effective use of social engineering by the attacker will further 
636 
compel an otherwise suspicious user to grant any trust required by the developer and all permissions 
637 
requested by the application. Granting the former facilitates installation of other malicious applications 
638 
by the same developer, and granting the latter increases the potential for the application to do direct 
639 
harm. 
640 
Risk assessment analysis: 
641 
Overall likelihood: high 
642 
Justification: Installation of malicious applications via URLs is less common than other phishing attempts. 
643 
The process for side-loading applications requires much more user input and consideration (e.g., 
644 
trusting the developer certificate) than standard phishing, which solely requests a username and 
645 
password. A user may proceed through sideloading an application to acquire a desired capability from 
646 
an application. 
647 
Level of impact: high 
648 
Justification: Once a user installs a malicious side-loaded application, an adversary could gain full access 
649 
to a mobile device, and therefore access to corporate data and credentials, without the user’s 
650 
knowledge. 
651 
BYOD-specific threat: Like Threat Event 1, BYOD deployments may have fewer restrictions to avoid 
652 
preventing the user from performing desired personal functions. This increases the attack surface for 
653 
malicious actors to take advantage. 
654 
F.4.4 Threat Event 4 
655 
What happens when outdated phones access Great Seneca Accounting’s network? 
656 
When malware successfully exploits a code execution vulnerability in the mobile OS or device drivers, 
657 
the delivered code generally executes with elevated privileges and issues commands in the context of 
658 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
41 
the root user or the OS kernel. This may be enough for some malicious actors to accomplish their goal, 
659 
but those that are advanced will usually attempt to install additional malicious tools and to establish a 
660 
persistent presence. If successful, the attacker will be able to launch further attacks against the user, the 
661 
device, or any other systems to which the device connects. As a result, any data stored on, generated 
662 
by, or accessible to the device at that time − or in the future − may be compromised.  
663 
Risk assessment analysis: 
664 
Overall likelihood: high 
665 
Justification: Many public vulnerabilities specific to mobile devices have been seen over the years. In 
666 
these, users can jailbreak iOS devices and root Android devices to download third-party applications and 
667 
apply unique settings/configurations that the device would not typically be able to apply/access.  
668 
Level of impact: high 
669 
Justification: Exploiting a vulnerability allows circumventing security controls and modifying protected 
670 
device data that should not be modified. Jailbroken and rooted devices exploit kernel vulnerabilities and 
671 
allow third-party applications/services root access that can also be used to bypass security controls that 
672 
are built in or applied to a mobile device.  
673 
BYOD-specific threat: As with any device, personal devices are susceptible to device exploitation if not 
674 
properly used or updated. 
675 
F.4.5 Threat Event 5 
676 
Can Great Seneca Accounting stop someone from turning on a camera or microphone? 
677 
Malicious actors with access (authorized or unauthorized) to device sensors (microphone, camera, 
678 
gyroscope, Global Positioning System receiver, and radios) can use them to conduct surveillance. It may 
679 
be directed at the user, as when tracking the device location, or it may be applied more generally, as 
680 
when recording any nearby sounds. Captured sensor data may be immediately useful to a malicious 
681 
actor, such as a recording of an executive meeting. Alternatively, the attacker may analyze the data in 
682 
isolation or in combination with other data to yield sensitive information. For example, a malicious actor 
683 
can use audio recordings of on-device or proximate activity to probabilistically determine user inputs to 
684 
touchscreens and keyboards, essentially turning the device into a remote keylogger. 
685 
Risk assessment analysis: 
686 
Overall likelihood: very high 
687 
Justification: This has been seen on public application stores, with applications allegedly being used for 
688 
data-collection. As mentioned in Threat Event 1, unbeknownst to the user, a downloaded application 
689 
may be granted privacy intrusive permissions that allow access to device sensors.  
690 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
42 
Level of impact: high 
691 
Justification: When the sensors are being misused, the user is typically not alerted. This allows collection 
692 
of sensitive enterprise data, such as location, without knowledge of the user. 
693 
BYOD-specific threat: Applications commonly request access to these sensors. In a BYOD deployment, 
694 
the enterprise does not have control over what personal applications the user installs on their device. 
695 
These personal applications may access sensors on the device and eavesdrop on a user’s enterprise-
696 
related activities (e.g., calls and meetings). 
697 
F.4.6 Threat Event 6 
698 
Is sensitive information protected when the data travels between the employee’s mobile device and 
699 
Great Seneca Accounting’s network? 
700 
Malicious actors can readily eavesdrop on communication over unencrypted, wireless networks such as 
701 
public Wi-Fi access points, which coffee shops and hotels commonly provide. While a device is 
702 
connected to such a network, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to any data sent or 
703 
received by the device for any session that has not already been protected by encryption at either the 
704 
transport or application layers. Even if the transmitted data were encrypted, an attacker would be privy 
705 
to the domains, internet protocol (IP) addresses, and services (as indicated by port numbers) to which 
706 
the device connects; an attacker could use such information in future watering hole or person-in-the-
707 
middle attacks against the device user.  
708 
Additionally, visibility into network-layer traffic enables a malicious actor to conduct side-channel 
709 
attacks against the network’s encrypted messages, which can still result in a loss of confidentiality. 
710 
Further, eavesdropping on unencrypted messages during a handshake to establish an encrypted session 
711 
with another host or endpoint may facilitate attacks that ultimately compromise the security of the 
712 
session. 
713 
Risk assessment analysis: 
714 
Overall likelihood: moderate 
715 
Justification: Unlike installation of an application, installations of enterprise mobility management 
716 
(EMM)/mobile device management (MDM), network, virtual private network (VPN) profiles, and 
717 
certificates require additional effort and understanding from the user to properly implement.  
718 
Level of impact: very high 
719 
Justification: If malicious actor can install malicious configuration profiles or certificates, they would be 
720 
able to perform actions such as decrypting network traffic and possibly even control the device. 
721 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
43 
BYOD-specific threat: Like Threat Event 2, personal devices may not have the benefit of an always-on 
722 
device-wide VPN. This leaves application communications at the discretion of the developer. 
723 
F.4.7 Threat Event 7 
724 
Is Great Seneca Accounting’s data protected from brute-force PIN attacks? 
725 
A malicious actor may be able to obtain a user’s device unlock code by direct observation, side-channel 
726 
attacks, or brute-force attacks. Both the first and second can be attempted with at least proximity to the 
727 
device; only the third technique requires physical access. However, applications with access to any 
728 
peripherals that detect sound or motion (microphone, gyroscope, or accelerometer) can attempt side-
729 
channel attacks that infer the unlock code by detecting taps and swipes to the screen. Once the device 
730 
unlock code has been obtained, a malicious actor with physical access to the device will gain immediate 
731 
access to any data or functionality not already protected by additional access control mechanisms. 
732 
Additionally, if the user employs the device unlock code as a credential to any other systems, the 
733 
malicious actor may further gain unauthorized access to those systems. 
734 
Risk assessment analysis: 
735 
Overall likelihood: moderate 
736 
Justification: Unlike shoulder-surfing to observe a user’s passcode, brute-force attacks are not as 
737 
common or successful due to the built-in deterrent mechanisms. These mechanisms include exponential 
738 
back-off/lockout period and device wipes after a certain number of failed unlock attempts. 
739 
Level of impact: very high 
740 
Justification: If a malicious actor can successfully unlock a device without the user’s permission, they 
741 
could have full control over the user’s corporate account and thus gain unauthorized access to corporate 
742 
data. 
743 
BYOD-specific threat: Because BYODs are prone to travel (e.g., vacations, restaurants, and other 
744 
nonwork locations), the risk that the device’s passcode is obtained increases due to the heightened 
745 
exposure to threats in different environments.  
746 
F.4.8 Threat Event 8 
747 
Can Great Seneca Accounting protect its data from weak password practices? 
748 
If a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to a mobile device, they also have access to the data and 
749 
applications on that mobile device. The mobile device may contain an organization’s in-house 
750 
applications that a malicious actor can subsequently use to gain access to sensitive data or backend 
751 
services. This could result from weaknesses or vulnerabilities present in the authentication or credential 
752 
storage mechanisms implemented within an in-house application. 
753 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
44 
Risk assessment analysis: 
754 
Overall likelihood: moderate 
755 
Justification: Often applications include hardcoded credentials for the default password of the admin 
756 
account. Default passwords are readily available online. The user might not change these passwords to 
757 
allow access and eliminate the need to remember a password.  
758 
Level of impact: high 
759 
Justification: Successful extraction of the credentials allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to 
760 
enterprise data. 
761 
BYOD-specific threat: The risk of hardcoded credentials residing in an application on the device is the 
762 
same for any mobile device deployment scenario. 
763 
F.4.9 Threat Event 9 
764 
Can unmanaged devices connect to Great Seneca Accounting? 
765 
An employee who accesses enterprise resources from an unmanaged mobile device may expose the 
766 
enterprise to vulnerabilities that may compromise enterprise data. Unmanaged devices do not benefit 
767 
from any security mechanisms deployed by the organization such as mobile threat defense, mobile 
768 
threat intelligence, application vetting services, and mobile security policies. These unmanaged devices 
769 
limit an organization’s visibility into the state of a mobile device, including if a malicious actor 
770 
compromises the device. Therefore, users who violate security policies to gain unauthorized access to 
771 
enterprise resources from such devices risk providing malicious actors with access to sensitive 
772 
organizational data, services, and systems. 
773 
Risk assessment analysis: 
774 
Overall likelihood: very high 
775 
Justification: This may occur accidentally when an employee attempts to access their email or other 
776 
corporate resources.  
777 
Level of impact: high 
778 
Justification: Unmanaged devices pose a sizable security risk because the enterprise has no visibility into 
779 
their security or risk postures of the mobile devices. Due to this lack of visibility, a compromised device 
780 
may allow an attacker to attempt to exfiltrate sensitive enterprise data. 
781 
BYOD-specific threat: The risk of an unmanaged mobile device accessing the enterprise is the same for 
782 
any mobile deployment scenario. 
783

45 
F.4.10  Threat Event 10 
784 
Can Great Seneca Accounting protect its data when a phone is lost or stolen? 
785 
Due to the nature of the small form factor of mobile devices, they can be misplaced or stolen. A 
786 
malicious actor who gains physical custody of a device with inadequate security controls may be able to 
787 
gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources accessible to the device.  
788 
Risk assessment analysis: 
789 
Overall likelihood: very high 
790 
Justification: Mobile devices are small and can be misplaced. Enterprise devices may be lost or stolen at 
791 
the same frequency as personally owned devices. 
792 
Level of impact: high 
793 
Justification: Similar to Threat Event 9, if a malicious actor can gain access to the device, they could 
794 
access sensitive corporate data. 
795 
BYOD-specific threat: Due to the heightened mobility of BYODs, they are more prone to being 
796 
accidentally lost or stolen. 
797 
F.4.11  Threat Event 11 
798 
Can data be protected from unauthorized cloud services? 
799 
If employees violate data management policies by using unmanaged services to store sensitive 
800 
organizational data, the data will be placed outside organizational control, where the organization can 
801 
no longer protect its confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Malicious actors who compromise the 
802 
unauthorized service account or any system hosting that account may gain unauthorized access to the 
803 
data. 
804 
Further, storage of sensitive data in an unmanaged service may subject the user or the organization to 
805 
prosecution for violation of any applicable laws (e.g., exportation of encryption) and may complicate 
806 
efforts by the organization to achieve remediation or recovery from any future losses, such as those 
807 
resulting from public disclosure of trade secrets. 
808 
Risk assessment analysis: 
809 
Overall likelihood: high 
810 
Justification: This could occur either intentionally or accidentally (e.g., taking a screenshot and having 
811 
pictures backed up to an unmanaged cloud service). 
812 
Level of impact: high 
813 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
46 
Justification: Storage in unmanaged services presents a risk to the confidentiality and availability of 
814 
corporate data because the corporation would no longer control it. 
815 
BYOD-specific threat: In a BYOD deployment, employees are more likely to have some backup or 
816 
automated cloud storage solution configured on their device, which may lead to unintentional backup of 
817 
enterprise data. 
818 
F.4.12  Threat Level 12 
819 
Can Great Seneca Accounting protect its data from PIN or password sharing? 
820 
Many individuals choose to share the PIN or password to unlock their personal device with family 
821 
members. This creates a scenario where a nonemployee can access the device, the work applications, 
822 
and therefore the work data.  
823 
Risk assessment analysis: 
824 
Overall likelihood: moderate 
825 
Justification: Even though employees are conditioned almost constantly to protect their work 
826 
passwords, personal device PINs and passwords are not always protected with that same level of 
827 
security. Anytime individuals share a password or PIN, there is increased risk that it might be exposed or 
828 
compromised. 
829 
Level of impact: very high 
830 
Justification: If a malicious actor can bypass a device lock and gain access to the device, they can 
831 
potentially access sensitive corporate data. 
832 
BYOD-specific threat: The passcode of an individual’s personal mobile device is more likely to be shared 
833 
among family and/or friends to provide access to applications (e.g., games). Although sharing passcodes 
834 
may be convenient for personal reasons, this increases the risk of an unauthorized individual gaining 
835 
access to enterprise data through a personal device. 
836

Note 1: Risk is stated in qualitative terms based on the scale in Table I-2 of Appendix I in NIST SP 800-30 
848 
Revision 1 [8]. 
849 
Note 2: The risk rating is derived from both the overall likelihood and level of impact using Table I-2 of 
850 
Appendix I in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 [8]. Because these are modified interval scales, the combined 
851 
overall risk ratings from Table I-2 do not always reflect a strict mathematical average of these two 
852 
variables. The table above demonstrates this where levels of moderate weigh more heavily than other 
853 
ratings. 
854 
Note 3: Ratings of risk relate to the probability and level of adverse effect on organizational operations, 
855 
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the nation. Per NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, 
856 
adverse effects (and the associated risks) range from negligible (i.e., very low risk), limited (i.e., low),

Appendix G 
How Great Seneca Accounting Used the NIST 
860 
Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology 
861 
This practice guide contains an example scenario about a fictional organization called Great Seneca 
862 
Accounting. The example scenario shows how to deploy a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) solution to be 
863 
in alignment with an organization’s security and privacy capabilities and objectives. 
864 
The example scenario uses National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, guidance, 
865 
and tools. It is provided in the Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice supplement of this 
866 
practice guide.  
867 
In the example scenario, Great Seneca Accounting decided to use the NIST Privacy Risk Assessment 
868 
Methodology (PRAM) to conduct a privacy risk assessment and help improve the company’s mobile 
869 
device architecture. The PRAM helps an organization analyze and communicate about how it conducted 
870 
its data processing to achieve business/mission objectives.  
871 
At Great Seneca Accounting, the PRAM helped elucidate how enabling employees to use their personal 
872 
devices for work-related functions can present privacy concerns for individuals. The PRAM also supports 
873 
the risk assessment task in the Prepare step of the NIST Risk Management Framework as discussed in 
874 
Appendix section E.1. The privacy events that were identified are below, along with potential 
875 
mitigations. 
876 
G.1 Problematic Data Action 1: Unwarranted restriction through blocking 
877 
access and wiping devices  
878 
Data Action: Devices can be wiped and reset to factory settings based on inputs regarding anomalous 
879 
activity and untrusted applications. 
880 
 
881 
Potential Problem for Individuals: In a BYOD environment, employees are likely to use their devices for 
882 
both personal and work-related purposes; thus, in a system that features robust security information 
883 
and event management capable of wiping a device entirely, there could be an issue of employees losing 
884 
personal data and employees may not even expect that this is a possibility. A hypothetical example is 
885 
that a Great Seneca Accounting employee stores personal photos on their mobile device, but these 
886 
photos are lost when their device is wiped after anomalous activity is detected. 
887 
Mitigations:  
888 
Block access to corporate resources by removing device from mobile device management (MDM) 
889 
control instead of wiping devices. 
890 
As an alternative to wiping data entirely, section F.4.3, Threat Event 3, discusses blocking a device from 
891 
accessing enterprise resources until an application is removed. Temporarily blocking access ensures that 
892 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device   
51 
an individual will not lose personal data through a full wipe of a device. This approach may help bring 
893 
the system’s capabilities into alignment with employees’ expectations about what can happen to their 
894 
devices, especially if they are unaware that devices can be wiped by administrators—providing greater 
895 
predictability in the system. 
896 
Related mitigation: If this mitigation approach is taken, the organization may also wish to consider 
897 
establishing and communicating these remediation processes to employees. It is important to have a 
898 
clear remediation process in place to help employees regain access to resources on their devices at the 
899 
appropriate time. It is also important to clearly convey this remediation process to employees. A 
900 
remediation process provides greater manageability in the system supporting employees’ ability to 
901 
access resources. If well communicated to employees, this also provides greater predictability as 
902 
employees will know the steps to regain access. 
903 
Enable only selective wiping of corporate resources on the device.  
904 
An alternative mitigation option for wiping device data is to limit what can be wiped. International 
905 
Business Machines’ (IBM’s) MaaS360 can be configured to selectively wipe instead of performing a full 
906 
factory reset. When configured this way, a wipe preserves employees’ personal configurations, 
907 
applications, and data while removing only the corporate configurations, applications, and data. 
908 
However, on Android, a selective wipe will preserve restrictions imposed via policy on the device. To 
909 
fully remove MDM control, the Remove Work Profile action must be used. 
910 
Advise employees to back up the personal data maintained on devices.  
911 
If device wiping remains an option for administrators, encourage employees to perform regular backups 
912 
of their personal data to ensure it remains accessible in case of a wipe. 
913 
Restrict staff access to system capabilities that permit removing device access or performing wipes.  
914 
Limit staff with the ability to perform a wipe to only those with that responsibility by using role-based 
915 
access controls. This can help decrease the chances of accidentally removing employee data or blocking 
916 
access to resources. 
917 
G.2 Problematic Data Action 2: Employee surveillance 
918 
Data Action: The assessed infrastructure offers Great Seneca Accounting and its employees a number of 
919 
security capabilities, including reliance on comprehensive monitoring capabilities, as noted in Section 4, 
920 
Architecture. Multiple parties could collect and analyze a significant amount of data relating to employ-
921 
ees, their devices, and their activities. 
922 
 
923 
Potential Problem for Individuals: Employees may not be aware that the organization has the ability to 
924 
monitor their interactions with the system and may not want this monitoring to occur. Collection and 
925 
analysis of information might enable Great Seneca Accounting or other parties to craft a narrative about 
926 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device   
52 
an employee based on the employee’s interactions with the system, which could lead to a power 
927 
imbalance between Great Seneca Accounting and the employee and loss of trust in the employer if the 
928 
employee discovers monitoring that they did not anticipate. 
929 
Mitigations: 
930 
Restrict staff access to system capabilities that permit reviewing data about employees and their 
931 
devices.  
932 
This may be achieved using role-based access controls. Access can be limited to any dashboard in the 
933 
system containing data about employees and their devices but is most sensitive for the MaaS360 
934 
dashboard, which is the hub for data about employees, their devices, and threats. Minimizing access to 
935 
sensitive information can enhance disassociability for employees using the system. 
936 
Limit or disable collection of specific data elements.  
937 
Conduct a system-specific privacy risk assessment to determine what elements can be limited. In the 
938 
configuration of MaaS360, location services and application inventory collection may be disabled. iOS 
939 
devices can be configured in MaaS360 to collect only an inventory of applications that have been 
940 
installed through the corporate application store instead of all applications installed on the device.  
941 
While these administrative configurations may help provide disassociability in the system, there are also 
942 
some opportunities for employees to limit the data collected. Employees can choose to disable location 
943 
services in their device OS to prevent collection of location data. MaaS360 can also be configured to 
944 
provide employees with the ability to manage their own devices through the IBM User Portal.  
945 
Each of these controls contributes to limiting the number of attributes regarding employees and their 
946 
devices that is collected, which can impede administrators’ ability to associate information with specific 
947 
individuals.  
948 
Dispose of personally identifiable information (PII).  
949 
Disposing of PII after an appropriate retention period can help reduce the risk of entities building 
950 
profiles of individuals. Disposal can also help bring the system’s data processing into alignment with 
951 
employees’ expectations and reduce the security risk associated with storing a large volume of PII. 
952 
Disposal may be particularly important for certain parties in the system that collect a larger volume of 
953 
data or more sensitive data. Disposal may be achieved using a combination of policy and technical 
954 
controls. Parties in the system may identify what happens to data, when, and how frequently.

G.3 Problematic Data Action 3: Unanticipated revelations through data 
956 
sharing across parties  
957 
Data Action: The infrastructure involves several parties that serve different purposes supporting Great 
958 
Seneca Accounting’s security objectives. As a result, device usage information could flow across various 
959 
parties.  
960 
 
961 
Potential Problems for Individuals: This transmission among a variety of different parties could be 
962 
confusing for employees who might not know who has access to information about them. If 
963 
administrators and co-workers know which colleagues are conducting activity on their device that 
964 
triggers security alerts, employees could be embarrassed by its disclosure. Information being revealed 
965 
and associated with specific employees could also lead to stigmatization and even impact Great Seneca 
966 
Accounting upper management in its decision-making regarding the employee. Further, clear text 
967 
transmissions could leave information vulnerable to attackers and therefore to unanticipated release of 
968 
employee information.  
969 
Mitigations:  
970 
De-identify personal and device data when such data is not necessary to meet processing objectives.  
971 
De-identifying data helps decrease the chances that a third party is aggregating information pertaining 
972 
to one individual. While de-identification can help reduce privacy risk, there are residual risks of re-
973 
identification.  
974 
Encrypt data transmitted between parties.  
975 
Encryption reduces the risk of compromise of information transmitted between parties. MaaS360 
976 
encrypts all communications over the internet with Transport Layer Security. 
977 
Limit or disable access to data.  
978 
Conduct a system-specific privacy risk assessment to determine how access to data can be limited. Using 
979 
access controls to limit staff access to compliance information, especially when associated with 
980 
individuals, can be important in preventing association of specific events with particular employees.  
981 
Limit or disable collection of specific data elements.  
982 
Conduct a system-specific privacy risk assessment to determine what elements can be limited. MaaS360 
983 
can be configured to limit collection of application and location data. Further, instead of collecting a list 
984 
of all the applications installed on the device, MaaS360 can collect only the list of those applications that 
985 
were installed through the corporate application store (called “managed applications”). This would 
986 
prevent insight into the employees’ applications that employees downloaded for personal use. 
987 
Zimperium provides privacy policies that can be configured to collect or not collect data items when 
988 
certain events occur. 
989 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario Supplement: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device   
54 
Use contracts to limit third-party data processing.  
990 
Establish contractual policies to limit data processing by third parties to only the processing that 
991 
facilitates delivery of security services and to no data processing beyond those explicit purposes. 
992 
G.4 Mitigations Applicable Across Various Data Actions 
993 
Several mitigations benefit employees in all three data actions identified in the privacy risk assessment. 
994 
The following training and support mitigations can help Great Seneca Accounting appropriately inform 
995 
employees about the system and its data processing. 
996 
Mitigations: 
997 
Train employees about the system, parties involved, data processing, and actions that administrators 
998 
can take.  
999 
Training sessions can also highlight any privacy-preserving techniques used, such as for disclosures to 
1000 
third parties. Training should include confirmation from employees that they understand the actions 
1001 
that administrators can take on their devices and their consequences–whether this is blocking access or 
1002 
wiping data. Employees may also be informed of data retention periods and when their data will be 
1003 
deleted. This can be more effective than sharing a privacy notice, which research has shown, individuals 
1004 
are unlikely to read. Still, MaaS360 should also be configured to provide employees with access to a 
1005 
visual privacy policy, which describes what device information is collected and why, as well as what 
1006 
actions administrators can take on the device. This enables employees to make better informed 
1007 
decisions while using their devices, and it enhances predictability. 
1008 
Provide ongoing notifications or reminders about system activity.  
1009 
This can be achieved using notifications to help directly link administrative actions on devices to relevant 
1010 
threats and to also help employees understand why an action is being taken. MaaS360 also notifies 
1011 
employees when changes are made to the privacy policy or MDM profile settings. These notifications 
1012 
can help increase system predictability by setting employee expectations appropriately regarding the 
1013 
way the system processes data and the resulting actions.  
1014 
Provide a support point of contact.  
1015 
By providing employees with a point of contact in the organization who can respond to inquiries and 
1016 
concerns regarding the system, employees can better understand how the system processes their data, 
1017 
which enhances predictability.

NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE 
21 
The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), a part of the National Institute of Standards 
22 
and Technology (NIST), is a collaborative hub where industry organizations, government agencies, and 
23 
academic institutions work together to address businesses’ most pressing cybersecurity issues. This 
24 
public-private partnership enables the creation of practical cybersecurity solutions for specific 
25 
industries, as well as for broad, cross-sector technology challenges. Through consortia under 
26 
Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), including technology partners—from 
27 
Fortune 50 market leaders to smaller companies specializing in information technology security—the 
28 
NCCoE applies standards and best practices to develop modular, easily adaptable example cybersecurity 
29 
solutions using commercially available technology. The NCCoE documents these example solutions in 
30 
the NIST Special Publication 1800 series, which maps capabilities to the NIST Cyber Security Framework 
31 
and details the steps needed for another entity to recreate the example solution. The NCCoE was 
32 
established in 2012 by NIST in partnership with the State of Maryland and Montgomery County, Md.

NIST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICE GUIDES 
36 
NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guides (Special Publication Series 1800) target specific cybersecurity 
37 
challenges in the public and private sectors. They are practical, user-friendly guides that facilitate the 
38 
adoption of standards-based approaches to cybersecurity. They show members of the information 
39 
security community how to implement example solutions that help them align with relevant standards 
40 
and best practices, and provide users with the materials lists, configuration files, and other information 
41 
they need to implement a similar approach. 
42 
The documents in this series describe example implementations of cybersecurity practices that 
43 
businesses and other organizations may voluntarily adopt. These documents do not describe regulations 
44 
or mandatory practices, nor do they carry statutory authority.  
45 
ABSTRACT 
46 
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) refers to the practice of performing work-related activities on personally 
47 
owned devices. This practice guide provides an example solution demonstrating how to enhance 
48 
security and privacy in Android and Apple smartphone BYOD deployments.  
49 
Incorporating BYOD capabilities into an organization can provide greater flexibility in how employees 
50 
work and increase the opportunities and methods available to access organizational resources. For some 
51 
organizations, the combination of traditional in-office processes with mobile device technologies 
52 
enables portable communication approaches and adaptive workflows. For others, it fosters a mobile-
53 

DRAFT 
NIST SP 1800-22C: Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device 
iii 
first approach in which their employees communicate and collaborate primarily using their mobile 
54 
devices. 
55 
However, some of the features that make BYOD mobile devices increasingly flexible and functional also 
56 
present unique security and privacy challenges to both work organizations and device owners. The 
57 
unique nature of these challenges is driven by the diverse range of devices available that vary in type, 
58 
age, operating system (OS), and the level of risk posed. 
59 
Enabling BYOD capabilities in the enterprise introduces new cybersecurity risks to organizations. 
60 
Solutions that are designed to secure corporate devices and on-premises data do not provide an 
61 
effective cybersecurity solution for BYOD. Finding an effective solution can be challenging due to the 
62 
unique risks that BYOD deployments impose. Additionally, enabling BYOD capabilities introduces new 
63 
privacy risks to employees by providing their employer a degree of access to their personal devices, 
64 
opening up the possibility of observation and control that would not otherwise exist. 
65 
To help organizations benefit from BYOD’s flexibility while protecting themselves from many of its 
66 
critical security and privacy challenges, this Practice Guide provides an example solution using 
67 
standards-based, commercially available products and step-by-step implementation guidance.

1 Introduction 
192 
The following volumes of this guide show information technology (IT) professionals and security 
193 
engineers how we implemented this example solution. We cover all of the products employed in this 
194 
reference design. We do not re-create the product manufacturers’ documentation, which is presumed 
195 
to be widely available. Rather, these volumes show how we incorporated the products together in our 
196 
environment. 
197 
Note: These are not comprehensive tutorials. There are many possible service and security configurations 
198 
for these products that are out of scope for this reference design. 
199 
1.1 Practice Guide Structure 
200 
This National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates a 
201 
standards-based reference design and provides users with the information they need to replicate 
202 
enhancing the security of bring your own device (BYOD) solutions. This reference design is modular and 
203 
can be deployed in whole or in part. 
204 
This guide contains four volumes: 
205 
 
NIST SP 1800-22A: Executive Summary 
206 
 
NIST SP 1800-22B: Approach, Architecture, and Security Characteristics – what we built and why 
207 
 
NIST SP 1800-22 Supplement: Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice – how 
208 
organizations can implement this example solution’s guidance 
209 
 
NIST SP 1800-22C: How-To Guides – instructions for building the example solution (you are 
210 
here) 
211 
 
212 
Depending on your role in your organization, you might use this guide in different ways: 
213 
Business decision makers, including chief security and technology officers, will be interested in the 
214 
Executive Summary, NIST SP 1800-22A, which describes the following topics: 
215 
 
challenges that enterprises face in managing the security of BYOD deployments 
216 
 
the example solution built at the NCCoE 
217 
 
benefits of adopting the example solution 
218 
Technology or security program managers who are concerned with how to identify, understand, assess, 
219 
and mitigate risk will be interested in NIST SP 1800-22B, which describes what we did and why. The 
220 
following sections will be of particular interest: 
221 
 
Section 4.1.4, Conduct a Risk Assessment, describes the risk analysis we performed. 
222

 
Appendix I, Example Security Control Map, maps the security characteristics of this example 
223 
solution to cybersecurity standards and best practices. 
224 
You might share the Executive Summary, NIST SP 1800-22A, with your leadership team members to help 
225 
them understand the importance of adopting standards-based BYOD solutions. 
226 
IT professionals who want to implement an approach like this will find this whole practice guide useful. 
227 
You can use this How-To portion of the guide, NIST SP 1800-22C, to replicate all or parts of the build 
228 
created in our lab. This How-To portion of the guide provides specific product installation, configuration, 
229 
and integration instructions for implementing the example solution. We do not recreate the product 
230 
manufacturers’ documentation, which is generally widely available. Rather, we show how we 
231 
incorporated the products together in our environment to create an example solution. 
232 
This guide assumes that IT professionals have experience implementing security products within the 
233 
enterprise. While we have used a suite of commercial products to address this challenge, this guide does 
234 
not endorse these particular products. Your organization can adopt this solution or one that adheres to 
235 
these guidelines in whole, or you can use this guide as a starting point for tailoring and implementing 
236 
parts of a BYOD solution. Your organization’s security experts should identify the products that will best 
237 
integrate with your existing tools and IT system infrastructure. We hope that you will seek products that 
238 
are congruent with applicable standards and best practices. Volume B, Section 3.7, Technologies, lists 
239 
the products that we used and maps them to the cybersecurity controls provided by this reference 
240 
solution. 
241 
For those who would like to see how the example solution can be implemented, this practice guide 
242 
contains an example scenario about a fictional company called Great Seneca Accounting. The example 
243 
scenario shows how BYOD objectives can align with an organization’s priority security and privacy 
244 
capabilities through NIST risk management standards, guidance, and tools. It is provided in this practice 
245 
guide’s supplement, NIST SP 1800-22 Example Scenario: Putting Guidance into Practice. 
246 
A NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide does not describe “the” solution, but a possible solution. This is a 
247 
draft guide. We seek feedback on its contents and welcome your input. Comments, suggestions, and 
248 
success stories will improve subsequent versions of this guide. Please contribute your thoughts to 
249 
mobile-nccoe@nist.gov. 
250 
1.2 Build Overview 
251 
In our lab at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), NIST engineers built an 
252 
environment that contains an example solution for managing the security of BYOD deployments. In this 
253 
guide, we show how an enterprise can leverage this example solution’s concepts to implement 
254 
Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM), mobile threat defense, application vetting, secure boot/image 
255 
authentication, and virtual private network (VPN) services in support of a BYOD solution.  
256

These technologies were configured to protect organizational assets and end-user privacy, providing 
257 
methodologies to enhance the data protection posture of the adopting organization. The standards, 
258 
best practices, and certification programs that this example solution is based upon help ensure the 
259 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of enterprise data on mobile systems.

2 Product Installation Guides 
268 
This section of the practice guide contains detailed instructions for installing and configuring all of the 
269 
products used to build an instance of the example solution.  
270 
This guide assumes that a basic active directory (AD) infrastructure has been configured. The domain 
271 
controller (DC) is used to authenticate users when enrolling devices as well as when connecting to the 
272 
virtual private network (VPN). In this implementation, the domain enterprise.mds.local was used. 
273 
2.1 Network Device Enrollment Services Server 
274 
A Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES)/Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) server was 
275 
used to issue client certificates to new devices that were enrolled by using MaaS360. This guide assumes 
276 
that a basic AD infrastructure is in place.

279 
Configuration guide: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Windows-Server-2016-Active-165e88d1 
280 
Configuration changes that were made: 
281 
 
The Root CA Name was changed to ROOT-CA. 
282 
 
The Issuing CA Name was changed to SUB-CA. 
283 
 
The entry for DC=srv,DC=lab was replaced with DC=enterprise,DC=mds,DC=local at various 
284 
points throughout the guide. 
285 
2.1.1.1 Export Certificates 
286 
This section assumes that a location exists that is accessible by all machines on the network, such as a 
287 
shared folder or network drive. Furthermore, this section assumes that configuration of the root and 
288 
subordinate CA has been completed. 
289

31. Expand the following key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MSCEP. 
348 
32. Right-click on MSCEP, and select New > Key. Name it PasswordMax. 
349 
33. Right-click on the newly created key and select New > DWORD (32-bit) Value.  
350 
34. Name it PasswordMax, and give it a value of 0x00003e8. This increases the NDES password 
351 
cache to 1,000 entries instead of the default 5. This value can be further adjusted based on 
352 
NDES demands. 
353 
Figure 2-2 PasswordMax Registry Configuration 
354 
 
Note: The PasswordMax key governs the maximum number of NDES passwords that can reside in the 
355 
cache. A password is cached when a valid certificate request is received, and it is removed from the 
356 
cache when the password is used or when 60 minutes have elapsed, whichever occurs first. If the 
357 
PasswordMax key is not present, the default value of 5 is used. 
358 
1. In an elevated command prompt, execute %windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd set config 
359 
/section:requestFiltering /requestLimits.maxQueryString:8192 to increase the maxi-

2.4.5.2 Configure SSL Website Blocking 
796 
Note: This section is optional. Section 2.4.5.1 outlines how to configure basic URL filtering, which will 
797 
serve a URL blocked page for unencrypted (http [hypertext transfer protocol]) connections, and it will 
798 
send a transmission control protocol reset for encrypted (https [hypertext transfer protocol secure]) 
799 
connections, which will show a default browser error page. This section outlines how to configure the 
800 
firewall so that it can serve the same error page for https connections as it does for http connections. 
801 
This is purely for user experience and has no impact on blocking functionality.
